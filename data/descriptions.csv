Q7726654,"No writer stretches the boundaries of science fiction LIKE Wil McCarthy does. Now this acclaimed author has crafted his most wildly ambitious and stunningly original novel yet, an unforgettable tale set in a wondrous future in which the secrets of matter have been unlocked and death itself is but a memory. A future also imperiled by a bitter rivalry between two brilliant scientists: one perhaps the greatest genius in the history of humankind, the other, its greatest monster . . .In the eighth decade of the glorious reign of Her Majesty Tamra Lutui, the Queendom of Sol enjoys a peace and prosperity even gods might envy. In fact, two awesome technologies have given human beings all the powers--and caprices--of the gods they once worshiped. The first is wellstone, a form of programmable matter capable of emulating almost any substance: natural, artificial, even hypothetical. The second is collapsium, a deadly crystal, composed of miniature black holes, that allows the virtually instantaneous transmission of information and matter--including humans--throughout the solar system.Bruno de Towaji, royal consort and the inventor of collapsium, dreams of building the arc de fin, an almost mythical device capable of probing the farthest reaches of spacetime. Marlon Sykes, de Towaji's rival in both love and science, is meanwhile hard at work on a vast telecommunications project whose first step consists of constructing a ring of collapsium around the sun. But when a ruthless saboteur attacks the Ring Collapsiter and sends it falling toward the sun, the two scientists must put aside personal animosity and combine their prodigious intellects to prevent the destruction of the solar system . . . and every living thing within it.In his most daring work yet, Wil McCarthy blasts us into a mythical realm--by turns hilarious, magnificent, and deeply moving--where two archmasters of physics compete for love and honor against a backdrop of stellar catastrophe. The Collapsium is a bold work of the imagination.From the Hardcover edition."

Detective Elijah Baley is called to the Spacer world Aurora to solve a bizarre case of roboticide.

Q3235534,"George R. R. Martin has thrilled a generation of readers with his epic works of the imagination, most recently the critically acclaimed New York Times bestselling saga told in the novels A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords. Lisa Tuttle has won acclaim from fans of science fiction, horror, and fantasy alike -- most recently for her haunting novel  The Pillow Friend. Now together they gift readers with this classic tale of a brilliantly rendered world of ironbound tradition, where a rebellious soul seeks to prove the power of a dream.The planet of Windhaven was not originally a home to humans, but it became one following the crash of a colony starship. It is a world of small islands, harsh weather, and monster-infested seas. Communication among the scattered settlements was virtually impossible until the discovery that, thanks to light gravity and a dense atmosphere, humans were able to fly with the aid of metal wings made of bits of the cannibalized spaceship.Many generations later, among the scattered islands that make up the water world of Windhaven, no one holds more prestige than the silver-winged flyers, who bring news, gossip, songs, and stories. They are romantic figures crossing treacherous oceans, braving shifting winds and sudden storms that could easily dash them from the sky to instant death. They are also members of an increasingly elite caste, for the wings -- always in limited quantity -- are growing gradually rarer as their bearers perish.With such elitism comes arrogance and a rigid adherence to hidebound tradition. And for the flyers, allowing just anyone to join their cadre is an idea that borders on heresy. Wings are meant only for the offspring of flyers -- now the new nobility of Windhaven. Except that sometimes life is not quite so neat.Maris of Amberly, a fisherman's daughter, was raised by a flyer and wants nothing more than to soar on the currents high above Windhaven. By tradition, however, the wings must go to her stepbrother, Coll, the flyer's legitimate son. But Coll wants only to be a singer, traveling the world by sea. So Maris challenges tradition, demanding that flyers be chosen on the basis of merit rather than inheritance. And when she wins that bitter battle, she discovers that her troubles are only beginning.For not all flyers are willing to accept the world's new structure, and as Maris battles to teach those who yearn to fly, she finds herself likewise fighting to preserve the integrity of a society she so longed to join -- not to mention the very fabric that holds her culture together.From the Hardcover edition."

Q2441281,"The Einstein Intersection won the Nebula Award for best science fiction novel of 1967. The surface story tells of the problems a member of an alien race, Lo Lobey, has assimilating the mythology of earth, where his kind have settled among the leftover artifacts of humanity. The deeper tale concerns, however, the way those who are ""different"" must deal with the dominant cultural ideology. The tale follows Lobey's mythic quest for his lost love, Friza. In luminous and hallucinated language, it explores what new myths might emerge from the detritus of the human world as those who are ""different"" try to seize history and the day."
Q2027568,"When Robin wakes up in a clinic with most of his memories missing, it doesn't take him long to discover that someone is trying to kill him. It's the 27th century, when interstellar travel is by teleport gate and conflicts are fought by network worms that censor refugees' personalities and target historians.

> Light is the kind of novel other writers read and think: ""Why don't I just give up and go home?"" That was certainly my first reaction on reading its mix of coldly perfect prose and attractively twisted insanity. It's also the only book to bring me unpleasantly close to sympathising with a serial killer. But this is M John Harrison: so antihero Michael Kearney is a mathematically brilliant, dice-throwing, reality-changing hyper-intelligent serial killer haunted by a horse-skulled personal demon.

> Harrison's genius is to tie Kearney's narrative thread to those of Seria Mau – a far-future girl existing in harmony with White Cat, her spaceship, surfing a part of the galaxy known as the Kefahuchi Tract – and Chinese Ed, a sleazy if likeable cyberpunky chancer with a passion for virtual sex.

> This is not a kind book, or even a particularly likeable book. But then I suspected it was never intended to be, and the author wouldn't want the kind of people who want to like characters as his readers anyway. What it is is stunningly written, meticulously plotted, hallucinogenically realised and brutally honest. No one who reads it could doubt that Harrison might win the Booker if he could be bothered.

> Light is also the book that novelist and critic Adam Roberts was so sure would win the Arthur C Clarke award, he offered to change his name to Adam Van Hoogenroberts if it didn't. We're still waiting . . .

The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K Le Guin (1969)

> One of my favorite novels is The Left Hand of Darkness, by Ursula K Le Guin. For more than 40 years I've been recommending this book to people who want to try science fiction for the first time, and it still serves very well for that. One of the things I like about it is how clearly it demonstrates that science fiction can have not only the usual virtues and pleasures of the novel, but also the startling and transformative power of the thought experiment.

> In this case, the thought experiment is quickly revealed: ""The king was pregnant,"" the book tells us early on, and after that we learn more and more about this planet named Winter, stuck in an ice age, where the humans are most of the time neither male nor female, but with the potential to become either. The man from Earth investigating this situation has a lot to learn, and so do we; and we learn it in the course of a thrilling adventure story, including a great ""crossing of the ice"". Le Guin's language is clear and clean, and has within it both the anthropological mindset of her father Alfred Kroeber, and the poetry of stories as magical things that her mother Theodora Kroeber found in native American tales. This worldly wisdom applied to the romance of other planets, and to human nature at its deepest, is Le Guin's particular gift to us, and something science fiction will always be proud of. Try it and see – you will never think about people in quite the same way again.

Q586831,"The citizens of the planet Lithia are some of the most ethical sentient beings Father Ramon Ruiz-Sanchez has ever encountered. True, they have no literature, no fine arts, and don't understand the concept of recreation, but neither do they understand the concepts of greed, envy, lust, or any of the sins and vices that plague humankind. Their world seems darned near perfect. And that is just what disturbs the good Father.

First published in 1959, James Blish's Hugo Award-winning A Case of Conscience is science fiction at its very best: a fast-paced, intelligent story that offers plenty of action while at the same time explores complex questions of values and ethics. In this case, Blish has taken on the age-old battle of good vs. evil. Lithia poses a theological question that lies at the heart of this book: is God necessary for a moral society? The Lithians are nothing if not moral. Not only do they lack the seven deadly sins, they also lack original sin. And without any sort of religious framework, they have created the Christian ideal world, one that humans would be eager to study and emulate. But is it too perfect? Is it in fact, as Father Ruiz-Sanchez suspects, the work of The Adversary? And what role does Egtverchi, the young Lithian raised on Earth, play? Is he an innocent victim of circumstance, or will he bring about the Dies Irae, the day of the wrath of God, upon the earth? The fate of two worlds hinges on the answers to these questions, and will lead to an ancient earth heresy that shakes the Jesuit priest's beliefs to their very core.

A Case of Conscience is a brilliant piece of storytelling, and it packs a lot into a scant 242 pages.

It is an outfit so secret that only a handful of people know it exists, and some of those people have names like Churchill and Roosevelt. The mission of Watrehouse and Detachment 2702 - commanded by Marine Raider Bobby Shaftoe - is to keep the Nazis ignorant of the fact that Allied Intelligence has cracked the enemy's fabled Enigma code. It is a game, a cryptographic chess match between Waterhouse and his German counterpart, translated into action by the gung-ho Shaftoe and his forces.

As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe's tough-as-nails granddaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi submarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat.

Q6690221,"Pierce Moffett stands at a turning point, when the world is changing from what it has been into what it will be. Is it only a moment in the history of his own soul? Or the course of his generation's progress toward maturity?

As a child Pierce was no stranger to magic. Transplanted from his native Brooklyn to the Cumberland Mountains of Kentucky, he and his cousins formed a secret club called the Invisible College. Fueled by books, adventures, and the imagination of youth, they scratched the surface of ordinary life and found the hints of something glittering and strange underneath.

For most children these revelations fade with the coming of adulthood, but for Pierce the search for the hidden history of the world is just beginning.

It is a search that begins with the unfinished manuscript of a writer named Fellowes Kraft and leads to the real-life history of the doomed heretic Giordano Bruno and the Elizabethan metaphysician John Dee. These mysteries reach from past to present, to intertwine themselves with the life of Rosie Rasmussen, who brought Pierce that unfinished manuscript and will be given charge of Pierce's destiny.

And as he delves deeper, Pierce begins to apprehend a power beyond reckoning, a knowledge beyond imagining, and a love that can waken sleeping souls.

Thirty thousand years before the events of *A Fire upon the Deep*, Pham Nuwen is living in anonymity among the Qeng Ho interstellar trading fleet.  In high orbit above the planet Arachna, they wait for the awakening of its dormant population, the Spiders, who have burrowed deep into the planet, awaiting the relighting of the On/Off star their planet orbits.  For when light returns, Arachna will at long last explode into a Golden Age of technology and commerce.

But the slumbering Spiders' vulnerability has attracted another lurking presence -- the Emergents, a band of traders whose plans for Arachna are more sinister than anything the Qeng Ho could envision.

Reluctant to share their spoils with the Qeng Ho, the Emergents unleash an attack unlike any seen in the Qeng Ho's millennia-long history of exploration, reducing their fleet to serfdom... and then to something worse.

Reaching into memories so old and painful he can barely recall them, Pham gathers the other ""survivors"" about him and makes a final attempt to be worthy of a reputation as ancient and storied as the history of the Qeng Ho itself.  But time is running out, for soon the Emergents' assault will strip Arachna bare.

Q97162038,"**Cory Doctorow's *Attack Surface* is a standalone novel set in the world of New York Times bestsellers *Little Brother* and *Homeland*.**

Most days, Masha Maximow was sure she'd chosen the winning side.

In her day job as a counterterrorism wizard for an transnational cybersecurity firm, she made the hacks that allowed repressive regimes to spy on dissidents, and manipulate their every move. The perks were fantastic, and the pay was obscene.

Just for fun, and to piss off her masters, Masha sometimes used her mad skills to help those same troublemakers evade detection, if their cause was just. It was a dangerous game and a hell of a rush. But seriously self-destructive. And unsustainable.

When her targets were strangers in faraway police states, it was easy to compartmentalize, to ignore the collateral damage of murder, rape, and torture. But when it hits close to home, and the hacks and exploits she’s devised are directed at her friends and family--including boy wonder Marcus Yallow, her old crush and archrival, and his entourage of naïve idealists--Masha realizes she has to choose.

And whatever choice she makes, someone is going to get hurt.

Q4198261,"Ray Bradbury, America's most beloved storyteller, has spent a lifetime carrying readers to exhilarating and dangerous places, from dark street comers in unfamiliar cities and towns to the edge of the universe. Now, in an extraordinary flight of the imagination a half-century in the making, he takes us to a most wondrous destination: into the heart of an Eternal Family.

They have lived for centuries in a house of legend and mystery in upper Illinois -- and they are not like other midwesterners. Rarely encountered in daylight hours, their children are curious and wild; their old ones have survived since before the Sphinx first sank its paws deep in Egyptian sands. And some sleep in beds with lids.

Now the house is being readied in anticipation of the gala homecoming that will gather together the farflung branches of this odd and remarkable family. In the past-midnight stillness can be detected the soft fluttering of Uncle Einars wings. From her realm of sleep, Cecy, the fairest and most special daughter, can feel the approach of many a welcome being -- shapeshifter, telepath, somnambulist, vampire -- as she flies high in the consciousness of bird and bat.

But in the midst of eager anticipation, a sense of doom pervades. For the world is changing. And death, no stranger, will always shadow this most singular family: Father, arisen from the Earth; Mother, who never sleeps but dreams; A Thousand Times Great Grandmére; Grandfather, who keeps the wildness of youth between his ears.

And the boy who, more than anyone, carries the burden of time on his shoulders: Timothy, the sad and different foundling son who must share it all, remember, and tell...and who, alone out of all of them, must one day age and wither and die.

By turns lyrical, wistful, poignant, and chilling, From the Dust Returned is the long-awaited new novel by the peerless Ray Bradbury -- a book that will surely be numbered among his most enduring masterworks."

A new group has taken over the Hall of the Presidents, and is replacing its venerable audioanimatronics with new, immersive direct-to-brain interfaces that give guests the illusion of being Washington, Lincoln, and all the others. For Jules, this is an attack on the artistic purity of Disney World itself. 

Worse: it appears this new group has had Jules killed. This upsets him. (It's only his fourth death and revival, after all.) Now it's war ....

Over the centuries, cities and governments have risen and fallen beyond the concent's walls.

So it's somewhat disconcerting when Lord Vetinari summons Moist to the palace and asks, ""Tell me, Mr. Lipwig, would you like to make some real money?""Vetinari isn't talking about wages, of course. He's referring, rather, to the Royal Mint of Ankh-Morpork, a venerable institution that haas run for centuries on the hereditary employment of the Men of the Sheds and their loyal outworkers, who do make money in their spare time. Unfortunately, it costs more than a penny to make a penny, so the whole process seems somewhat counterintuitive.Next door, at the Royal Bank, the Glooper, an ""analogy machine,"" has scientifically established that one never has quite as much money at the end of the week as one thinks one should, and the bank's chairman, one elderly Topsy (nee Turvy) Lavish, keeps two loaded crossbows at her desk.

He’s not famous, except to the people who matter. He’s made some pretty powerful people happy in his time, and he’s been paid pretty well. It’s been a good life.

Part of a small group of high-functioning autistic adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact. He has taught himself to use ""please"" and ""thank you"" and other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable.

Would he still see the same colors and patterns in the world--shades and hues that others cannot see? Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to reciprocate his feelings?

Q684818,"In a world renowned even within a galaxy full of wonders, a crime within a war. For one brother it means a desperate flight, and a search for the one - maybe two - people who could clear his name. For his brother it means a life lived under constant threat of treachery and murder. And for their sister, even without knowing the full truth, it means returning to a place she'd thought abandoned forever. Only the sister is not what she once was; Djan Seriy Anaplian has changed almost beyond recognition to become an agent of the Culture's Special Circumstances section, charged with high-level interference in civilisations throughout the greater galaxy. Concealing her new identity - and her particular set of abilities - might be a dangerous strategy, however. In the world to which Anaplian returns, nothing is quite as it seems; and determining the appropriate level of interference in someone else's war is never a simple matter. MATTER is a novel of dazzling wit and serious purpose. An extraordinary feat of storytelling and breathtaking invention on a grand scale, it is a tour de force from a writer who has turned science fiction on its head."

Q2268557,"Nicola Griffith, winner of the Tiptree Award and the Lambda Award for her widely acclaimed first novel Ammonite, now turns her attention closer to the present in Slow River, the dark and intensely involving story of a young woman's struggle for survival and independence on the gritty underside of a near-future Europe.She awoke in an alley to the splash of rain. She was naked, a foot-long gash in her back was still bleeding, and her identity implant was gone. Lore Van de Oest was the daughter of one of the world's most powerful families...and now she was nobody. Then out of the rain walked Spanner, an expert data pirate who took her in, cared for her wounds, and gave her the freedom to reinvent herself again and again. No one could find Lore if she didn't want to be found: not the police, not her family, and not the kidnappers who had left her in that alley to die. She had escaped...but she paid for her newfound freedom in crime, deception, and degradation--over and over again. Lore had a choice: She could stay in the shadows, stay with Spanner...and risk losing herself forever. Or she could leave Spanner and find herself again by becoming someone else: stealing the identity implant of a dead woman, taking over her life, and inventing her future.But to start again, Lore required Spanner's talents--Spanner, who needed her and hated her, and who always had a price. And even as Lore agreed to play Spanner's games one final time, she found that there was still the price of being a Van de Oest to be paid. Only by confronting her past, her family, and her own demons could Lore meld together who she had once been, who she had become, and the person she intended to be....In Slow River, Nicola Griffith skillfully takes us deep into the mind and heart of her complex protagonist, where the past must be reconciled with the present if the future is ever to offer solid ground. Slow River poses a question we all hope never to need to answer: Who are you when you have nothing left? From the Hardcover edition."

Q1140295,"Cormac McCarthy's tenth novel, The Road, is his most harrowing yet deeply personal work. Some unnamed catastrophe has scourged the world to a burnt-out cinder, inhabited by the last remnants of mankind and a very few surviving dogs and fungi. The sky is perpetually shrouded by dust and toxic particulates; the seasons are merely varied intensities of cold and dampness. Bands of cannibals roam the roads and inhabit what few dwellings remain intact in the woods.

Through this nightmarish residue of America a haggard father and his young son attempt to flee the oncoming Appalachian winter and head towards the southern coast along carefully chosen back roads. Mummified corpses are their only benign companions, sitting in doorways and automobiles, variously impaled or displayed on pikes and tables and in cake bells, or they rise in frozen poses of horror and agony out of congealed asphalt. The boy and his father hope to avoid the marauders, reach a milder climate, and perhaps locate some remnants of civilization still worthy of that name. They possess only what they can scavenge to eat, and the rags they wear and the heat of their own bodies are all the shelter they have. A pistol with only a few bullets is their only defense besides flight. Before them the father pushes a shopping cart filled with blankets, cans of food and a few other assets, like jars of lamp oil or gasoline siphoned from the tanks of abandoned vehicles—the cart is equipped with a bicycle mirror so that they will not be surprised from behind.

Through encounters with other survivors brutal, desperate or pathetic, the father and son are both hardened and sustained by their will, their hard-won survivalist savvy, and most of all by their love for each other. They struggle over mountains, navigate perilous roads and forests reduced to ash and cinders, endure killing cold and freezing rainfall. Passing through charred ghost towns and ransacking abandoned markets for meager provisions, the pair battle to remain hopeful. They seek the most rudimentary sort of salvation. However, in The Road, such redemption as might be permitted by their circumstances depends on the boy’s ability to sustain his own instincts for compassion and empathy in opposition to his father’s insistence upon their mutual self-interest and survival at all physical and moral costs.

The Road was the winner of the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for Literature.

But Daenerys has thousands of enemies, and many have set out to find her. As they gather, one young man embarks upon his own quest for the queen, with an entirely different goal in mind.

Fleeing from Westeros with a price on his head, Tyrion Lannister, too, is making his way to Daenerys. But his newest allies in this quest are not the rag-tag band they seem, and at their heart lies one who could undo Daenerys’s claim to Westeros forever.

Q7767840,"'Tis done.The world is a most confused and unsteady place -- especially London, center of finance, innovation, and conspiracy -- in the year 1714, when Daniel Waterhouse makes his less-than-triumphant return to England's shores. Aging Puritan and Natural Philosopher, confidant of the high and mighty and contemporary of the most brilliant minds of the age, he has braved the merciless sea and an assault by the infamous pirate Blackbeard to help mend the rift between two adversarial geniuses at a princess's behest. But while much has changed outwardly, the duplicity and danger that once drove Daniel to the American Colonies is still coin of the British realm.No sooner has Daniel set foot on his homeland when he is embroiled in a dark conflict that has been raging in the shadows for decades. It is a secret war between the brilliant, enigmatic Master of the Mint and closet alchemist Isaac Newton and his archnemesis, the insidious counterfeiter Jack the Coiner, a.k.a.

Hostilities are suddenly moving to a new and more volatile level, as Half-Cocked Jack plots a daring assault on the Tower itself, aiming for nothing less than the total corruption of Britain's newborn monetary system.Unbeknownst to all, it is love that set the Coiner on his traitorous course; the desperate need to protect the woman of his heart -- the remarkable Eliza, Duchess of Arcachon-Qwghlm -- from those who would destroy her should he fail.

Q4398917,"Volume One of The Baroque Cycle 
(Not to be confused with [Quicksilver: The Baroque Cycle #1](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18199543W/Quicksilver))

Quicksilver is a massive, exuberant and wildly ambitious historical novel that's also Neal Stephenson's eagerly awaited prequel to Cryptonomicon--his pyrotechnic reworking of the 20th century, from World War II codebreaking and disinformation to the latest issues of Internet data privacy.

Quicksilver, ""Volume One of the Baroque Cycle"", backtracks to another time of high intellectual ferment: the late 17th century, with the natural philosophers of England's newly formed Royal Society questioning the universe and dissecting everything that moves. One founding member, the Rev John Wilkins, really did write science fiction and a book on cryptography--but this isn't history as we know it, for here his code book is called not Mercury but Cryptonomicon. And although the key political schemers of Charles II's government still have initials spelling the word CABAL, their names are all different...

While towering geniuses like Newton and Leibniz decode nature itself, bizarre adventures (merely beginning with the Great Plague and Great Fire) happen to the fictional Royal Society member Daniel Waterhouse, who knows everyone but isn't quite bright enough for cutting-edge science. Two generations of Daniel's family appear in Cryptonomicon, as does a descendant of the Shaftoes who here are soldiers and vagabonds. Other links include the island realm of Qwghlm with its impossible language and the mysterious, seemingly ageless alchemist Enoch Root.

As the reign of Charles II gives way to that of James II and then William of Orange, Stephenson traces the complex lines of finance and power that form the 17th-century Internet. Gold and silver, lead and (repeatedly) mercury or quicksilver flow in glittering patterns between centres of marketing and intrigue in England, Germany, France and Holland. Paper flows as well: stocks, shares, scams and letters holding layers of concealed code messages. Binary code? Yes, even that had already been invented and described by Francis Bacon.

Quicksilver is crammed with unexpected incidents, fascinating digressions and deep-laid plots. Who'd believe that Eliza, a Qwghlmian slave girl liberated from a Turkish harem by mad Jack Shaftoe (King of the Vagabonds) could become a major player in European finance and politics? Still less believable, but all too historically authentic, are the appalling medical procedures of the time--about which we learn a lot. There are frequent passages of high comedy, like the lengthy description of a foppish earl's costume which memorably explains that someone seemed to have been painted in glue before ""shaking and rolling him in a bin containing thousands of black silk doilies"".

This is a huge, exhausting read, full of rewards and quirky insights that no other author could have created. Fantastic or farcical episodes sometimes clash strangely with the deep cruelty and suffering of 17th-century realism. Recommended, though not to the faint-hearted.

Charlie must find a way to get a skeptical administration to act before it's too late--and his progeny find themselves living in Swamp World. But the political climate poses almost as great a challenge as the environmental crisis when it comes to putting the public good ahead of private gain.  While Charlie struggles to play politics, his wife, Anna, takes a more rational approach to the looming crisis in her work at the National Science Foundation. There a proposal has come in for a revolutionary process that could solve the problem of global warming--if it can be recognized in time. But when a race to control the budding technology begins, the stakes only get higher. As these everyday heroes fight to align the awesome forces of nature with the extraordinary march of modern science, they are unaware that fate is about to put an unusual twist on their work--one that will place them at the heart of an unavoidable storm.

Q3234544,"The planet called Harmony had been settled by humans nearly forty million years before. The colony had been placed under the care of an artificial intelligence, called the Oversoul, high in orbit. This master computer had one overriding command: Guard the people of Harmony against the dangers that destroyed humankind on Earth and other worlds. But now the Oversoul was itself in danger. Its systems were failing. Soon, within a thousand years, catastrophic war would break out on Harmony unless the Oversoul could be repaired.

The Oversoul determined that its core must be taken back to lost Earth, to interface with the Master Computer there, to be repaired and reprogrammed. But in order to do that, someone on Harmony must be given back the knowledge of space travel. And so the Oversoul must interfere directly with individuals on Harmony, in order to save the planet from disaster.

And so, on the planet, while on the road to the city called Basilica, a man named Wetchik had a vision of destruction, sent by the Oversoul. Soon his sons, Elemak, Issib, Mebbekew and Nafai were drawn into conflict-with the city and with each other-as the Oversoul began destabilizing forty million years of social engineering.

Q2468406,"From the master of alternate history comes an epic of the Second Civil War. It was an epoch of glory and success, of disaster and despair. Twenty years after the South won the Civil War, America writhed once more in the bloody throes of battle. Furious over the annexation of key Mexican territory, the United States declared total war against the Confederate States of America. And so, in 1883, the fragile peace was shattered.But this was a new kind of war, fought on a lawless frontier where the blue and gray battled not only each other, but the Apache, the outlaw, and even the redcoat. Along with France, England entered the fray on the side of the South, with blockades and invasions from Canada. Out of this tragic struggle emerged figures great and small. The disgraced Abraham Lincoln crisscrossed the nation championing socialist ideals. Confederate cavalry leader Jeb Stuart sought to prevent wholesale slaughter in the desert Southwest, while cocky young Theodore Roosevelt and stodgy George Custer bickered over modern weapons--even as they drove the British back into western Canada.Thanks to the efforts of journalists like Samuel Clemens, the nation witnessed the clash of human dreams and passions. Confederate genius Stonewall Jackson again soared to the heights of military expertise, while the North's McClellan proved sadly undeserving of his once shining reputation as the ""young Napoleon.""  For in the Second War Between the States, the times, the stakes, and the battle lines had changed . . . and so would history.Once again, Harry Turtledove has created a thoroughly engrossing alternate history novel, a profoundly original epic of blood and honor, courage and sacrifice, set amidst the raw beauty of young America's frontier wilderness.From the Hardcover edition."

Q1143215,"Beneath the towering bleached ribs of a dead, ancient beast lies New Crobuzon, a squalid city where humans, Re-mades, and arcane races live in perpetual fear of Parliament and its brutal militia. The air and rivers are thick with factory pollutants and the strange effluents of alchemy, and the ghettos contain a vast mix of workers, artists, spies, junkies, and whores. In New Crobuzon, the unsavory deal is stranger to none—not even to Isaac, a brilliant scientist with a penchant for Crisis Theory.

Isaac has spent a lifetime quietly carrying out his unique research. But when a half-bird, half-human creature known as the Garuda comes to him from afar, Isaac is faced with challenges he has never before fathomed. Though the Garuda's request is scientifically daunting, Isaac is sparked by his own curiosity and an uncanny reverence for this curious stranger.

While Isaac's experiments for the Garuda turn into an obsession, one of his lab specimens demands attention: a brilliantly colored caterpillar that feeds on nothing but a hallucinatory drug and grows larger—and more consuming—by the day. What finally emerges from the silken cocoon will permeate every fiber of New Crobuzon—and not even the Ambassador of Hell will challenge the malignant terror it invokes . . .

The story follows Johnny Smith, who awakens from a coma of nearly five years and, apparently as a result of brain damage, now experiences clairvoyant and precognitive visions triggered by touch. When some information is blocked from his perception, Johnny refers to that information as being trapped in the part of his brain that is permanently damaged, ""the dead zone."" The novel also follows a serial killer in Castle Rock, and the life of rising politician Greg Stillson, both of whom are evils Johnny must eventually face.

Though earlier King books were successful, The Dead Zone was the first of his novels to rank among the ten best-selling novels of the year in the United States. The book was nominated for the Locus Award in 1980 and was dedicated to King's son Owen. The Dead Zone is the first story by King to feature the fictional town of Castle Rock, which serves as the setting for several later stories and is referenced in others. The TV series Castle Rock takes place in this fictional town and makes references to the Strangler whom Johnny helped track down in The Dead Zone.

Political power has been grabbed by a few powerful families and their green saints. Millions of people are imprisoned in teeming cities; millions more labour on Pharaonic projects to rebuild ruined ecosystems. On the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, the Outers, descendants of refugees from Earth's repressive regimes, have constructed a wild variety of self-sufficient cities and settlements: scientific utopias crammed with exuberant creations of the genetic arts; the last outposts of every kind of democratic tradition.

The fragile detente between the Outer cities and the dynasties of Earth is threatened by the ambitions of the rising generation of Outers, who want to break free of their cosy, inward-looking pocket paradises, colonise the rest of the Solar System, and drive human evolution in a hundred new directions. On Earth, many demand pre-emptive action against the Outers before it's too late; others want to exploit the talents of their scientists and gene wizards. Amid campaigns for peace and reconciliation, political machinations, crude displays of military might, and espionage by cunningly wrought agents, the two branches of humanity edge towards war..."

Q1764445,"Few books have captivated the imagination and won the devotion and praise of readers and critics everywhere as has George R. R. Martin’s monumental epic cycle of high fantasy. Now, in A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace . . . only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction.


It seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King’s Landing. Robb Stark’s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist—or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out. 

But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces—some familiar, others only just appearing—are seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead. 

It is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strong will acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible times that lie before them. It is a time for nobles and commoners, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and sages to come together and stake their fortunes . . . and their lives. For at a feast for crows, many are the guests—but only a few are the survivors."
Q18366291,"In her first novel since 2002, Nebula and Hugo award-winning author Connie Willis returns with a stunning, enormously entertaining novel of time travel, war, and the deeds--great and small--of ordinary people who shape history. In the hands of this acclaimed storyteller, the past and future collide--and the result is at once intriguing, elusive, and frightening.Oxford in 2060 is a chaotic place. Scores of time-traveling historians are being sent into the past, to destinations including the American Civil War and the attack on the World Trade Center. Michael Davies is prepping to go to Pearl Harbor. Merope Ward is coping with a bunch of bratty 1940 evacuees and trying to talk her thesis adviser, Mr. Dunworthy, into letting her go to VE Day. Polly Churchill's next assignment will be as a shopgirl in the middle of London's Blitz. And seventeen-year-old Colin Templer, who has a major crush on Polly, is determined to go to the Crusades so that he can ""catch up"" to her in age.  But now the time-travel lab is suddenly canceling assignments for no apparent reason and switching around everyone's schedules. And when Michael, Merope, and Polly finally get to World War II, things just get worse. For there they face air raids, blackouts, unexploded bombs, dive-bombing Stukas, rationing, shrapnel, V-1s, and two of the most incorrigible children in all of history--to say nothing of a growing feeling that not only their assignments but the war and history itself are spiraling out of control. Because suddenly the once-reliable mechanisms of time travel are showing significant glitches, and our heroes are beginning to question their most firmly held belief: that no historian can possibly change the past.From the people sheltering in the tube stations of London to the retired sailors who set off across the Channel to rescue the stranded British Army from Dunkirk, from shopgirls to ambulance drivers, from spies to hospital nurses to Shakespearean actors, Blackout reveals a side of World War II seldom seen before: a dangerous, desperate world in which there are no civilians and in which everybody--from the Queen down to the lowliest barmaid--is determined to do their bit to help a beleaguered nation survive.From the Hardcover edition."
Q944991,"Two 19th century stage illusionists, the aristocratic Rupert Angier and the working-class Alfred Borden, engage in a bitter and deadly feud; the effects are still being felt by their respective families a hundred years later. Working in the gaslight-and-velvet world of Victorian music halls, they prowl edgily in the background of each other's shadowy life, driven to the extremes by a deadly combination of obsessive secrecy and insatiable curiosity. At the heart of the row is an amazing illusion they both perform during their stage acts.

Q7291925,"With his vivid, stylized prose, cyberpunk intensity, and seemingly limitless imagination, Jack Womack has been compared to both William Gibson and Kurt Vonnegut - though Gibson admits, ""If you dropped the characters from Neuromancer into Womack's Manhattan, they'd fall down screaming and have nervous breakdowns"". Random Acts of Senseless Violence, Womack's fifth novel, is a thrilling, hysterical, and eerily disturbing piece ot work. 

Lola Hart is an ordinary twelve-year-old girl. She comes from a comfortable family, attends an exclusive private school, loves her friends Lori and Katherine, teases her sister Boob. But in the increasingly troubled city where she lives (a near-future Manhattan) she is a dying breed. Riots, fire, TB outbreaks, roaming gangs, increasing inflation, political and civil unrest all threaten her way of life, as well as the very fabric of New York City. 

In her diary, Lola chronicles the changes she and her family make as they attempt to adjust to a city, and a country, that is spinning out of control. Her mother is a teacher, but no one is hiring. Her father is a writer, but no one is buying his scripts. Hounded by creditors and forced to vacate their apartment and move to Harlem, her family, and her life, begins to dissolve. Increasingly estranged from her privileged school friends, Lola soon makes new ones: Iz, Jude, and Weezie - wise veterans of the street who know what must be done in order to survive and are more than willing to do it. And the metamorphosis of Lola Hart, who is surrounded by the new language and violence of the streets, begins. 

Simultaneously chilling and darkly hilarious, Random Acts of Senseless Violence takes the jittery urban fears we suppress, both in fiction and in daily life, and makes them explicit - and explicitly terrifying."

Q963586,"With the incomparable vision and breathtaking detail that brought his now-classic Marstrilogy to vivid life, bestselling author KIM STANLEY ROBINSON boldly imagines an alternate history of the last seven hundred years. In his grandest work yet, the acclaimed storyteller constructs a world vastly different from the one we know....The Years of Rice and SaltIt is the fourteenth century and one of the most apocalyptic events in human history is set to occur--the coming of the Black Death. History teaches us that a third of Europe's population was destroyed. But what if? What if the plague killed 99 percent of the population instead? How would the world have changed? This is a look at the history that could have been--a history that stretches across centuries, a history that sees dynasties and nations rise and crumble, a history that spans horrible famine and magnificent innovation. These are the years of rice and salt. This is a universe where the first ship to reach the New World travels across the Pacific Ocean from China and colonization spreads from west to east. This is a universe where the Industrial Revolution is triggered by the world's greatest scientific minds--in India. This is a universe where Buddhism and Islam are the most influential and practiced religions and Christianity is merely a historical footnote. Through the eyes of soldiers and kings, explorers and philosophers, slaves and scholars, Robinson renders an immensely rich tapestry. Rewriting history and probing the most profound questions as only he can, Robinson shines his extraordinary light on the place of religion, culture, power, and even love on such an Earth. From the steppes of Asia to the shores of the Western Hemisphere, from the age of Akbar to the present and beyond, here is the stunning story of the creation of a new world.From the Hardcover edition."

Q62113879,"From the Hugo Award­­–winning author of The Stars Are Legion comes a brand-new science fiction thriller about a futuristic war during which soldiers are broken down into light in order to get them to the front lines on Mars.

They said the war would turn us into light.
I wanted to be counted among the heroes who gave us this better world.

The Light Brigade: it’s what soldiers fighting the war against Mars call the ones who come back…different. Grunts in the corporate corps get busted down into light to travel to and from interplanetary battlefronts. Everyone is changed by what the corps must do in order to break them down into light. Those who survive learn to stick to the mission brief—no matter what actually happens during combat.

Dietz, a fresh recruit in the infantry, begins to experience combat drops that don’t sync up with the platoon’s. And Dietz’s bad drops tell a story of the war that’s not at all what the corporate brass want the soldiers to think is going on.

Is Dietz really experiencing the war differently, or is it combat madness? Trying to untangle memory from mission brief and survive with sanity intact, Dietz is ready to become a hero—or maybe a villain; in war it’s hard to tell the difference.

A worthy successor to classic stories like Downbelow Station, Starship Troopers, and The Forever War, The Light Brigade is award-winning author Kameron Hurley’s gritty time-bending take on the future of war."

Q6725637,"Throughout history, man has been searching for better ways to gather information about his universe. But although they may have longed for it, not even the most brilliant minds could conceive of a device as infinitely powerful or as immeasurably precise as the macroscope, until the twenty-first century. By analyzing information carried on macrons, this unbelievable tool brought the whole universe of wonders to man's doorstep. The macroscope was seen by many as the salvation of the human race.

It is the electrifying story of a psychologist who has devoted her life to tracking death. But when she volunteers for a research project that simulates the near-death experience, she will either solve life's greatest mystery -- or fall victim to its greatest terror. At Mercy General Hospital, Dr. Joanna Lander will soon be paged -- not to save a life, but to interview a patient just back from the dead. A psychologist specializing in near-death experiences, Joanna has spent two years recording the experiences of those who have been declared clinically dead and lived to tell about it. It's research on the fringes of ordinary science, but Joanna is about to get a boost from an unexpected quarter. A new doctor has arrived at Mercy General, one with the power to give Joanna the chance to get as close to death as anyone can.A brilliant young neurologist, Dr. Richard Wright has come up with a way to manufacture the near-death experience using a psychoactive drug. Dr. Wright is convinced that the NDE is a survival mechanism and that if only doctors understood how it worked, they could someday delay the dying process, or maybe even reverse it. He can use the expertise of a psychologist of Joanna Lander's standing to lend credibility to his study. But he soon needs Joanna for more than just her reputation. When his key volunteer suddenly drops out of the study, Joanna finds herself offering to become Richard's next subject. After all, who better than she, a trained psychologist, to document the experience? Her first NDE is as fascinating as she imagined it would be -- so astounding that she knows she must go back, if only to find out why this place is so hauntingly familiar. But each time Joanna goes under, her sense of dread begins to grow, because part of her already knows why the experience is so familiar, and why she has every reason to be afraid....And just when you think you know where she is going, Willis throws in the biggest surprise of all -- a shattering scenario that will keep you feverishly reading until the final climactic page is turned.From the Hardcover edition."

Q122452552,"*Shades of Milk and Honey* is an intimate portrait of Jane Ellsworth, a woman ahead of her time in a version of Regency England where the manipulation of glamour is considered an essential skill for a lady of quality. Despite the prevalence of magic in everyday life, other aspects of Dorchester's society are not that different: Jane and her sister Melody's lives still revolve around vying for the attentions of eligible men.

Jane resists this fate, and rightly so, because while her skill with glamour is remarkable, it is her sister who is fair of face, and therefore wins the lion's share of the attention. At the ripe old age of twenty-eight, Jane has resigned herself to being invisible forever. But when her family's honor is threatened, she finds that she must push her skills to the limit in order to set things right--and, in the process, accidentally wanders into a love story of her own.

This debut novel from an award-winning talent scratches a literary itch you never knew you had. Like wandering into a secret picnic attended by *Pride and Prejudice* and *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell*, *Shades of Milk and Honey* is precisely the sort of tale we would expect from Jane Austen...if she lived in a world where magic worked.

Q2294155,"""His best book,"" Esquire wrote of Kurt Vonnegut's 1959 novel The Sirens of Titan, adding, ""he dares not only to ask the ultimate question about the meaning of life, but to answer it.""  This novel fits into that aspect of the Vonnegut canon that might be classified as science fiction, a quality that once led Time to describe Vonnegut as ""George Orwell, Dr. Caligari and Flash Gordon compounded into one writer ... a zany but moral mad scientist.""

The Sirens of Titan was perhaps the novel that began the Vonnegut phenomenon with readers. The story is a fabulous trip, spinning madly through space and time in pursuit of nothing less than a fundamental understanding of the meaning of life. It takes place at a time in the future, when ""only the human soul remained terra incognita ... the Nightmare Ages, falling roughly, give or take a few years, between the Second World War and the Third Great Depression.""

The villainous and super rich Malachi Constant is offered a chance to journey into the far reaches of outer space, to eventually live on the planet Titan surrounded by three beautiful sirens. There is the proverbial ""small print"" with this incredible offer, which Constant turns down, setting in motion a fantastic chain of events that only Vonnegut could imagine. The result is an uproarious, freewheeling inquiry into the very reason we exist and about how we participate and matter in the scheme of the universe.

The Sirens of Titan is essential, fundamental Vonnegut, as entertaining as it is questing in search of answers to the mysteries of life.  As a work of fiction, it is a sure leap, in terms of craft, over his first novel, Player Piano. His writing here is pared down, more concentrated and graceful, richly in the service of his remarkable ideas. Vonnegut summons greatness for the first time in The Sirens of Titan, where the search for the meaning of existence looks and sounds like a kaleidoscopic dream but leaves the reader with a clear and challenging answer."

Q1339232,"John Scalzi channels Robert Heinlein (including a wry sense of humor) in a novel about a future Earth engaged in an interstellar war against more advanced species.  Citizens volunteer for the Colonial Defense Forces after retirement, in exchange for which they have their consciousness transferred into a young body, cloned from their DNA but enhanced.  If, against the odds, they survive two years of combat (or 10 years if things aren't going well, which they're not), they get another body and enjoy a fresh start on a colony.  This is Scalzi's first novel, and it creates a future he will revisit in subsequent stories.

John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife’s grave. Then he joined the army. The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce—and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding. Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity’s resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don’t want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You’ll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You’ll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you’ll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets. John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine—and what he will become is far stranger."
Q6749555,"Stephen Baxter's Manifold novels have struck the world of science fiction like a meteor. Heralded by Arthur Clark as ""a major new talent,"" Baxter stands time and space on their collective heads, envisions the future reflected in the past, and the past in the galaxy's most distant reaches and unformed speculations. Claiming the legacy of Heinlein and Asimov, Baxter now returns with his third Manifold novel--in which he uses an astounding adventure story to posit a breathtaking vision of the origin of species . . . on earth and beyond.In the year 2015 a red moon appears in the Earth's orbit: brooding, multitextured, beautiful, and alive. Catastrophe follows. While coastlands flood by the new gravitational forces, millions of people die. Scientists scramble desperately to understand what is on the big red moon and how it got there. And NASA astronaut Reid Malenfant, and his wife Emma, are hurtling through the African sky in a training jet, when everything changes forever.For Malenfant and Emma, a reckless flight in a T-38 above the sun-baked continent sends them colliding with a great wheel in the sky. Now Emma has awakened in a strange, Earthlike world, among physically powerful, primitive creatures who share humankind's features and desires but lack the human mind. And Reid Malenfant is back in Texas, reliving the plane crash, looking up at the red moon, and knowing in his heart that Emma is there.Emma is there, beginning a journey of survival that is both horrific and fascinating, utterly familiar and totally beyond comprehension. Malenfant, teamed with a Japanese scientist named Nemoto, will get his chance to rescue his wife. But neither can foresee the extraordinary adventures that await them. Neither can imagine the small and immense evolutionary secrets cloaked in the atmosphere of the red moon, or guess at how a vast, living, tightly woven cosmos has shaped our planet as we know it--and how it will shape it again.From the Hardcover edition.

Q106259289,"With no water, no air, and no native life, the planet Gora is unremarkable. The only thing it has going for it is a chance proximity to more popular worlds, making it a decent stopover for ships traveling between the wormholes that keep the Galactic Commons connected. If deep space is a highway, Gora is just your average truck stop.

At the Five-Hop One-Stop, long-haul spacers can stretch their legs (if they have legs, that is), and get fuel, transit permits, and assorted supplies.

Q492207,"Starship Troopers takes place in the midst of an interstellar war between the Terran Federation of Earth and the Arachnids (referred to as ""The Bugs"") of Klendathu. It is narrated as a series of flashbacks by Juan Rico, and is one of only a few Heinlein novels set out in this fashion.  The novel opens with Rico aboard the corvette  Rodger Young, about to embark on a raid against the planet of the ""Skinnies,"" who are allies of the Arachnids. We learn that he is a cap(sule) trooper in the Terran Federation's Mobile Infantry. The raid itself, one of the few instances of actual combat in the novel, is relatively brief: the Mobile Infantry land on the planet, destroy their targets, and retreat, suffering a single casualty in the process.

The story then flashes back to Rico's graduation from high school, and his decision to sign up for Federal Service over the objections of his father. This is the only chapter that describes Rico's civilian life, and most of it is spent on the monologues of two people: retired Lt. Col. Jean V. Dubois, Rico's school instructor in ""History and Moral Philosophy,"" and Fleet Sergeant Ho, a recruiter for the armed forces of the Terran Federation.

Dubois serves as a stand-in for Heinlein throughout the novel, and delivers what is probably the book's most famous soliloquy on violence, and how it ""has settled more issues in history than has any other factor."" Fleet Sergeant Ho's monologues examine the nature of military service, and his anti-military tirades appear in the book primarily as a contrast with Dubois. (It is later revealed that his rants are calculated to scare off the weaker applicants).

Interspersed throughout the book are other flashbacks to Rico's high school History and Moral Philosophy course, which describe how in the Terran Federation of Rico's day, the rights of a full Citizen (to vote, and hold public office) must be earned through some form of volunteer Federal service. Those residents who have not exercised their right to perform this Federal Service retain the other rights generally associated with a modern democracy (free speech, assembly, etc.), but they cannot vote or hold public office. This structure arose ad hoc after the collapse of the 20th century Western democracies, brought on by both social failures at home and military defeat by the Chinese Hegemony overseas (assumed looking forward into the late 20th century from the time the novel was written in the late 1950s).

In the next section of the novel Rico goes to boot camp at Camp Arthur Currie, on the northern prairies. Five chapters are spent exploring Rico's experience entering the service under the training of his instructor, Career Ship's Sergeant Charles Zim. Camp Currie is so rigorous that less than ten percent of the recruits finish basic training; the rest either resign, are expelled, or die in training. One of the chapters deals with Ted Hendrick, a fellow recruit and constant complainer who is flogged and expelled for striking a superior officer. Another recruit, a deserter who committed a heinous crime while AWOL, is hanged by his battalion. Rico himself is flogged for poor handling of (simulated) nuclear weapons during a drill; despite these experiences he eventually graduates and is assigned to a unit.

At some point during Rico's training, the 'Bug War' has begun to brew, and Rico finds himself taking part in combat operations. The war ""officially"" starts with an Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of Buenos Aires, although Rico makes it clear that prior to the attack there were plenty of ""'incidents,' 'patrols,' or 'police actions.'"" Rico briefly describes the Terran Federation's loss at the Battle of Klendathu where his unit is decimated and his ship destroyed. Following Klendathu, the Terran Federation is reduced to making hit-and-run raids similar to the one described at the beginning of the novel (which, chronologically would be placed between Chapters 10 and 11). Rico meanwhile finds himself posted to Rasczak's Roughnecks, named after Lieutenant Rasczak (his first name is never given). This part of the book focuses on the daily routine of military life, as well as the relationship between officers and non-commissioned officers, personified in this case by Rasczak and Sergeant Jelal.

Eventually, Rico decides to become a career soldier and attends Officer Candidate School, which turns out to be just like boot camp, only ""squared and cubed with books added.""[15] Rico is commissioned a temporary Third Lieutenant as a field-test final exam and commands his own unit during Operation Royalty; eventually he graduates as a Second Lieutenant and full-fledged officer.

The final chapter serves as more of a coda, depicting Rico aboard the Rodger Young as the lieutenant in command of Rico's Roughnecks, preparing to drop to Klendathu as part of a major strike, with his father (having joined the Service earlier in the novel) as his senior sergeant and a Third Lieutenant-in-training of his own under his wing."

Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.

Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.

A groundbreaking work from a master, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark."

Q1758811,"The Plot Against America is a novel by Philip Roth published in 2004. It is an alternative history in which Franklin D. Roosevelt is defeated in the presidential election of 1940 by Charles Lindbergh. The novel follows the fortunes of the Roth family during the Lindbergh presidency, as antisemitism becomes more accepted in American life and Jewish-American families like the Roths are persecuted on various levels. The narrator and central character in the novel is the young Philip, and the care with which his confusion and terror are rendered makes the novel as much about the mysteries of growing up as about American politics. Roth based his novel on the isolationist ideas espoused by Lindbergh in real life as a spokesman for the America First Committee, and on his own experiences growing up in Newark, New Jersey. The novel received praise for the realism of its world and its treatment of topics such as antisemitism, trauma, and the perception of history. The novel depicts the Weequahic section of Newark which includes Weequahic High School from which Roth graduated.

In 2005, the novel won the James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Best Historical Fiction given by the Society of American Historians. It won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History, was a finalist for the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, and came in 11th for the 2005 Locus Awards."

 This is a sci fi story about a Terran (Earth) 
crew of neo-dolphins and humans on the starship “The Streaker”.  
Their mission is to find information about the first Galactic 
race, which existed billions of yeas ago. The neo-dolphins are 
dolphins which have gone through the ""Uplift"" process, which 
creates through genetic engineering  more intelligent sentient 
beings. For the neo-dolphins, this is also a test of their ability 
to apply their intelligence, knowledge and skills  to Galactic 
space travel and exploration. 
The Terrans find an ancient fleet of starships, and on a nearby 
planet, an ancient (human?) skeleton.  There are other Galactic 
races, who are also keen to find information about the first 
Galactic civilization.   Their  hot pursuit of the Terrans forces 
“The Streaker” to land on the planet Kithrup, whose watery 
environment and atmosphere are similar to Earth. Above the planet, 
the starships of the other Galactic races fight each other.  
On Kithrup, the dolphins and humans begin repairs to the Streaker, 
and to explore the ocean, and the inland area of their landing 
site.  They discover an aboriginal species living amongst the 
trees and lakes inland. There is evidence that there has 
been another Galactic race on the planet in the very distant past. 

Within the crew of the Streaker, tensions and conflicts develop on 
how to escape from Kithrup. The story centers on individual human

Q1968531,"Poul Anderson's Tau Zero is an outstanding work of science fiction, in part because it combines two qualities that are often at odds in this genre: an interest in the emotional lives of its characters and a fascination with all things technological and scientific.  In Tau Zero these components are not merely fused; they work together with a remarkable synergy that makes the novel much more than just a deep space adventure story.The novel centers on a ten-year interstellar voyage aboard the spaceship Leonora Christine, and it opens with members of the crew preparing for their departure from earth.  It is an especially moving departure because they know that while they are aboard the ship and traveling close to the speed of light, time will be passing much more quickly back home.  As a result, by the time they return everyone they know will have long since died.  From practically the very first page, therefore, Tau Zero sets the scientific realities of space travel in dramatic tension with the no-less-real emotional and psychological states of the travelers.  This is a dynamic Anderson explores with great success over the course of the novel as fifty crewmembers settle in for the long journey together.  They are a highly-trained team of  scientists and researchers, but they are also a community of individuals, each trying to make a life for him or herself in space.This is the background within which the action of the novel takes place.  Anderson carefully depicts the network of relationships linking these people before the real plot begins to unfold.   The voyage soon takes a unexpected and disastrous turn for the worse.  The ship passes through a small, uncharted, cloudlike nebula that makes it impossible for the crew to decelerate the ship.  The only hope, in fact, is for the ship to speed up.  But acceleration towards the speed of light means that time outside the spaceship passes even more quickly, and the crew finds itself hurtling deeper into space and further into the future.  Anderson's experience as a physicist is evidenced in the knowledgeable way he discusses the technical details of space and time travel, although his explanations never become burdensome or tedious.  More to the point,  the painstaking care with which he has drawn the characters ensures that the action is both imaginatively compelling and emotionally meaningful.  It is a combination that is unfortunately all too rare in science fiction."

Havyrl, Vyrl, Lionstar is a prince of the titular Ruby Dynasty who comes to Balimul as part of a governmental plan to deal with the aftermath of an interstellar war. Masked and enigmatic, he has a reputation as a monster with Kamoj's people.

Vyrl interferes with Kamoj's culture and destabilizes their government by pushing her into marriage with himself. Themes surrounding the physical and emotional scars left on the survivors of a war with no clear victor are prevalent throughout this storyline. As such, it is also a story of healing for the characters Kamoj and Lionstar.

The book is divided into two parts, the ""home"", and the ""castle"". The ending is part of the ""home"" section, returning after the castle.

The story is based around the German fairy tale of 
Briar Rose
 (
Sleeping Beauty
) which is told by ""Gemma"", an elderly woman, to her three granddaughters. She tells this to the children almost all the time and it is the only bedtime story she ever tells. The times when ""Gemma"" tells the story are flashbacks and alternate between the present-day story.

In the present day, Gemma's 
Jewish
 family is living somewhere outside a city in 
Massachusetts
. After her grandmother's death, Rebecca Berlin, the youngest of her three granddaughters (referred to as Becca in the novel) begins to believe that there is some meaning behind the bedtime story that her grandmother told to them hundreds of times. She consults Stan, a good friend and journalist who works for an ""alternative"" newspaper and uncovers historical facts.

She discovers that her grandmother was actually a survivor of the 
Holocaust
 who was persecuted for her Jewish origins, and sent to 
Chełmno extermination camp
 to be executed. She decides to visit Chełmno and discovers a link with a man by the name of Josef Potocki in Poland. Becca sets off for Poland to find the identity and the life of her grandmother.



The Castle - Josef's story
[
edit
]


In Poland, Josef tells his life story and his meeting with Gemma. In the book, his story is told in the ""castle"" section. He was a target of the 
Holocaust
 due to his homosexuality, and became a fugitive, during which time he met many different people, mainly partisans, mainly in Germany. He had heard stories of torture and extermination camps and joined an underground group set out to rescue victims. This leads him to Chełmno (called 
Kulmhof
 by the Germans), where he witnesses the gassing to death of numerous people. The people are brought to the camp and then packed into trucks. The trucks drive away, with their exhaust funnelled into the passenger hold. By the time the trucks arrive at their destination, a mass grave, all of the people it was carrying have been gassed to death by the truck exhaust. The people are then dumped into the grave. When the bodies are dumped one of the partisans, named The Avenger notices that a woman with red hair (Gemma) is still alive and faintly breathing. Josef revives her through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, which the woman, (who is later called KSIĘŻNICZKA, which means 'princess' in Polish) refers to in her fairy tale as ""the kiss of life"". In reality, during this period of time, 320,000 were killed in Chelmno via the method of gassing them in trucks.

Later, she hid in the forest with Polish partisans, fighting the Nazis, and married The Avenger, whom Josef was also in love with. She became pregnant by him shortly after their marriage. Then he, along with almost all of the other partisans, was killed by the Nazis. She escaped and was brought safely to the United States. She never told a soul about these experiences, rather dealing with the trauma by refashioning them in her mind into the form of a familiar fairytale about an evil witch, a princess rendered unconscious who is then revived by a handsome prince, and a happy ending.

Birthright
 spans a timeline of nearly 17 millennia, beginning at a very early stage of expansion from Earth and ending with the death of the last humans. In between, it chronicles a slow but (despite some set-backs) steady conquest of the entire 
galaxy
 - inhabited by thousands of sentient alien races, which are overpowered and oppressed using whatever tool it takes: economic pressure, diplomatic finesse, or simple military power.

Not all chapters deal with humanity's treatment of aliens; some also cover the ""internal"" politics that result in a development of the growing human empire from a democracy to a monarchy. But the biggest theme is undeniably the search for the elusive quality that allows humanity to overcome all opposition and manage the unique feat of conquering the entire galaxy. It is never clearly defined but manifests perhaps most succinctly when it also results in the failure of an attempt to cross the void between galaxies.

Then, after there is no more room for conquest, the only way left is down: internal struggles as well as deep-seated resentment of aliens result in a decline of human power that takes nearly as long as the rise, but is described far less extensively. Somehow, despite whatever enabled humans to achieve total power, they were unable to keep it.

One of the chapters reveals the ""literary genre of fiction"" as another of humanity's peculiarities, not shared by any alien race."

In this novel, DryCo is facing problems from a mass religious movement centered on the premise that 
Elvis Presley
 was a semi divine figure, who performed 
miracles
 for believers in his sect. It decides to resolve this problem by retrieving a younger 
alternate history
 Elvis, and bringing him to present day New New York to discredit the posthumous reputation and mythology that now surrounds Elvis.

The retrieval team are a married couple, Iz and John. Iz is actually an 
African American
, although cosmetic surgery has led to an uncomfortable masquerade as a ""
Caucasian
"" woman in the chosen alternate history. It turns out to be that of 
Terraplane
, the previous novel in the DryCo quartet, where 
Abraham Lincoln
 was 
prematurely assassinated
 in early 1861, the 
American Civil War
 never took place, and 
slavery
 was only abolished by 
Theodore Roosevelt
 in 1907. Therefore, this world is backward when it comes to the 
civil rights movement
 and racist segregation is still widespread there.

In 
Terraplane
 (1989), it was hinted that the assassination of 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
 by 
Giuseppe Zangara
 in 1933, 
Winston Churchill
's death in a car accident in 1931, and the abduction of 
Joseph Stalin
 would lead to a 
Nazi
 victory in its 
World War II
. However, this envisaged outcome did not transpire. Instead, 
Leon Trotsky
 takes advantage of the power vacuum in the post-Stalinist Soviet Union, returns from exile in 
Mexico
, and assumes power in his stead. Therefore, there is still a 
Nazi
-
Soviet
 Pact, but 
Operation Barbarossa
 does not occur because the USSR rearms to the same extent as Nazi Germany. Moreover, Trotsky declares war on Nazi Germany before it can launch Barbarossa to its east and betray the Nazi-Soviet Pact in 1941. In the 
Pacific theater
, the United States defeats 
Japan
 in 1946, but they do so through dropping fourteen atomic bombs on the Home Islands, which reduces the nation to an irradiated wasteland. Meanwhile, 
Hitler
 is assassinated in 1944, and the new Chancellor 
Albert Speer
 signs an armistice with the 
United Kingdom
, the United States and the Soviet Union, which leads to an unstable multi polar world due to the inconclusive result of World War II in this world.

In its 1954, the alternate Elvis turns out to be a 
sexual predator
 who has already murdered Gladys Presley when John and Iz encounter him for the first time. He then tries to rape Iz, much to John's anger, and displays symptoms of 
psychosis
 and latent 
schizophrenia
. His poor mental health is not assisted by his strong religious beliefs and an unexpectedly early 
divergence point
 in this world's past, where 
Valentinian
 
gnosticism
 survived and became the dominant belief system in this alternate 
Southern United States
 instead of 
evangelical Christianity
. This was noted in passing in 
Terraplane
, with mention of an 
Albigensian
 Bible and a 
Valentinian
 House of God as background detail, alerting aware readers to the survival of 
Gnosticism
 in this timeline.

The 
dualist
 religious philosophy of this belief framework worsens Elvis' mental illness; as a 
Valentinian
 
gnostic
, his core religious beliefs are not based on 
messianic
 criteria as  are those of orthodox 
Christianity
, and he is horrified at the demand of DryCo that he become a virtual 
messiah
 that they can use to manipulate the Elvisian faith. He comprehends this as prompting that he become an instrument of the 
demiurge
, the evil and flawed creator of the material world in his 
gnostic
 
world view
. Due to this psychological pressure, his psychosis escalates after he is transferred to Dryco's homeworld. However, his masquerade collides with scepticism at a 
London
 ""ElCon"" (Elvis Convention) religious gathering and there is a riot. Iz, John and Elvis use bootleg DryCo time travel technology to travel back to London in the alternate world's forties and Elvis loses himself amidst the debris of 
St Paul's Cathedral

However, Elvis is relatively psychologically healthy and morally sane compared to the intense anti-human pathology of DryCo's world; in the end he risks everything to escape it.

DryCo's plan has failed. Although John and Iz are sacked from DryCo Central, DryCo Europe offers Iz a position within their local hierarchy. John commits suicide in the bath, and is persuaded by Iz (frightened for her own life, and that of her fetus) that she intends to join him moments later; she does not. Dying, John becomes aware that she deceived him and intends to remain behind and continue living during his last cognizant moment. He communicates non-verbally that he understands, although whether he believes in the end that the child is his own is unclear. Iz has survived, but at great personal cost."

Corrupting Dr. Nice
 is set mainly in three eras: the twenty-first century, 40 AD and the Cretaceous Period. In 2063 AD, time travel is commonplace. Time travelers feel free to exploit the past without fear of changing their own history because each visit creates an 
alternate history
 called a ""moment universe"". The Saltimbanque Corporation uses it for tourism and to exploit the resources of the past. Famous historical figures are snatched from their time and brought to the twenty-first century (these include 
Amadeus Mozart
, 
Sigmund Freud
, Abraham Lincoln, and Jesus Christ from several different times in his life).

 After visitors leave a moment universe, it continues with its new history. In a few of them, permanent installations are created that can be revisited and used as way stations for time travel. One is set up in the Jerusalem of 40 AD, complete with hotels.

The story begins in the Cretaceous where Dr. Owen Vannice, heir to an enormous fortune and the Dr. Nice of the title, is working as an amateur 
paleontologist
. Vannice arranges to transport Wilma, a baby 
Apatosaurus
, to his home. Sabotage of the time travel apparatus strands him for a time in 40 AD and brings him in contact with a couple of con artists, Genevieve Faison and her father August. At first, the duo conspire to steal the dinosaur from Owen. However, during an abortive attempt by 
Zealots
 to take over the time travel station, Genevieve falls in love with him. Before she can confess to him that she is a con artist, Owen finds out from a third party and leaves in disgust.

Broken-hearted, but aware that she is much cleverer than Owen, Genevieve plots an elaborate revenge. Posing as Emma Zume of the Committee to Protect the Past, she arranges to visit his estate and inspect his dinosaur. She makes no attempt to disguise herself, simply altering her personality; and Owen falls in love with her because she reminds him of Genevieve. However, after they are married she pulls a series of surprises on him. She reminds him that she is a ""sexual deliberationist"", which turns out to mean that she believes in not having sex. She also reveals that she has conspired with her parents to 
retrieve a sperm sample from him
 so a grandchild can be grown in an 
artificial womb
; and that his father has managed to 
clone
 Wilma for use in an exotic food industry. Feeling betrayed, he files for divorce. He also realizes that he is really in love with Genevieve, who he still fails to realize is also Emma. Having had her revenge, Genevieve discovers that it gives her little satisfaction, and she decides to go after him. Meeting in Jerusalem, they are happily reconciled.

In a parallel story line, 
Simon the Zealot
, one of the 
apostles
, is arrested for his role in the attempted takeover of the time travel station. He is embittered by the changes in Jerusalem and by the removal of Jesus to the future. Early in the occupation by the time travelers, his wife Alma took ill and died; and he is estranged from his son Samuel, who sings a variation of twentieth century blues in clubs. While awaiting trial in 2063 AD, he learns about the future society that he hates and becomes skilled in manipulating public opinion. The trial is presided over by an 
artificial intelligence
 that keeps a running tally of public opinion and factors it into its verdict. Owen makes a disastrous attempt at helping Simon. Abraham Lincoln appears for the prosecution, but Simon counters with a surprise appearance by the Jesus who was extracted from his moment universe. Jesus makes a speech that moves public opinion in favor of Simon. He is acquitted, and in Jerusalem is reunited with Alma after Owen extracts her from another moment universe.

The novel begins with Chase Insteadman, a former child actor whose career seems to be over, accidentally meeting Perkus Tooth, a once-promising critic now barely surviving by writing liner notes for CDs and DVDs at the office space of 
The Criterion Collection
, and Perkus is eager to expose Chase to a self-contained universe of pop culture esoterica. Perkus has unconventional opinions on almost everything, especially 
Marlon Brando
, and is glad to express them; Chase contents himself with listening to his new friend. Much of the first part of the novel is pivoted upon Perkus' speeches and Chase's thoughts about them. In this part of the novel readers also meet Perkus' friends: Oona Laszlo, a ghost-writer of autobiographies, and presently that of high-profile sculptor Laird Noteless, whose ""dystopian"" public art exhibits are hinted to actually be disaster sites; Richard Abneg, a former squatter, now working for the powerful NYC mayor, Jules Arnheim (who seems to be a fictional portrait of 
Michael Bloomberg
); Biller, a black hobo who unexpectedly turns Internet wizard; and Georgina Hawkmanaji, often referred to as the ostrich-woman, a 
Turk
 heiress to ""twenty million or so of inherited 
Armenian plunder
.""

Strange things happen in the NYC depicted in the novel; a mysterious tiger randomly destroys buildings and underground stations; a grey fog envelops Manhattan's Downtown; people are fascinated by mysterious chaldrons, gorgeous vases that are only seen in pictures, because nobody seems to have ever seen the originals; people keep asking Chase about his fiancée, Janice Trumbull, stranded on the orbital space station, even though he cannot remember anything of the woman but her letters. On the other hand, nothing really important seems to happen in the plot, with the characters living their ordinary lives, unconventional as they may be. But then the tiger strikes Perkus' favorite hamburger joint, and damages the building he lives in; this suddenly turns him into a hobo, and sets in motion a chain of events which will bring the novel to its conclusion—and to several final revelations."

Fourth Mansions
 was inspired by 
Teresa of Ávila
's 
Interior Castle
, and contains quotations from the book, which Lafferty uses as chapter headings. The Interior Castle is a metaphor for an individual's soul; its different rooms, different states of the soul. In the middle of the Castle the soul is in the purest state, which equals Heaven. Lafferty uses more complex symbols in telling a many-sided tale of an individual's reaching towards Heaven or Truth.
The novel concerns a time of great change, when four forces – in the form of secret societies – contend to control the next phase of humanity's history. In the middle is Fred Foley, an innocent reporter. One of these forces intends to unleash a deadly virus on the US, the others attempt to stop them. A revolution by Mexican migrants, the craft of ""mind weaving"" and a strange group of ""Patricks"", all apparently tramps but with great resources, appear in the center of a narrative.

A man wakes up from a dream-like state, naked and freezing, with no memory. A little girl leads him through a series of corridors in a generation ship in search of warmth. She calls him Teacher, and together they encounter several other strange beings as they travel through the ship trying to survive and find the answers to their questions.

Teacher eventually finds out that he is a clone and has been resurrected several times before, although those versions did not survive. Each clone was able to leave bits of information, a kind of breadcrumb trail for the next iteration. It is from these diaries that Teacher discovers the true nature of his situation. His companions are clones as well, genetically engineered for specific purposes.

The ship's crew has separated into two groups, each vying for control of the ship. One faction wants to abandon their mission to colonize a planet which is already teeming with life, while the other wants to press forward. The ship is damaged during one of their battles, and the clones have been created in order to fix it.

Teacher, who discovers his real name is Sanjay, eventually reaches the third hull of the book's title where he encounters Mother, who is the leader of the faction that wants to continue to their destination. She tells him she created him to be her ally. In the end, Teacher and his companions flee from Mother and await their arrival on the new planet.

The novel centers on Charles Yu, a 
time machine
 mechanic. He lives in his TM-31 time machine with his non-existent dog, Ed, and the time machine's depressed computer, TAMMY. Yu travels through Minor Universe 31 fixing time machines of people who try to fix the past. He visits Linus Skywalker who tried to kill his father, 
Luke Skywalker
 because his father's fame overshadowed Linus's life. Yu also visits a girl who traveled to be with her grandmother as she died. Yu explains to her that because she wasn't present when it happened, she cannot stay.

Yu is called in by his boss, Phil, to have his time machine serviced. He walks around in the city while his TM-31 is being repaired and visits his mother who is in a time loop in which she continually replays an hour of her life. He watches a holographic version of himself and his mother interact as she serves dinner.

The next day Yu rushes back to his time machine, sees his future self exit his machine, and shoots his future self. As his future self is dying, the future self gives Yu a book and says that the book is the key. By shooting himself, Yu has entered a loop in which he must eventually travel back in time, hand his past self the book, and get shot.

Yu quickly takes off in his time machine and begins to rewrite the book by reading from the book he was handed. He eventually asks himself what would happen if he skipped forward, and so he jumps to the end of the book.

He wakes up in a Buddhist temple and sees ""The Woman My Mother Should Have Been"" as well as his father's shoes. He exits the temple and finds himself in a shuttle.

Yu finds himself back in his TM-31 and floats through memories that he sees play out before him. He explains how he and his father invented the time machine and brought it to the director of research at the Institute of Conceptual Technology. Yu's father explained the concepts but was unable to get his machine to work.

Back in the TM-31, Yu finds a key in the book he is writing that leads him to discover a diorama with a clock that points to a time. TAMMY and Yu realize that this is a clue to where they can find Yu's father, but also realize that they are headed back to the hangar so Yu's past self can shoot him.

Yu realizes as he flies in that he loves TAMMY and she loves him. He steps out of his time machine and gets shot, but lives as it was just a shot to his stomach.

In the appendix, Yu talks about visiting the place and time displayed by the diorama. He finds his father, trapped because his time machine broke down. Yu makes amends with his father and then travels to the present. He reunites his parents, then sets off to find ""The Woman You Never Married"". He continues to write his novel, but suggests he ""keep stalling, see how long you can keep expanding the infinitely expandable moment""."

The book begins with a brief history of the Lands of Vin. It is narrated by a Washer, or preacher, of the Collegium, the main religious body. Nearly fifteen hundred years before the events that take place in Flesh and Fire, the Lands of Vin were ruled by arrogant prince-mages, who derived their power from spellwine. To put an end to the prince-mages' tyranny, Zatim, a demigod more commonly referred to as ""Sin Washer"", drastically reduced the 
magic
 contained in the spellgrapes used to make spellwine.

The prelude of the book describes a mutant grub infestation Master Vinart Sionio of Iaja discovers in his vineyards. The mutation is caused by magic, and could only have been created by another Vineart. The plot then comes to Jerzy, an adolescent slave owned by Master Vineart Malech of The Berengia. When Jerzy in entranced by the smell of crushed grapes during the harvest, Malech takes interest in Jerzy. Malech then tests Jerzy's ability to sense magic, and begins training Jerzy to become a Vineart.

During this time, the first of a series of strange events occur. First, an unusually large order of healwines is placed by the island kingdom of Atakus. Meanwhile, in Atakus, Prince Erebuh has just received a negotiator from a Vineart on the nearby island of Ekai concerning the loss of three ships carrying spellwine. This is highly unusual, as Atakus, a key port for ships, makes extensive use of spellwines to ensure fair weather. After Prince Erebuh gives the negotiator his reply, the prince's most trusted daughter, Thais, visits the negotiator, who kills her then commits suicide. Upon further investigation by Atakus's Master Vineart, Edon, it is discovered that the negotiator's actions were not his own, but under the influence of spellwine.

Malech continues teaching Jerzy the process in crafting spellwines. A few months into Jerzy's training, Malech's primary field becomes infested with rootglow, though it is out of season for the disease. The infestation is contained, but does significant damage to Malech's vines. Then a wagon sent to collect healwines for a nearby town is destroyed, with no apparent cause. Malech begins to send inquiries to other Vineart, and discovers they have also been seeing an unusual number of accidents.

In Aktakus, Prince Erebuh decides to completely isolate the island in a veil of fog, at the suggestion of Master Vineart Edon.

Cooper Shen, a member of the 
Cooperage
 Guild then brings Malech news of 
sea serpents
 sighted near Atakus, the first sighting in over seven generations. Two weeks later, a messenger from Prince Ranulf arrives, and tells Malech that a sea serpent has destroyed the entire town of Darcen. The messenger also brings a request for spellwines to cleanse the area contaminated by the sea serpent, and Malech sends Jerzy with the messenger to determine which spellwine will be necessary. When Jerzy reaches Prince Ranulf's encampment, the sea serpent resurfaces, but is quickly killed by spells which Prince Ranulf and Jerzy cast. Jerzy returns with pieces of the serpent, and Malech determines that it was created using magic.

Malech then sends Jerzy to study with Vineart Giordan of Aleppan, while secretly instructing Jerzy to find how much of the recent events has taken public interest. Giordan's dependence on the maiar of Aleppan is already under criticism from the Collegium, and when news of the exchange reaches Washers in Upper Altenne, they send Brother Darian to learn more about Jerzy.

Jerzy arrives in Aleppan by boat, and begins his training with Giordan.  Ao, a trader with the Eastern Wind Trading Clan, notices Jerzy's attempts to eavesdrop on the conversations of nobles, and offers to teach Jerzy how to be less conspicuous. Near Atakus, a Caulic ship attempts to locate the island, and determine the cause of its disappearance. The Caulic fleet also intends to capture Atakus's valuable ports.

Jerzy also comes in contact with the maiar's daughter, Mahault, who shares how her father has not been acting normally in the past year. The sentiment is echoed by others who Jerzy meets with access to the court. After Ao and Mahault take interest in Jerzy's attempts to collect information, Jerzy solicits Ao's help in finding useful gossip.

When Jerzy secretly tastes Giordan's grapes to determine if they were used to create the sea serpent, he is spotted by Brother Darian. Darian accuses Jerzy of break the Command, and apostasy, a crime punishable by death. During the trial, Giordan attempts to defer all blame to Jerzy, but the maiar and Darian are intent on finding Giordan guilty. Giordan panics, and attacks the guards. Mahault and Ao use the commotion to free Jerzy and the city."

Following the events of 
The Three Body Problem
, humanity unites to defend Earth against the invasion fleet of the alien planet Trisolaris, which will arrive in approximately 400 years. Earth's defence is severely hampered by Trisolaran ""sophons"", omnipresent but unobservable supercomputers that spy on all Earth activity and interfere with technological development.

However, as sophons cannot surveil human thought, the 
United Nations
 appoints four ""Wallfacers"": individuals tasked with developing defence strategies known only to themselves, and are provided near-unlimited power to do so. Three of the Wallfacers are renowned for their military, political and scientific expertise, but their secret strategies are ultimately exposed by Trisolaris' agents, the ""Wallbreakers"". 

The fourth Wallfacer is the obscure 
sociologist
 and ex-
astronomer
 Luo Ji who, despite being less qualified, is chosen because he is the target of the only assassination order ever issued by Trisolaris. Initially unsure why he is feared by Trisolaris, Luo eventually realizes it is because of a prior encounter with astrophysicist Ye Wenjie, who was the first human to establish contact with Trisolaris. Ye had encouraged Luo to develop 
a theory of ""cosmic sociology""
, the central claim of which is that a civilization which broadcasts its location to the universe will almost certainly invite its destruction by another civilization. Luo tests his hypothesis by broadcasting the location of a star 50 
light-years
 away, then entering 
hibernation
 while awaiting to see if the target star is destroyed, which it is by an unknown advanced civilization. The Trisolarans, realizing Luo has uncovered a way to destroy Trisolaris, send probes to jam any further cosmic broadcasts. 

200 years later, Luo is revived into a utopian society boasting advanced technology. However, the widespread belief in Earth's superiority is shattered when its entire space fleet is annihilated by a single Trisolaran probe. Assuming Earth is almost certain to lose the war, two surviving spaceships escape the 
Solar System
 to establish civilization elsewhere.

Amidst the ensuing panic on Earth, Luo resumes his Wallfacer role and dedicates his efforts on a seemingly ineffective defence strategy, which is actually a secret ruse to overcome the Trisolaran jamming of cosmic broadcasts. Threatening Trisolaris with 
mutual assured destruction
 should he broadcast Trisolaris' (and by proximity, Earth's) location, Luo forces Trisolaris to divert its invasion fleet and to aid human scientific progress.

Years later, Luo converses with a pacifist Trisolaran. They agree that it may be possible for galactic civilizations to engage in peaceful relations."

Kirth Gersen learns that his enemy Howard Alan Treesong, already ""Lord of the Overmen"" (i.e., head of the underworld across all of humanity's planets), nearly arranged to be appointed Chief of the Interworld Police Coordinating Commission, the sole interstellar police organization. Gersen ponders what Treesong could be working on that could top that.

Gersen's extensive business empire includes 
Cosmopolis
 magazine, and he often masquerades as a journalist, ""Henry Lucas"". Gersen examines old 
Cosmopolis
 files for anything about Treesong. He discovers a photograph, apparently of a formal dinner, bearing the words ""H A Treesong is here"", with no other information. He launches 
Extant
, a livelier sister magazine to 
Cosmopolis
, and publishes the picture in the free inaugural issue, offering large cash prizes for the identification of anyone in the photograph.

An attractive young woman, Alice Wroke, seeks temporary employment processing contest entries. Gersen confirms she is working for Treesong. Eventually, all of the subjects are identified, except for one man who goes by a variety of names. Gersen tells Alice that the contest was intended to identify Treesong, and that the magazine wants to interview him.

Gersen suspects the photograph depicts most of the highest-ranking Fellows of the powerful 
Institute
, seven members of the governing ""Dexad"" and three Fellows of rank 99. All but one were fatally poisoned at the banquet. The survivor must be Treesong. Having fraudulently acquired the rank of 99, he plans to become the Institute's leader, the Triune. Three of the Dexad were not present. One had died; the banquet was to choose his successor from the 99s. Another had broken with the Institute and become a hermit. The last was Alice's father; Treesong blackmailed Alice into spying for him by threatening to kill her father (whom he had already murdered).

Gersen saves the hermit from assassination, in the process shooting Treesong in the leg. The hermit, as the new Triune, cancels Treesong's spurious rank, foiling another plan to acquire a position of immense power.

Treesong's father enters the contest, identifying him as Howard Hardoah. His letter mentions a school reunion, to which Howard has been invited. Treesong himself calls 
Extant
, but is too late to claim a prize. ""Lucas"" offers to publish his memoirs, but he says he has an urgent rendezvous on a distant planet. Gersen suspects that he will attend the reunion.

Gersen visits and interviews the elder Hardoah. He also meets Howard's older brother Ledesmus, who hid Howard's prized ""Book of Dreams,"" an exercise book in which he wrote his childhood fantasies. Howard assaulted his only childhood friend, Nymphotis Cleadhoe, when he thought Nymphotis had taken it. Ledesmus sells the book to Gersen.

At the reunion, Treesong, assisted by his underlings, imposes imaginative (though non-lethal) humiliations on his childhood tormenters. Gersen, disguised as a musician, shoots and wounds Treesong before fleeing.

Gersen believes the Book could lure Treesong out of hiding. Nymphotis's parents, Otho and Tuty, know Treesong killed their only child and are willing to help. Gersen has 
Cosmopolis
 publish a sensationalized report of Treesong's exploits at the reunion and a letter purportedly from Tuty, in which she calls Howard their son's friend and casually mentions an exercise book she still has. Treesong takes the bait.

The Cleadhoes lure Treesong to their isolated jungle outpost on another world, but leave Gersen (and Alice, now his lover) behind. Gersen and Alice follow. They find that Otho has disposed of Treesong's henchmen, knocked him out and marmelized (converted to a stony substance) his legs. Immobilized, Treesong is seated in an indoor garden facing the marmelized statue of Nymphotis. He mourns his narrow failure to make himself the first Emperor of the Gaean Worlds and asks to be left alone. He then manages to topple himself over face down so that he drowns in a fountain.

As Treesong was the last of five great criminals whom Gersen had set out to kill, Gersen tells Alice that he does not know what he will do now."

The book begins hours after the end of the previous novel. Honor Harrington and her ""Elysian Space Navy"" arrive at Manticoran-controlled space, only to discover that she was believed dead, that her mother had given birth to twins (partly to satisfy the Graysons' need for an heir to her Steading), her cousin Devon has inherited her Manticoran title, and that the extent of her injuries will prevent her from returning to active naval duty for a couple of years, since she needs reconstructive surgery.

To put Honor to good use, the Royal Manticoran Navy promotes her to Admiral (having received a 
battlefield promotion
 to that rank on Hades
[

]
) and places her at Saganami Island Naval Academy to teach future generations of naval officers. Queen 
Elizabeth III
 elevates Honor to Duchess Harrington. Meanwhile, Honor helps to prove that treecats are as intelligent as humans, and she eventually helps to develop an easy to understand sign language system, making full communication between humans and the treecats possible.

After the daring attacks featured in the previous novel, the People's Republic of Haven seems to have the initiative. However, Manticore has a trump card that has the potential to end the war, in the form of devastatingly effective new technology and weapons fully integrated into a new massive heavy assault force, known as 8th fleet. The Star Kingdom's navy bides time, waiting for the opportune moment to strike.

Chaos breaks up in the Havenite ranks, and the ambitious Admiral 
McQueen
 stages a coup that succeeds in killing 
Rob S. Pierre
 and almost all the members of the Havenite Committee of Public Safety, except for 
Oscar Saint-Just
 who manages to crush the coup by detonating a nuclear device secretly hidden within the navy headquarters. With the Committee and the military High Command in ruins, Saint-Just becomes the dictator of the People's Republic, and orders Admiral 
Thomas Theisman
 to take over the massive fleet guarding Haven. This proves to be an eventually fatal miscalculation. While Saint-Just believes Theisman is apolitical and trustworthy, in reality Theisman is plotting a coup of his own, with the secret help of the political commissar Saint-Just has assigned to him.

Admiral White Haven
 launches Manticore's Operation Buttercup. Under his command, 8th Fleet begins a lightning offensive deep into Havenite territory. The new technology developed by Manticore in the prelude to Buttercup allows the fleet to quickly demolish all Havenite resistance, and in a matter of months Manticore becomes poised to invade the Haven system itself. In desperation, Saint-Just attempts to assassinate the Manticoran Alliance leadership. Masadan terrorists in Saint-Just's service succeed in killing the Manticoran Prime Minister, 
The Duke of Cromarty
, along with several major figures of the Manticoran and Grayson governments, despite the efforts of Honor Harrington. Honor's actions save Queen Elizabeth and the Protector of Grayson 
Benjamin Mayhew IX
 from dying in the same attack.

On Manticore, Cromarty's death opens an opportunity for former Opposition factions led by 
Baron High Ridge
 to seize political control, much to the frustration of Queen Elizabeth. Saint-Just proposes an immediate cease-fire between Manticore and Haven. This is hastily accepted by the new High Ridge government, despite the fact that 8th fleet is poised to invade Haven and force an unconditional surrender. High Ridge and his co-partisans in the military come to believe (wrongly) that Haven has been defeated for good, and that further violence is not necessary. The new Manticoran government institutes programs and policy that will begin a legacy of political greed, selfishness, incompetence, and cronyism that will have far reaching consequences for the entire Star Kingdom.

Now secure from the possibility of a Manticoran attack on the Haven System itself, Saint-Just turns to internal matters and the consolidation of his grip on power. He orders the arrest of Admirals 
Lester Tourville
 and 
Javier Giscard
, whom he sees as political dissidents. Theisman launches his coup, the Havenite military wrests control of the government, and Theisman personally executes Saint-Just.

Further information: 
Darkover series


Prologue: The Alien


Paul Harrell, a Terran convict, finds that he has been teleported to an unfamiliar world called Darkover by an aggressive warlord named Bard di Asturien.

Book One: The Foster Brothers


In Castle Asturias, Carlina Asturien prepares for her handfasting ceremony. She tells her nurse that she would rather be a priestess of Avarra, serving the poor and sick. Instead, she is handfasted to Bard di Asturien, for political reasons, though the official wedding is planned for more than a year later. Bard's character – hot tempered, self-centered, misogynist, lacking in empathy – is revealed.

At the midwinter night festival, Bard gets drunk and tries to force himself on Carlina. Geremy Hastur intervenes, and Bard stabs him with a poisoned Dry Towner dagger that he claimed from the battlefield. Hastur survives, but is lamed for life. Bard is judged guilty and sent into exile for seven years.

Bard returns to his father's home to say goodbye before he goes into exile as a mercenary. He meets Melisendra MacAran, who is fostered with his father's family. He uses his laran to force himself on her, but blames Carlina for his actions. As Bard leaves the territory, Beltran and Geremy confront him, and Bard kills Beltran in a sword fight.

Book Two: The Kilghard Wolf


Six years later, Bard, now called Bard mac Fianna or the Wolf, is a mercenary in Scaravel. He learns that King Adrin has died, and that his widow has returned with her infant son to her own kin. Geremy Hastur now claims the right to hold Castle Asturias and its lands. Bard's father, Rafael, asks Bard to return and support his claim to Asturias. He also learns that Melisendra has borne him a son, Erlend.

Bard arrives at his father's home. The following day, Geremy Hastur's envoy arrives to request a truce so their armies may join together to repel an attack from Serrais. The truce is accepted. Bard marches his small army towards Castle Asturias, only to discover that the army of Serrais stands in his way. In battle, Serrais is defeated. Bard meets with Geremy and demands to know Carlina's whereabouts, indicating that he continues to view her as his wife. He fails to retrieve her from the Island of Silence, where she has joined the priestesses of Avarra.

At the wedding of Geremy Hastur and Ginevra Harryl, Bard learns that many of the Towers are now sworn to neutrality, following the example of Varzil Ridenow, Keeper of Neskaya. Varzil arrives to return Alaric di Asturien, Bard's brother, to Castle Asturias. Varzil asks Rafael di Asturien to sign on to The Compact, which forbids the use of laran weapons. Varzil also hints that the era of hundreds of autonomous kingdoms must come to an end if Darkover wants peace. In the end, Rafael di Asturien and Bard clearly oppose it.

Book Three: The Dark Twin


Rafael di Asturien uses his own laran training to teleport Bard's duplicate, the Terran Paul Harrell, to Darkover. Bard explains the basics of Darkover to Harrell, now called Paolo Harryl. He is passed off at court as a nedestro relation. Bard gives Melisendra to Paul, which backfires when they fall in love.

Bard discovers that Paul is immune to laran-based illusions and decides to use him to retrieve Carlina from the Island of Silence. Paul succeeds in kidnapping her, and returns her to Bard. Bard rapes her, justifying his actions with the claim that they are married (which they aren't). Carlina uses her laran to overwhelm Bard with the empathy he lacks, making him feel the humiliation and fear of all of the women he has used. Emotionally wrecked, he asks Paul to take over as Lord General.

Bard rides to Neskaya Tower, seeking assistance from Melora MacAran. He admits that he is better knowing the truth about himself and about what he has done to those around him.

Varzil the Good, Keeper of Neskaya, explains that several other Towers have joined The Compact, since the recent destruction of Hali. He explains that Bard is a pivot around which history flows, and that Bard's acceptance of The Compact will help unify Darkover.

Melisendra helps Carlina recover from her ordeal. Carlina realizes that the Priestesses of Avarra can work with the Sisterhood of the Sword to aid those unable to travel to the Island of Silence. It's hinted that these two groups will eventually evolve into the Order of Renunciates.

Castle Asturias is attacked.  Carlina, Melisendra and others escape. Rafael di Asturien and his son, Alaric, die when a staircase collapses, and with them, the only legitimate claimant to the Asturias throne. Paul Harrell is crowned king, having been mistaken for Bard. He marries Melisendra.

The real Bard returns to the castle with Varzil the Good. The tower workers join Carlina in nursing the wounded. Bard and Paul straighten out their mistaken identity problem, Bard claiming that Paul was acting as his proxy.

Geremy Hastur arrives, offering an alliance between Hastur and di Asturien. He reports that all of the Towers have now sworn neutrality, and that their stockpiles of laran weapons will be destroyed. The alliance must now hold Aldaran to his side of the Karadin River, since he has refused to sign The Compact.

Aldaran attacks with clingfire, destroying the rest of the castle. Paul and Bard work to get the survivors out of the castle. Bard comes to realize that he must release Carlina in order to marry Melora, whom he truly loves."

In Merle's MaleviI, following the holocaust of nuclear chain-reactions, the rationalistic communal life of Malevil castle under the direction of Emmanuel Comte comes into conflict with an oppressive theocracy imposed on a neighboring village by the hypocritical false priest Fulbert le Naud. The ensuing struggle for supremacy not only validates the humanism of Malevil's system, but also indirectly validates the need for technology, since the struggle convinces the inhabitants of Malevil that they must begin research into the reinvention of weapons in order to protect their interests and values—despite their acute awareness of what the technology of weaponry can ultimately lead to."

Miles and 
Ekaterin
 Vorkosigan are enjoying a delayed honeymoon off-world while their first two children are approaching birth in their uterine replicators back on Barrayar. On their way home, Miles receives Emperor Gregor Vorbarra's command to go to Graf Station in Quaddiespace to untangle a diplomatic incident in his capacity as the nearest Imperial Auditor. There, he is unexpectedly reunited with the Betan 
hermaphrodite
 Bel Thorne, a trusted former Dendarii Mercenaries subordinate and his good friend, now working for the Quaddies (as well as Barrayaran Imperial Security as a secret observer).

Quaddies are the result of genetic manipulation centuries before (as described in Bujold's novel 
Falling Free
).  Intended to be used as laborers in 
zero-G
, they have extra arms instead of legs. However, the invention of artificial gravity suddenly made them unprofitable to the corporation that created them. They stole a spaceship to avoid being confined to a barracks on a planet for the rest of their lives and colonized a remote star system. At Graf Station, the Quaddies occupy a zero-G section, while visitors use a section with artificial gravity. Quaddies tend to be suspicious of other humans based on their history of callous exploitation.

A convoy of Komarran merchant ships is being prevented from leaving the station due to trouble caused by Barrayaran personnel from their military escort. Furthermore, a Barrayaran security officer is missing, possibly murdered or deserted.

While investigating, Miles uncovers a plot by a high-ranking, renegade, sexless Cetagandan, who has stolen a cargo of extreme importance to the Cetagandans and attempts to hide its tracks by framing Barrayar (and killing the missing Barrayaran officer). By the time Miles figures out what is going on, he and Bel have become infected by a highly lethal 
bioweapon
. Miles nearly dies, but he reaches the nearest Cetagandan world and averts an interstellar war between Cetaganda and Barrayar with his discoveries. He and Bel are cured by the Cetagandans, though they are both, to differing degrees, permanently debilitated."

The narrator, Walker Easterling, is a film actor and screenwriter. His director friend Nicholas Sylvian introduces him to Maris York, a sculptor who makes model cities and who is freeing herself from Luc, her abusive partner. On the day Maris and Walker meet, Luc has just threatened to kill her, so Walker and Nicholas take her away to 
Vienna
, where Maris and Walker commence a relationship. Walker, who knows nothing about his parents or family background, discovers that he can perform magical acts and has dreams of inhabiting another identity, that of an Austrian named Moritz Benedikt who fought in the 
First World War
 and was subsequently murdered. After Maris' brother Ingram loses his lover in an earthquake, Walker is able to foretell, or induce, Ingram's meeting with a certain Michael Billa, who will be a significant person in Ingram's life. (The consequences of Ingram's and Billa's friendship are recounted in 
Black Cocktail
.) Through an acquaintance, screenwriter Philip Strayhorn, Walker meets Venasque, a mystic and teacher who appears in several other Carroll books. With Venasque's help, Walker learns to control his talent, but inadvertently causes Venasque's death because of the strength of his powers. He is contacted by his real father, a little man with no genitals whose name he does not know. The little man is an immortal (and the real-life source of the 
Rumpelstiltskin
 legend) who has murdered all Walker's previous incarnations, the last of whom was Moritz Benedikt, because they kept falling in love with women and repudiating the little man's sterile immortality. His father tries to persuade Walker to leave Maris by telling him that she'll mourn him forever and never love anyone else; this above all persuades Walker that his father is selfish and evil. Thanks to his and Maris' complete understanding of each other, Walker is able to discover his father's name in a city which Maris is building him as a birthday present. Walker uses his magic powers to call up the two sisters who originally told the Rumpelstiltskin story to the 
Grimm brothers
. The sisters retell the story, changing it to end with the little man's death. Soon after Maris' and Walker's son is born, a little girl (apparently the original source of the 
Little Red Riding Hood
 story) appears on the doorstep and tells Walker: ""You're dangerous."" As Walker observes that ""nothing in life is done without regret"", it seems that his and Maris' son has been affected in some way by the vengeful immortals."

Romilly MacAran has the 
laran
 gift of her family – the ability to merge with the minds of animals. She uses this gift to train hawks and horses. When she reaches the age of fifteen (womanhood, in Darkover's terms), her father refuses to allow her to continue working with animals on the grounds that it isn't ladylike. He gives her prized hawk, Preciosa, to her brother, who has no gift. He also refuses her requests for an education.

When Romilly learns that her father intends to marry her off to a three-times widower, Garris of Scathfell, she realizes that leaving home is her only option. Dressed as a boy, she escapes with a horse from the stables.

Calling herself Rumal, she heads towards Nevarsin. Her hawk, Preciosa, appears in the sky, and provides her with a freshly killed bird, the first meal she has had in several days. Her fire attracts a company of men, headed by Dom Carlo and Dom Orain, who have three sick sentry birds that need care. They, too, are headed to Nevarsin, and Romilly takes over the care of their birds. Romilly reveals that she is a 
cristoforo
. Dom Carlo claims to be a kinsman of the deposed king, Carolin, and is fleeing his cousin, Rakhal, who has taken the throne by force.

At Nevarsin, the company enters the 
cristoforo
 monastery of St. Valentine of the Snows. Romilly discovers that Caryl, the son of Lyondri Hastur, one of Dom Carlo's bitterest enemies, is a student at the monastery. Romilly warns Orain.

Orain and Carlo believe themselves betrayed, and leave the monastery, taking Caryl Hastur as a hostage. Caryl is put in Romilly's care.

At an inn in Caer Donn, Orain makes a pass at Romilly, believing her to be a boy, and is shocked to discover that she is a girl. He takes her to the hostel of the Sisterhood of the Sword where his cousin, Jandria, lives. He also asks Jandria to take charge of Caryl Hastur. Romilly becomes a member of the Sisterhood. A contingent of the Sisterhood join Carolin's forces. Romilly's hawk, Preciosa, reappears.

At Jandria's request, Romilly accompanies Caryl back to his father in Hali city. Romilly returns to Jandria with medical supplies. At Serrais, Romilly is assigned to train horses, among them a black stallion whom she names Sunstar. She and Jandria deliver the horses to Carolin's camp, where her brother, Ruyven, is also engaged caring for the sentry birds. At that time, Romilly discovers that ""Dom Carlo"" is actually King Carolin Hastur.

Several days later, the two armies engage in battle. Carolin learns that Lyondri is holding Orain and threatening to kill him. Romilly sneaks into the city, and is able to find Orain's location. She meets Caryl, who out of disgust with his father's torture of Orain, agrees to help free him. They return to Carolin's camp.

The novel centers on 
Glawen Clattuc
, an intelligent, capable young man. Glawen's father Scharde foils an attempt by an old family enemy, Spanchetta Clattuc, to falsely inflate Glawen's ""index number"" and thereby reduce his chances of achieving Agency status. He joins 
Bureau B
, the department responsible for enforcing the laws of the Charter.

Glawen becomes romantically involved with the beautiful Sessily Veder. When Sessily disappears, an investigation suggests she was raped and murdered, her body shipped off-planet in a wine cask. However, there is insufficient evidence to convict the primary suspect, Spanchetta's son Arles.

Later, Glawen becomes acquainted with and attracted to 
Wayness Tamm
, the daughter of the new Conservator.  Glawen saves Wayness from a rape attempt by Arles. Then, after the murder of her brother (engineered by a Yip), Wayness reveals to Glawen that while she was visiting 
Earth
, her father's cousin became the secretary of the nearly moribund Naturalist Society and discovered that the Charter was missing (a previous secretary had been a thief and sold the society's assets). Whoever possesses it is the legal owner of Cadwal. She decides to return alone to Earth to search for it.

Glawen is ordered by Bureau B chief Bodwyn Wook to join the Bold Lions (a boisterous drinking club for devil-may-care youths) and travel to Yipton with them on an annual jaunt, using the opportunity to spy on the Yips. He is accompanied by Kirdy Wook, a Bold Lion and also a Bureau B agent. Glawen discovers that the Yips are secretly assembling a flyer (a flying vehicle), most likely to further their goal of seizing Deucas. However, Glawen is spotted. He gets away, but Kirdy is caught and tortured by the Yips. With great difficulty, Bodwyn Wook secures his release. Although Kirdy recovers physically, his mind is severely affected, and Glawen senses that Kirdy nurtures an intense irrational hatred for him.

Glawen travels to a small island for a holiday. To his horror, he discovers that ""parties"" are being held there in which rich off-worlders are allowed to have their way with young Yip girls, who are then killed. An outraged Bodwyn Wook has them arrested, but is persuaded to allow the wealthy prisoners to pay very large fines instead of being executed in order to pay for desperately needed flyers and weapons to counter the Yip threat.

He sends Glawen off-world to discover the identity of the organizers and, to Glawen's disquiet, orders that Kirdy accompany him. Kirdy eventually betrays Glawen, who is imprisoned by a sect which believes in total equality of the sexes. Their extreme stance has led to a declining population. Their leader informs Glawen that he is to be a sex slave to remedy the situation. It turns out some of the sect members had participated in the ""parties"" in a prior attempt to solve their dilemma.  After six months, Glawen manages to escape and shut down the sect.

He then returns to Cadwal and finally identifies Sessily's murderer: Kirdy Wook. Kirdy had been jealous of Glawen from childhood. Kirdy attempts to kill Glawen on a beach, but Glawen lures him out into the water; a weak swimmer, Kirdy is dragged out to sea by the 
undertow
 and drowns.

Glawen has also uncovered the organizer of the sex parties. Floreste is an dramatist who will go to any lengths to fund his dream: the construction of a magnificent new Orpheum. Condemned to death, Floreste refuses to divulge any information until Glawen threatens to sue and seize his hard-won funds as damages. Glawen's father Scharde, a senior Bureau B agent, is missing and presumed dead in an accident while on patrol, but Floreste confirms that he is actually a prisoner. He also inadvertently gives Glawen startling news as to who is really leading the Yips."

Jahna
 (31 kya, 
Western France
). A girl living in a settlement during the 
Ice Age
. Her people's village, cognitive capacity and culture are more sophisticated than those of neanderthals, which they often abuse and exploit. While hunting, Jahna and her brother get lost when an ice storm breaks. Days later, they take shelter in the cave of a massive, 40-year-old neanderthal male, ""Old Man"". Though superficially dangerous and unable to speak, Old Man takes care of them. However, a team led by their father eventually finds them and bludgeons Old Man in his sleep, amidst the children's protests.

Juna
 (9.6 kya, 
Anatolia
). A pregnant 15-year-old girl living in a famine-struck hunter-gatherer village. She accepts to become the slave of Cahl, the beer trader, to save her unborn child from being killed at birth. At Cahl's hometown, Juna learns about agriculture and is put to work in the fields. Although food is plenty, 
monoculture
 means that the villagers' diet and health are poorer than those of hunter-gatherers. When tribute-collector Keram arrives, Juna learns about the city of 
Cata Huuk
, and convinces him that she was kidnapped from there long ago. In part due to her healthier appearance, Keram takes her with him, despite Cahl's protests. Cata Huuk is Earth's first city, and its leader, the Potus, the first king. Juna is made to dance naked for the Potus, and eventually partners up with Keram. He gives birth to her child and then Keram's. After four years of plenitude, famine-caused revolts force the family to flee Cata Huuk. Along the way, Keram brings Juna to the ruins of her original and now 
measles-struck
 village, where she finds her sister as the sole survivor.

Away on a cave expedition, Athalaric asks Honorius to become a priest on his father's request, to lead Rome away from decay. Honorius however is not interested and is murdered by the henchmen of Athalaric's father. His remains are buried next to Old Man's.

Joan Useb
 (21st century). A paleontologist of 
San
 and European ancestry. In 2031, she is pregnant and flying to a conference in 
Rabaul
 on global warming, where she meets primatologist Alyce Sigurdardottir and Bex Scott, the genetically enhanced daughter of celebrity scientist Alison Scott. As protesters from the ""Fourth World"" disrupt the conference, the Rabaul caldera erupts, setting the sequence of events that collapse civilization. In the epilogue, set in 2049, a 52-year-old Joan and her 18-year-old daughter Lucy rescue 
feral children
 left behind in the 
Galápagos Islands
 due to the ensuing wars and toxic rain. Reflecting on humanity's bleak future, Lucy asks Joan whether she has been happy and she responds affirmatively, based on the fact that unlike their ancestors, they have a glimpse into the past and can be certain that some form of life will survive into the far future.

Robert Wayne ""Snowy"" Snow
 (millennia from now, 
United Kingdom

cryogenic sleep
. During the post-Rabaul wars, the 
United Nations
 deploys military officers in suspended animation worldwide to deter international invasions. Centuries later, officers Snowy, Ahmed, Sidewise, Bonner and Moon awaken and soon realize that human civilization has long collapsed. Ahmed, the leader, attempts to rebuild civilization, but with Moon being the only female, crops being long extinct and not knowing how to recreate even the most basic technology, Sidewise and Bonner agree that Ahmed's plan is completely unrealistic. A month later, Snowy discovers that there actually are humans, now feral and without language. Internal conflicts distance Sidewise and Bonner, Moon disappears, Ahmed succumbs to 
mercury poisoning
 from fish, and Snowy chooses to spend the rest of his life following the feral people. As Snowy arrives to the coast of 
Sussex
, he reflects on how everything humans ever made has vanished.

Remembrance
 (30 My from now, Western Africa). A monkey-like post-human female. The descendants of 
feral children
 have diversified into many non-sapient species, from everything resembling arboreal primates (Remembrance's kind), 
eusocial
 moles, and elephants, the latter being ""farmed"" by rodents. They inhabit a lush forest, still having some artificial remains like bits of glass, 
bitumen
 and copper. Avoiding rodent and avian predators, Remembrance falls into a mole-folk pit, where she survives for several days. She eventually returns to the canopy, but soon the impact of 
Eros
 unleashes a 
mass extinction
.

Ultimate
 (500 My from now, Montana). A 
capuchin-like
 post-human female inhabiting the deserts of 
Pangaea Ultima
. Her species is closely symbiotic with 
borametz trees
, which grow pods to sleep and nurse their young. Due to the harsh climate, the tree begins consuming Ultimate's child, and she takes her to the desert, accompanied with her friend, Cactus. They encounter descendants of beetles, rats, lizards and toads, and Cactus is hunted by a huge, transparent salamander. A few days later, Ultimate arrives to the shores of a drying inland sea, where she finds the hardened footprints of one of her kind, both of them being the last ""human"" explorers. After returning and giving her child to the tree, Ultimate becomes the last primate to reproduce, and soon her herd and tree die. In the following eons Earth is consumed by the Sun, but hibernating bacteria are hurled into space and end up on the seas of a habitable 
exoplanet
, starting evolution again.



Protagonists outside the Purga–human line
[

Characters listed below are not ancestral to or descend from humans, although some are primates and thus descend from Purga.

Listener
 (145 Mya, 
Pangaea
). A female 
Ornitholestes
 living with Stego, her mate. Unlike most animals in the book, they are fully 
sapient
, with complex language, leather belts, whips, and a culture that revolves around 
Diplodocus
 hunting. Stego is killed by an 
Allosaurus
 during a hunt, and Listener swears to kill the 
Diplodocus
 matriarch that indirectly caused his death. Ten years later, she and her three sons manage to hunt the matriarch, which dooms the herd as well as the 
Ornitholestes
 settlement. They become extinct and humans never discover that another sapient species preceded them.

Roamer
 (32 Mya, North Africa). A female of a capuchin-like primate species unknown to paleontology. After a flood destroys her home, she finds herself and other members of her species on a haphazard raft on the Atlantic. Starvation and thirst nearly kill them, but Roamer and two other survivors eventually land on the rainforests of 
Yucatán
 and their descendants give rise to a new line of monkeys.

Dig
 (10 Mya, 
Antarctica
). A female of a 
lemming-like
 primate species. The Antarctica she inhabits still has forests inhabited by the descendants of 
Velociraptor
, 
Allosaurus
 and 
Muttaburrasaurus
. Though more temperate than today, the Antarctic forests are becoming progressively colder and more inhospitable. Ice caps completely bury the remains of Dig's ecosystem and humans never discover that non-avian dinosaurs survived 55 million years longer than previously thought.

Johnnie
 (21st century, 
Mars
). Humanity's first 
self-replicating robot
, which lands on Mars during Joan's conference. Although its original purpose is to construct bases for human habitation, it stops receiving orders due to the chaos unleashed by Rabaul's eruption on Earth and continues replicating itself unhindered. Within a few centuries, Johnnie's descendants have consumed the planet entirely and leave the Solar System. As the self-replication process is imperfect, they begin undergoing a process akin to biological evolution. About 500 million years later, a self-aware probe arrives on Earth to investigate the origins of its kind. Although it encounters evidence of past intelligent activity, and even Ultimate —its creators' descendant— it considers its mission a failure and leaves."

Robinette Broadhead, a married millionaire with health problems, returns in this novel. Even with his need for medical care, Broadhead does not feel that he deserves transplants to keep him alive, as he is still feeling guilty about his horrible journey to a black hole many years ago. He still attempts to research more about the advanced alien 
Heechees
 and their star-travelling technology.

At the same time, a madman named Wan attempts to search for his father within black holes, using stolen equipment and a Heechee ship. Wan's probing is noticed by a sentient race of slow-moving creatures who inform a Heechee patrol that is sent out of their black hole to observe the galaxy. Fearing that humans may alert a malevolent race of beings known as the Assassins, the Heechee patrol tries to find out more about human achievements in space flight and whether or not the damage done by them can be undone. Wan's probing also releases Gelle-Klara Moynlin from her two decade-long entrapment. Moynlin was a companion of Robinette on his journey to the black hole, which Moynlin experienced as only several elapsed days. The journeys of these past and future friends of Robinette begin to converge, and in the end, humans finally meet the Heechee race."

The Hindmost, recently deposed leader of the 
Puppeteers
, abducts the human 
Louis Wu
 (who has become a 
wirehead
) and the 
Kzin
 
Chmeee
 (previously known as ""Speaker-to-Animals""). Both had been part of the original Ringworld expedition. The Hindmost hopes to acquire Ringworld technology, specifically matter transmutation, to help him regain his position.

Once they reach the Ringworld, Louis and Chmeee are sent out to explore, while the Hindmost remains safely behind on their starship. Louis and Chmeee secretly plot to try to overthrow the Hindmost so they can go home. In their travels, they meet a number of the 
hominid
 
species
 that have evolved on the Ringworld. They also learn more about the full-scale ""maps"" of various 
known space
 worlds, including Earth, 
Mars
 and Kzin.

They discover that the Ringworld has become unstable and will collide with its star soon. The Ringworld's builders, revealed to be 
Pak Protectors
, have long since died out, and the attitude jets they installed all around the rim to maintain the Ringworld's position were dismounted to use as starship engines. Chmeee goes to the Kzin map for his own goals, while Louis tries to find some way to save the trillions of inhabitants.

It is on the Map of Mars that the reunited party (and two natives) finds the Ringworld control room Louis is seeking, located in a vast maze of rooms in the hollow space under the map. To create the rarefied atmosphere on Mars, the Map of Mars was built 20 miles (32 km) above the main surface, creating a 1,120,000,000-cubic-mile (4.7
×
10
9
 km
3
) cavity. The control room contains living space and, among other things, the meteor defense system. The defense system uses the superconductor grid embedded in the Ringworld's 
scrith
 floor to manipulate the magnetic field of the Ringworld's sun to trigger 
stellar flares
 that power a titanic 
gas laser
. (The first expedition to the Ringworld crashed after their ship was hit by this laser.)

They encounter 
Teela Brown
, a human member of the first expedition who had chosen to remain on Ringworld. She and her lover Seeker had, in the course of their travels, stumbled upon ""Tree-of-Life"" plants. The smell of the plant drove them to eat its roots; Teela was turned into a Pak Protector, with superhuman intelligence and strength, but Seeker died, being too old to undergo the transformation. As a Pak Protector, Teela has little control of her actions; her protective instincts force her to try to save 
all
 of the Ringworld inhabitants. This causes a dilemma. She knows of a way to save the Ringworld, but it would entail killing 5% of the people. This she cannot do. She manages to lure Louis and the others to where they can save the other 95%. Her instincts make her fight them, but she does so half-heartedly so that they can kill her.

Afterward, Louis figures out what to do. Teela had restored starship engines to their original purpose as attitude jets, but only had enough for 5% of the ring. Louis explains that the meteor defense system can generate a massive stellar flare (normally used to power the laser weapon) to provide twenty times more fuel to the attitude jets to move the Ringworld back into position. However, the radiation from the flare will be fatal to everything and everyone living on that section of the Ringworld. The actual task is carried out by the Hindmost, who is far superior at operating the control systems (and can safely pass through a Tree-of-Life plantation en route to the control center, as Louis cannot).

Having earlier destroyed the hyperdrive to force the Hindmost to cooperate, Louis is stranded. He and the rest of his party look for some place to settle down, while the Hindmost remains aboard the disabled (but very safe) starship to think things over."

Mark, 
Miles Vorkosigan
's 
clone
, masquerades as him and hijacks a part of his mercenary force, the Dendarii, to try to free about 50 clones on Jackson's Whole, an anything-goes freebooters' planet where Mark was created and raised. These teenage clones are scheduled to have their brains replaced by those of their wealthy, aged progenitors. When Miles finds out, he attempts to rescue his troops and his brother from the mess Mark has made, but is killed by a needle grenade. He is frozen in a 
cryonic
 chamber on the spot, but the medic in charge becomes separated from the rest of the men while retreating under fire. The medic uses an automated shipping system to send the chamber to safety, but is killed before he can tell anyone what he did and where he sent it.

The Dendarii flee the debacle and take Mark to Miles' parents on Barrayar. Cordelia accepts him as a son and has him acknowledged legally as a member of the family. After a while, Mark becomes frustrated by Barrayaran Imperial Security's lack of progress; he is convinced that Miles is still on Jackson's Whole and decides to search there himself. Cordelia helps by buying him a starship. He invites some of the Dendarii along, including Captain Quinn, Miles' second-in-command and lover.

Meanwhile, Miles has been secretly received and resuscitated by the Duronas, a research group cloned from a medical genius and employed by Jackson's Whole magnate Baron Fell. They hope they have Miles (rather than Mark) under their care, but he is suffering from normal, hopefully temporary, post-revival 
amnesia
, so they are unsure. The Duronas wish to hire the Dendarii, who are known for pulling off difficult extractions, to help them escape from Jackson's Whole. Miles' memory takes some time to return.

Mark finds Miles, but is captured by Miles' old nemesis, Baron Ryoval, and tortured for five days. His personality fragments into four sub-personalities: Gorge the glutton, Grunt the sex pervert, Howl the masochist, and Killer the assassin. Together, the first three protect Mark's fragile persona, while Killer bides his time. When Ryoval's assistant informs him that Mark seems to have adjusted remarkably quickly and is actually enjoying the torture, a frustrated Ryoval decides to study his victim alone. Killer takes the opportunity to kill Ryoval, enabling Mark to escape. Mark sells Ryoval's security access codes to Baron Fell for a large sum of money and the Durona Group's freedom.

Miles' short death and revivification have serious repercussions for his health. Mark has his own problems, thanks to his strange upbringing, complicated by the torture. When he asks his mother for help, she sends him to Beta Colony for psychiatric treatment and therapy.

By necessity, this novel is told from the viewpoints of Miles and Mark. This was the first novel in the Vorkosigan series to be written this way, though not the first time Bujold has employed this style; the first occasion was in 
Falling Free

The Gzilt, a civilisation that almost joined 
the Culture
 10,000 years before the novel, have decided to Sublime, leaving behind “the Real” to take up residence in higher dimensions. The Zihdren-Remnant, what is left of an older species that Sublimed before the Culture was formed, send an envoy to confess a long-kept secret before the Gzilt depart but a Gzilt warship intercepts and destroys their ship several weeks before the Sublimation is due to take place in order to preserve that secret.

The Culture sends ships both to wish the Gzilt well, as they have always been on good terms with the Gzilt, and to keep an eye on the younger species arriving to scavenge the technology and infrastructure the Gzilt leave behind. Two of these, the Liseiden (an eel-like species) and the Ronte (a hive insect-like species) are jockeying in negotiations with the Gzilt for official permission and preferred status.

Vyr Cossont is introduced as a former Lieutenant-Commander (reserve) of the Gzilt, who has set herself a life-task of playing T. C. Vilabier's 26th String-Specific Sonata For An Instrument Yet To Be Invented, the eponymous Hydrogen Sonata, on the instrument subsequently invented for its performance: the Antagonistic Undecagonstring, or elevenstring. In order to do so, she has had to grow two additional arms. Both the instrument and the work are presented as unusually challenging.

Spyware aboard the Gzilt warship has transmitted the secret to the 14th Regiment, traditional opponents of the current power structure and erstwhile dissenters in the decision to Sublime; they recruit Cossont, who once knew Ngaroe QiRia, a Culture citizen who may be able to verify the truth of the Zihdren secret. Alerted to their knowledge and doing all he can to ensure a smooth Sublimation, Septame Banstegeyn orders their destruction. Cossont barely escapes, and is eventually picked up by the 
Mistake Not…
, a Culture ship of non-standard class. They begin to head towards the storage facility where Cossont left the mind state QiRia had given her, but are interrupted by intelligence that he had stopped at Xown, where Cossont had been living, some five years earlier. Despite confirmation that he had indeed stopped there, they are unable to locate the information they need.

Meanwhile, a group of 
Minds
 dealing with the issue wake Scoaliera Tefwe, a former lover of QiRia who has been Stored for many centuries. She agrees to try and track him down, and her mind state is sent to inhabit a pair of new bodies, stopping for information from an old drone. When she finds him, he reveals he has had the memories removed.

Cossont and the 
Mistake Not...
 successfully retrieve QiRia’s mind-state, but only after being attacked in the storage facility on Banstegeyn’s orders. Unfortunately, the memories have also been wiped from the mind state, and they have to return to Xown when they realise where they have been hidden. Cossont manages to retrieve the memories despite heavy attack and the loss of the ship’s avatar.

The Gzilt Book of Truth is revealed to have been a sociological experiment by a fringe Zihdren scientist that was subsequently forgotten. This had been disclosed to QiRia and other members of the prospective Culture. After finding this out and deciding it would not affect the ability of the Gzilt to join the Culture being formed, their minds had been wiped of these memories. However, experimental memory storage augmentation in QiRia prevented the memories from being properly removed.

The other Minds in the group decide to keep the secret, and some 99.9% of the Gzilt Sublime. Cossont is one of the few that does not. She leaves behind her elevenstring instrument, and considers rejoining the 
Mistake Not...
 to visit QiRia at the planet where he is on retreat, and returning his memories."

This book takes place about fifteen years after the end of the original story, when survivors of the Dalton-Quinn tree, a few Carther States jungle dwellers, and two London Tree Citizens have settled on a new tree. This 'Citizen's Tree' has become a stable community which some believe may be too small to survive in the long run.

Kendy, the recorded personality of a citizen of ""
The State
"" who exists in the computer of the original space-ship that colonized the Smoke Ring, has become impatient. He decides to re-establish contact with Citizen's Tree. Kendy manipulates a group into making contact with ""The Admiralty"", a neighboring civilization at Gold's L4 
Lagrange Point
 (which they refer to as ""the Clump""). The group explores this more advanced civilization with a mixture of wonder and trepidation.

Although much of the story is a sort of ""
travelogue
"" exploring the Smoke Ring and the technology used in the unique environment, 
The Smoke Ring
 does spend more time on story and character development than 
The Integral Trees
. One of the drivers for the story follows the latest operator of ""the silver suit"", the Citizen's Tree's working spacesuit. Few are capable of operating the suit due to its size; due to the lack of gravity, most humans in the Smoke Ring grow too tall to fit into it. The job goes to the occasionally born ""dwarves"" who tend to develop into humans of Earth-normal height and build. A major sub-plot develops around the latest silver suit operator's attempts to infiltrate The Admiralty to gain information, and The Admiralty's near obsession with capturing the Citizen's Tree's spacesuit.

This focuses  on the story of Kendy and the original mission. The chain of events that led to the colonization of the Smoke Ring through a ""mutiny"" on the ship is explored. After retrieving the crew's own records of the events, Kendy realizes that the crew had not mutinied at all, and that he had forced them off the ship, believing this to be in keeping with his orders from Earth. This was apparently blocked from his memory, and he suffers a form of breakdown when he learns (or re-learns) the truth."

 infrastructure from an early terraforming phase. Upon learning that the ribbons still exist, Verdance declares war on Spider, firing orbital lasers. Verdance employees rebel. Destry is able to force Verdance to sign a treaty, granting Spider limited sovereignty under threat of the ribbons.

700 years later, a new team composed of Spider residents (an Archaean named Sulfur and a bot) and Verdance employees (a cow and an 
H. sapiens
) are tasked with performing an environmental survey and creating a planetary inter-city public transit plan for Verdance and the largest landowner, Emerald. They tour several settlements and observe that both Verdance and Emerald aim to keep Sask-E a private planet by hamstringing all public services in favor of private ones. In protest, the team recommends establishing a community of self-governing 
anti-gravity
 train people under Spider sovereignty as the best long-term solution for providing transport. Emerald approves the plan, ignoring the sovereignty implications. Spider bioengineers birth the first trains.

904 years later, Scrubjay, a member of the Flying Train Fleet worker co-op, befriends Moose, a homeless journalist cat, who is digging up dirt against Sask-E's monopoly landowner Emerald. Moose teaches Scrubjay about protests to make Sask-E a public planet in response to widespread 
gentrification
 problems. They help evacuate refugees evicted by lethal orbital strikes fired by Emerald to cleanse its cities of unslaved non-
H. sapiens
. Scrubjay and Moose uncover ancient legal documents that prove Emerald defrauded real estate customers by charging license fees for public domain 
H. sapiens
 genome sequences. They also discover that Emerald's approval of the self-governing train community also disqualifies Sask-E from private planet status in the interstellar government. Spider and the Flying Train Fleet vote not to activate the ribbons in response to the orbital strikes and to apply for recognition by the wider interstellar government as governments of a public planet."

The Rowan
 tells the life story of a young orphan, of Prime Talent, from the moment the child's community is wiped out in a mudslide to the time when she becomes a Prime and after a life of loneliness falls in love with a previously undiscovered Prime on Deneb which was being attacked by 
aliens
.

The central section of the book is based on McCaffrey's earlier short story ""Lady in the Tower"".



Characters
[
edit
]


The Rowan/Angharad Gwyn
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-1 telekinetic/telepath; Callisto Prime


Physical description: with silver-white hair and grey eyes (though stated to be brown on page 17 of the Ace/Putnam 1990 hardcover edition), she has a petite, ""bird like"" figure.

The Rowan is the only survivor of a freak mudslide that destroyed the Rowan Mining Camp on Altair. Trapped in a hopper (ground vehicle) and buried in sludge for days, the 3 year-old toddler's mental cries for help reach every telepath on the planet. Rescued, she is made a ""Ward of the Planet"" but, with no memory of her life before the mudslide, becomes known as ""the Rowan child"". She grows up under the care of Lusena, a child therapist who becomes her foster mother.


Well aware of her Prime potential, her guardians move her to Altair's Tower at the age of twelve, to be instructed in the use of her Talent by Altair's Prime, Siglen. After a difficult learning curve and lonely adolescence she ultimately reaches Prime status and is installed on 
Jupiter
's moon, 
Callisto
.


Siglen
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-1 telekinetic/telepath; Altair Prime


Physical description: Siglen was a slab of a female, soft from a sedentary life and a disinclination to exercise of any kind.

Siglen proved to be more harm than good when it came to dealing with the Rowan. She wasn't empathic towards the child and instilled a 
neurosis
 (a form of 
agoraphobia
 that prevents interstellar teleports) in the three Primes that she trained. She has no empathy and is very trying for her staff and personnel to deal with. She is described as a ""mistress of the putdown"" and a generally unlikeable person.


Lusena
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-8 telepath; junior therapist

Lusena took the young Rowan in as her own. She already had two older children, Bardy and Finnan. Lusena died in a crash when the Rowan was eighteen.


Goswina Lyon
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-5 empath

Goswina first met the Rowan when she, along with seven other young Talents, traveled to Altair for a course on Tower management and maintenance. She soon realized that she and the Rowan could not work efficiently together and so recommended her brother Afra, who at the time was six. The Rowan then promised to make sure Afra came to Altair for the course when he was old enough.


Afra Lyon
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-4 (later T-3 then T-2) telekinetic/telepath


Physical description: blonde hair, slightly green skin, yellow eyes, tall/slender figure.

The Lyon family is from Capella, a ""Methody"" planet known for its adherence to rules and manners (and its colonists' unusual pigmentation). Afra, however, was slightly different; life on Capella didn't appeal to him. At eighteen, Afra spent all his money to send a resume to the Rowan, the new Callisto Prime. The Prime sent for him the very next day. Afra was to the Rowan's liking and became second in command of the Tower.


Jeff Raven
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-1 telekinetic/telepath


Physical description: black hair and piercing blue eyes.

Jeff Raven was born on Deneb where a large population of ""Wild Talents"" resides. He first contacted the Rowan telepathically when he ""heard"" her getting ready to start her transportation work on Callisto. Jeff informed her that Deneb was under attack by hostile alien forces. The Rowan informed Earth Prime who refused to believe the words of an ""unknown Talent""; Jeff quickly verified the attack was legitimate by telekinetically hurtling a missile towards Earth (which was quite an extraordinary feat considering how remote Deneb was and that the generator he tapped into for power was on the verge of collapse)


Isthia Raven
[
edit
]


Talent level: never tested, but she has a ""long ear"" and ""loud voice"".

Isthia is the mother of Jeff Raven. She gathered a team of other untrained Talents to help her contact the Rowan telepathically when Jeff was badly injured in an accident after the attacks.


Peter Reidinger IV
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-1 telekinetic/telepath; Earth Prime


Physical description: Black hair, close trimmed red beard and moustache. He is the descendant of the same Peter Reidinger who is featured in 
Pegasus in Flight
 and 
Pegasus in Space
.


The Reidinger family is full of extremely high Talents, and Peter Reidinger IV is surely one of the most powerful. He runs FT&T.


Elizara Matheson
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-1 Medic/Ob. Deft, compassionate, sensible and reassuring, Elizara is Prime Reidinger's great-granddaughter. She became a close friend and confidant of the Gwyn-Raven families, and later the Lyons, when she was assigned by Reidinger to assist the Rowan during her first pregnancy. Elizara is extremely skilled in metamorphic healing as well as physical. She is later re-introduced into the series as the very talented teacher of her gifted namesake, Zara Raven-Lyon, one of 
Damia
's many children.


Brian Ackerman
[
edit
]


Talent Level: T-9; Callisto Stationmaster



Primes
[
edit
]


Primes of FT&T are T-1 telekinetic/telepaths. They are the rarest manifestation of Talent:



Earth Prime: Peter Reidinger IV


Altair Prime: Siglen


Capella Prime: Capella


Betelguese Prime: David


Callisto Prime: The Rowan

Evelyn Caldwell receives a call from Martine, an identical clone of her created by her husband, Nathan. Nathan cheated on Evelyn with Martine and divorced her soon after. Martine reveals to Evelyn that she is pregnant; Evelyn blames Martine for taking the life she deserved from her. Later, Martine asks Evelyn to come over and ushers her into their house, where she reveals Nathan's dead body, having stabbed him to death with a kitchen knife. Evelyn reluctantly helps Martine bury his corpse and use his DNA to create an identical clone of him to help Martine to take care of their child, although they wipe his memories and make it seem that Martine is Evelyn; they also install a kill switch just in case.

Some time later, Martine calls Evelyn over again and reveals that while digging in the back yard, she discovered the bodies of 12 copies of her; Evelyn realizes that Martine was Nathan's 13th clone and the first success, having murdered the other copies and buried them. Martine aims to use Nathan's clone's kill switch but Evelyn convinces her to use the 12th corpse to fake her death, leaving their child with Nathan before leaving."

In 
The Unlimited Dream Company
, a man named Blake crashes a stolen aircraft into the 
River Thames
 outside the Surrey suburb of 
Shepperton
.
[
1
]
 Whether he survives the crash, to become a sort of supernatural messiah for the small town, or if he actually drowns, and dying, imagines the whole thing, is never truly revealed.
[
2
]
 Contradictory hints are scattered throughout the novel which may support both interpretations.

Since the story is told by Blake in the first person, we know what he wants us to know, and we are only told what he chooses to tell us. In the first chapter of the novel, where Blake outlines his life before the air accident, there are elements that may make us suspect that he is insane, so that he is an absolutely 
unreliable narrator
.

Blake has extraordinary powers: he can fly, heal sick people, 
phagocytize
 other people whenever he likes; but he cannot leave the suburbs, though he repeatedly tries to get away. Moreover, Blake is obsessed by the relic of the small 
Cessna
 aircraft that he crash-landed in, which has been left submerged in the Thames. This might support the hypothesis that he is dead and is only imagining the strange events of the story.

However, there is a crucial moment when Blake, who is about to absorb all the citizens of Shepperton in order to gain energy to escape the suburb, is shot by Stark, another loner who manages a rickety zoo. The wound triggers a deep inner change in the character, who gets rid of his cannibalistic drives and becomes more human and compassionate. He then helps other people to escape Shepperton, and remains there alone, waiting for the return of the woman he loves, Miriam St. Cloud.

As well as the protagonist's name, the novel draws on the works of 
William Blake
,
[
3
]
 particularly his epic work 
Milton: A Poem
[
4
]
 in other ways. The surreal descriptions of Shepperton's transformation are drawn in part from William Blake's psychogeographical descriptions of London, while the final confrontation between Blake and the corpse of the drowned pilot (which he comes to realise is himself) echoes that between Milton and Satan at the end of 
Milton a Poem

As 1943 begins, the Race attempts to consolidate its hold over 
Latin America
, 
Africa
, and 
Australia
 while it is engaged in a fierce struggle with the advanced nations of the world: the 
United States
, the 
United Kingdom
, the 
Soviet Union
, 
Japan
, and 
Nazi Germany
. While capable of resisting the invaders, mankind has been dealt a heavy blow by the nemesis from the stars. The Race maintains its unquestioned 
air supremacy
 over the entire world as humans are reduced to moving their ground forces by night and using their own aircraft only in the direst emergencies. With supplies of 
petroleum
 severely limited, people have taken to using 
horse-driven
 
carriages
 to replace 
automobiles
 and 
kerosene lamps
 to replace 
electric lights
. But even as the human race huddles in the darkness, physicists and engineers work desperately to develop the first human atomic bombs, which represent what might be the only hope of driving the Race off Earth.

After a rapid conquest of 
Spain
 and 
Portugal
 and the capitulation of 
Italy
, the Race focuses on driving its forces in France eastward, toward the heart of the German Reich. Among the officers of the 
Wehrmacht
 struggling desperately to hold back the tide of the alien forces is Colonel Heinrich Jäger. Fresh from his stay in Hitler's 
Berchtesgaden
 retreat, Jäger is puzzled by the relationship he has formed with Senior Lieutenant Ludmila Gorbunova, the Ukrainian pilot who flew Soviet Foreign Minister 
Vyacheslav Molotov
 to 
Bavaria
 for a conference with the 
Führer
. He is much enamoured with her but wonders if love can develop between two former enemies.

Jäger is given command of a 
panzer
 regiment near 
Belfort
 and is charged with keeping the Race from reaching the 
Rhine
. Although the latest panzer models, the 
Panther
 and the 
Tiger I
, give the Germans a fighting chance, they are still woefully inferior to the Race's 
landcruisers
. For their part, the aliens are stunned that humans are capable of designing and deploying new tank models within such a short space of time, as the Race's rate of technological development is centuries slower. Jäger is abruptly pulled out of frontline service and ordered to assist the German atomic bomb program in 
Wittelsbach
.

In the United States, Jens Larssen, a physicist, leaves 
Chicago
 in search of the metallurgical laboratory that has relocated to 
Denver
. After crossing the 
Great Lakes
, he moves swiftly across 
Minnesota
 and the 
Dakotas
. Larssen is not so much driven by the need to hasten atomic bomb development as he is by a desire to be reunited with his wife, Barbara. Unfortunately for Jens, under the impression that he is dead, Barbara has started a relationship with Corporal Sam Yeager, a soldier responsible for guarding captured alien prisoners of war. Yeager serves as a translator for the metallurgical lab since he has learned the rudiments of the Race's language. Jens arrives in Denver before the lab and sends a courier out to find Barbara with a message that he remains alive. Barbara learns that her husband is still alive just after she revealed to Yeager that she is pregnant.

In 
Illinois
, after the successful drive by 
Patton
 that liberated much of the state, the Race begins to advance upon Chicago once more. US soldiers fight valiantly, but the flat open country gives the alien landcruisers a decisive advantage. Slowly but surely, the Race draws closer and closer toward 
Lake Michigan
.

Jäger manages to return to the front lines in Belfort after an unproductive stay with German physicists working on atomic research in Wittelsbach. Not long afterwards, Wittelsbach is destroyed by an out-of-control nuclear reaction produced by 
Nazi
 scientists. The resulting 
nuclear meltdown
 alerts the Race to the virtual certainty that Germany is engaged in 
nuclear research
.

It is not alone. On Stalin's behalf, Molotov visits a secret research laboratory several miles north of 
Moscow
 that has Soviet researchers struggling to turn the sample of 
plutonium
 that had been captured by German-Soviet forces in Ukraine the year before into an atomic device. They have minimal success and Molotov attempts to encourage them with threats of torture and death if they fail. That produces no marked improvement in the advances made by Soviet engineers.

In Japan, a captured 
killercraft
 pilot of the Race, Teerts, is interrogated by Japanese researchers attempting to understand the dynamics of 
nuclear fission
. As a pilot, Teerts claims to have limited knowledge of atomic weapons, as he drops them, not builds them. The Japanese refuse to believe him and use 
torture
 to make Teerts more cooperative.

In the United States, the metallurgical laboratory finally reaches Denver and begins working on atomic research. Its work is helped by a small shipment of plutonium that Colonel Leslie Groves brings from 
Boston
, where a British 
submarine
 had been entrusted with delivering it to the US government. The plutonium is one-fourth of the material stolen from the Race during the German-Soviet operation in 
Ukraine
. It had come into the possession of the British by way of Jewish partisans, who had commandeered a portion of the plutonium consigned to Germany when they briefly held Colonel Jäger in captivity in 
Poland
 the previous winter. Unfortunately, the plutonium in question is not enough to build an 
atomic bomb
. The metallurgical lab must produce a substantial amount of the precious plutonium before Americans can hope to wield a nuclear device in the war against the Race.

Jens Larssen meets with his wife upon her arrival in Denver and learns that she has married and become impregnated by Corporal Sam Yeager. In a difficult decision that leaves everyone emotionally upset, she decides to keep the baby and to remain with Yeager. Jens takes the news badly, and his work on the atomic bomb project suffers. To keep him out of trouble, Groves orders Larssen to travel to 
Hanford
 and to consider the possibility of transferring the metallurgical lab there to facilitate the production of plutonium. With an 
M1903 Springfield rifle
 slung over his shoulder, Jens heads off to Washington State on a bicycle.

Jäger, supervising the efforts to recover plutonium from the melted-down reactor in Wittelsbach, is recruited by SS 
Standartenführer
 
Otto Skorzeny
 to help take back the city of 
Split
 from the Race, who have been offering the 
Independent State of Croatia
 incentives to turn away from the Germans and toward them. It is also an effort to lure Skorzeny into Split to be killed. However, Skorzeny and Jäger, with superior maps, dig a tunnel into the middle of the Race's garrison, and, with numerous Croat soldiers and 
FG 42
 battle rifles, which are superior to the Race's infantry weapons, completely reduce the garrison. Every member of the Race in Split is either killed or taken prisoner. Among the dead is Fleetlord Atvar's chief intelligence officer, Drefsab.

As the summer of 1943 begins, forces of the Race creep closer to Germany and have reached the outskirts of Chicago. Moscow appears to be on the brink of collapse when the Race advance is abruptly stopped by the human detonation of an atomic bomb, planted as a 
landmine
, between 
Kaluga
 and Moscow. The story ends with the balance of power in the scope of the conflict dramatically redefined."

Fang Runin (""Rin"") is a war orphan in the Nikan Empire whose foster parents employ her in their 
opium
 smuggling. She secretly studies for a national test to escape an arranged marriage and places first in her province, which sends her north to Sinegard, the imperial capital and home of the military academy.

Mocked for being a poor southerner, Rin excels in her studies. She becomes friends with Chen Kitay, the son of a minister, and enemies with Yin Nezha, the son of one of the twelve regional warlords. She also looks up to the school's star student, Altan Trengsin, who is from the island of Speer. Speerly soldiers served the empire by wielding shamanic fire powers from their god, the 
Phoenix
, until being massacred by the Mugen Federation in a previous war. Rin attracts the attention of Master Jiang, who develops her talent for 
shamanism
. She wins the first year tournament over Nezha, is enthralled by the appearance of the empress Su Daji at a festival, and is taught by Jiang how to access the magic of the gods via meditation and 
psychedelic drugs
.

In her third year, the Mugen Federation invades Nikan and seeks to capture Sinegard. Master Jiang disappears after using shamanistic powers to summon monsters to bring down the gate that Rin and Nezha were defending on the Mugenese army. In the aftermath, Rin faints after using the power of the Phoenix to immolate an enemy general who impaled Nezha, which prompts a Mugenese retreat. Rin learns she is a Speerly, and to avoid the warlords fighting over her, she is selected to join the Cike, a misfit unit of mostly-shaman imperial assassins now led by Altan.

The Cike are sent to the southern port city of Kurdalain, where despite a successful strike on Mugenese reinforcements, Rin struggles to access the Phoenix. She reunites with Nezha who apologises to her for his treatment of her in Sinegard, and they kill one of the monsters released by Jiang. After prolonged street fighting, Altan become disillusioned and Nezha is lost during a Mugenese 
chemical attack
. The Cike realize that the Kurdalain siege is a feint and travel to the wartime capital of Golyn Niis to find the city destroyed and its inhabitants massacred by the Mugenese. Sifting through the wreckage, they discover Kitay, who informs them that the empress had fled the city before the massacre, and Venka, Rin's former roommate, who was raped and begs Rin to avenge her.

Altan decides that the only way to win the war is to unleash former members of the Cike who are entombed alive after going mad in a mountain prison where their powers are suppressed. Having gotten approval from the empress, Altan sets off with Rin. There, they find Jiang who had imprisoned himself after losing control of his power. He refuses to help them and accuses Altan of only wanting revenge for his people. After releasing Feylen, a former Cike with wind powers, nearly results in Altan's death, the pair decide to leave but are captured by a Mugenese ambush.

Rin and Altan are taken to a Mugenese science facility and experimented on with opium. They learn that the empress had sold out Nikan and betrayed their mission for her own life. The opium helps Rin awaken her power and Altan sacrifices himself as a diversion for Rin to escape the mainland to go to Speer. There she finds the Phoenix's temple, channels the god's unlimited fire, and destroys the primary island of the Mugenese homeland. In the aftermath, Rin awakens on a ship crewed by the Cike and Kitay, who is horrified by what she has done. She learns that Altan named her Cike commander and vows to use her newfound powers to take revenge on the empress for her treachery."

Valeria watches the launch of the 
Peerless
 from the home world, waiting for its return. Six generations later, a suitable time has come to turn the ship around. A solution for the home world is in sight. But the crew is split into two fractions, one wanting to continue the mission and one instead wanting to find a new home in the orthogonal cluster. After a vote is held, the 
Peerless
 turns around and (with an inverted 
arrow of time
) begins the long voyage home. Agata talks with Medoro about the new possibility of using the inverted light of orthogonal stars to send messages back in time, but a discussion only parts the 
Peerless
 further. After a vote in favor of the system, a bomb kills the group responsible for its construction, including Medoro. Some strongly against it like Ramiro are imprisoned. Meanwhile, the discovery of an inhabitable world called Esilio in the orthogonal cluster seems to pose a solution to the conflict, but time is running backwards there. A journey to Esilio is planned. Examining light bent by the gravity of its sun could also verify Lila's theory (corresponding to 
General relativity
).

Agata, Ramiro, Tarquinia and Azelio fly to Esilio with the 
Surveyor
 using an orthogonal course just like the 
Peerless
. Twelve years will pass for them while only four years will pass on board the 
Peerless
. After reaching Esilio, Lila's theory is confirmed. On the surface, they have to deal with many odd consequences of the opposite arrow of time, including having to detonate a rock to enforce their own onto the soil to make their plants grow. Agata finds a message carved into a stone in the crater, which is from the ancestors giving them their gratitude from when Esilio flew past the home world. They fly back with the knowledge of the ultimate success of the grand mission of the 
Peerless
.

When approaching the 
Peerless
, they learn of the successful construction of the messaging system. Everything about their journey is already common knowledge. Contrary to expectation, the system has blocked any new innovation. But it will completely shut down in a while with no hint at a reason sent back before. The crew discusses about a manual shutdown or manipulation being better than a complete destruction of the 
Peerless
 by a collision (if it could be averted at all) and build probes to obstruct the orthogonal stars in front of the cameras. After their arrival back on board, they learn about the still ongoing division of society with some thinking the shutdown will be a trick. Agata and Ramiro both learn of a plan to destroy the cameras (which use light from the entire othogonal cluster, rendering bare obstruction impossible) by detonations from space by Giacomo, who used the messaging system he despises nonetheless to plan ahead knowing about the probes of the 
Surveyor
 and Agata's condition (whose future self still doesn't agree to the current plan) to even abandon it in the last moment if she finds a less dangerous solution. Ramiro admits to Agata to have send Tarquinia to carve the message on Esilio, which therefore isn't from the ancestors and doesn't guarantee a safe future. Shortly before the disruption, Agata realizes that flooding the cameras with ordinary light can also cause a signal loss and heads out into space to move the bombs. The disruption takes place with only minor destruction and Agata survives injured. Tarquinia admits to Agata and Ramiro that she just couldn't uncarve the message on Esilio, which therefore was in fact from the ancestors. Agata tells them about the destruction of the messaging system having lifted the block on innovation with the recent one explaining how their entire existence is even possible.

One year after the departure of the 
Peerless
 from the home world, Valeria is woken up by screams as the sun has turned dark. Together with Eusebio and Silvio, she is brought to Clara, a traveler from the 
Peerless
 taking them into space. The 
Peerless
 flew another loop to arrive three years earlier (and also passed by itself on its former course). The sun (which in this universe is a burning rock) was extinguished and gigantic thrusters based on the 
eternal flame
 are now build on it to accelerate the entire system (through gravity) onto a parallel course with the Hurtlers, rendering them harmless. The destroyed Gemma will continue to provide light. Clara also shares insight into their society where males and females have been fused together and which prefers to stay on the 
Peerless
 and the far side of the sun. Valeria plans to come for a visit, but is saddened by the fact that she wouldn't be able to express her gratitude for past generations. Clara thinks that there will surely be a way.

The story follows a novelist on an island under the control of the Memory Police. An unknown force causes the people of the island to collectively 'forget' and lose their attachment to objects or concepts, e.g. hats, perfume, birds and ribbon. As the inhabitants move on from the disappearances, the Memory Police enforce the removal of the disappeared objects from the island. The people who continue to remember, such as the author's mother, attempt to escape from the island or hide in safe houses to evade capture by the Police.

R, the author's editor, reveals himself to be one of those who still remembers the disappeared objects, and fears that he will be taken by the Memory Police. With the help of an old man, a family friend, the protagonist arranges and hides R in a secret room in her home. While hiding, R then tries to help them recall some of the long disappeared objects to the author and the old man, though to no avail.

As the calendars disappear, the winter continues and spring never comes. Food is becoming scarce on the island. The Memory Police raid the author's house as they celebrate the old man's birthday, but fail to discover the secret room, leaving them free. Subsequently, novels disappear as well, and the protagonist works as a typist. On R's insistence, she continues to work on her novel and keeps some books. After an earthquake, some of her mother's sculptures, given back by a family friend, break and reveal more objects that had disappeared, including a ferry ticket and a 
harmonica
. She decides to investigate her mother's cabin, which R believes contains more objects that have long disappeared. The author, along with the old man, manage to retrieve the objects and hide them in her home.

One day, the old man dies from a 
brain hemorrhage
. Soon after, the inhabitants are made to forget some of their body parts, with the Memory Police capturing those who continue to retain their sense of the ""disappeared"" body parts. The author, despite much difficulty, manages to finish her novel of a love story that took a dark turn. The inhabitants, including the author, slowly began to accept their fate as they forget their own existence and vanish. Before disappearing, the author reassures R that he will be able to come out of hiding along with others who manage to preserve their memories."

 destroys most of the United States as magic returns to the world. 
Dinétah
 becomes an independent nation. Certain 
Navajo
 people develop 
clan powers
 based on their ancestral tribes.

On Maggie Hoskie's sixteenth birthday, her grandmother is murdered by witches and monsters. This traumatic event activates her clan powers, giving Maggie 
superhuman speed
 and a propensity for killing. She attracts the attention of the immortal monster-slayer Neizghání and becomes his apprentice. Neizghání trains her in the art of combat, but abandons her when he perceives that she is becoming too violent. Maggie becomes a 
bounty hunter
 and monster-slayer. She seeks information about a new breed of monster from Tah, a local 
medicine man
. Tah tells her that the monster was created by a powerful witch. He asks her to work with his grandson Kai Arviso, who also possesses clan powers, to destroy the witch.

Maggie and Kai retrieve information about a relic known as a ""fire drill"", which may be related to the monsters. She is visited by Mąʼii, the 
Coyote
; Mąʼii tells her that the drill belongs to Mósí, a cat goddess. He also requests that she complete a task for him, giving her magical rings. Tah's 
hogan
 burns down; Maggie suspects Neizghání. In the carnage, Maggie and Kai kill a corrupt police officer. They seek shelter with Grace Goodacre, a local bar owner. Maggie, Kai, and Grace's children begin working together.

Mósí promises to give the fire drill to the winner of a duel. Maggie agrees and is ordered to fight Neizghání. He brands her and almost kills her, but she is rescued by Kai. Maggie seeks revenge against Neizghání, believing him to be responsible for the death of Tah and the creation of the monsters. They return to 
Black Mesa
, where Maggie last saw Neizghání.

As Kai and the Goodacres are ambushed by monsters on Black Mesa, Mąʼii appears and reveals to Maggie that he controls the monsters. He was responsible for the murder of her grandmother, leading to the activation of her clan powers; he was also responsible for Maggie's duel with Neizghání. He wants to forge Maggie into a powerful warrior. Furious at this revelation, Maggie kills him and returns to the battlefield, where Neizghání has defeated the monsters and is now threatening Kai, whom he considers to be a rival. Neizghání offers Maggie a choice: fight and die now, or betray Kai and return to him. Maggie kills Kai, believing that his clan powers will resurrect him. She then uses Mąʼii's rings to bind Neizghání, temporarily incapacitating him and removing his powers. At Maggie's trailer, Tah and Maggie wait for Kai to return."

In a school in Virginia, children are taught the art of persuasion instead of usual subjects. They learn in detail how to handle the power of language to control other individuals by breaking them down into psychographic markers. The most successful students graduate and join a nameless, powerful and secretive organization whose members are called ""poets"". This society believes that revealing one's identities and feelings is extremely dangerous because it can make the mind susceptible to manipulation.

Emily Ruff, a witty orphan from San Francisco, is recruited by members of the organization and taken to the school. After passing the strange and rigorous entrance exams, she is taught the fundamentals of persuasion by Bronte, Eliot, and Lowell, who have adopted pseudonyms to conceal their true identities. Emily gradually becomes a prodigy in the school, until she commits the fatal mistake of falling in love.

Wil Parke, an apparently innocent man, is ambushed by two men in an airport bathroom, who claim that he is the key to a secret war between rival factions of poets. Wil eventually discovers that his entire past is a lie and must travel to the decimated town of Broken Hill, Australia to uncover the truth about who he is.

At the point in which Emily's and Wil's narratives conjoin, the shocking plot of the poets is revealed in full, the number of deaths increases, and the world nears a crisis event in which all language will become meaningless."

In the present day, narrated in 
second-person
, Harrowhark Nonagesimus discovers that her ascension to Lyctorhood
[
a
]
 was imperfect. John, Emperor of the Nine Houses, nevertheless fulfils his promise to renew her House, waking several hundred new citizens from cryogenic sleep. He explains the nature of Lyctorhood, which he has obscured from the Houses. John resurrected humanity from cataclysm by impossibly powerful necromancy, inadvertently spawning Resurrection Beasts, the ghosts of the dead planets, that hunt Lyctors. Fellow Lyctor Ianthe Tridentarius gives Harrow a series of instructive sealed letters she seemingly penned to herself, though does not explain why.

In alternating chapters, portrayed in 
third-person
, Harrow recounts events that directly contradict those of 
Gideon the Ninth
. Instead of Gideon, her cavalier is Ortus Nigenad, who is occupied with the epic poem 
The Noniad.
 She reveals to him that she is insane: in both past and present, she is missing large portions of her memory, and she hallucinates ""the Body"", the beautiful woman she saw in the Locked Tomb as a child.

In the past, arriving at Canaan House, Teacher informs the heirs and cavaliers that there is a beast lying in the heart of the facility called “the Sleeper.” Except for Harrow and Ianthe, every character who died in the events of 
Gideon the Ninth
 survives in this account and vice versa.

In the present day, Harrow is taken to the Emperor's space station, the Mithraeum. John reveals he and his Lyctors have been fighting Resurrection Beasts for millennia; most have been lost to madness or battle. The survivors are a vicious and embittered Mercymorn, a flippant Augustine and a stoic, relentless Ortus, who attempts to kill Harrow multiple times, deeming her a threat.

Harrow and Ianthe are taught how to travel to the River, an otherworldly afterlife, which in addition to providing 
faster-than-light
 travel allows them to defeat the Resurrection Beasts by destroying their 
astral bodies
. The Lyctoral process is fundamental to this: the echo of the consumed cavalier's soul controls the physical body to ensure its survival. Both Harrow and Ianthe struggle with this. Harrow helps Ianthe replace her once-severed sword arm with that of its gilded skeleton.

The Lyctors prepare to battle the nearest Beast, killing planets to prevent it feeding. On one such mission, Harrow encounters Camilla Hect, whom she believed dead. She in fact works for ""Blood of Eden,"" a terrorist organization seeking to foil the Empire's 
colonialist
 ambitions, led by the mysterious Commander Wake. She helps Harrow learn that Palamedes (to whom she was cavalier) is not truly dead; his spirit is sequestered in a tiny bubble inside the River.

Harrow learns that the Canaan House of her supposed past is a similar such bubble: those present other than Harrow are the souls of the dead from the real events of 
Gideon the Ninth
. Prior to writing the letters, she requested Ianthe perform brain surgery to obscure her memories of Gideon, ensuring her soul could not truly be absorbed. The spirits make a last-ditch attempt to fight the Sleeper by summoning Matthias Nonius, legendary 
Noniad
 swordsman. They kill the Sleeper, who is unmasked as the ghost of Commander Wake. Marta, Protesilaus and Ortus resolve to follow Matthias into the River to face the Beast alongside ""Ortus"" the First, whose name is in fact Gideon the First. Abigail and Magnus, Fifth House necromancer and cavalier, tell Harrow to return to her life, but she is unable, hallucinating a variety of alternate universes.

It is revealed that the second person perspective was not stylistic but narrated by Gideon Nav, who awakens in Harrow's body. Alongside the remaining Lyctors she makes her way to the Emperor's chambers; he is failing to interrogate Wake, who has possessed the corpse of the Lyctor Cytherea. Surprised by Gideon Nav's presence, Mercymorn and Augustine reveal a long-anticipated plan known as 
dios apate
: using 
semen stolen
 from John, Wake 
artificially inseminated
 herself. The child was intended as a bomb to breach the Locked Tomb, releasing its prisoner: Alecto, John's cavalier, whose ""perfect lyctorhood"" gave him limitless power while preserving her life. The plan failed, and the Emperor's child survived as Gideon herself.

Mercymorn destroys John's body, but he effortlessly returns and kills her, shedding his affable persona and demanding fealty from all Lyctors but the non-present Harrow. Augustine throws the Mithraeum itself into the River, but Ianthe intervenes to save John, dooming Augustine. As they fight to escape, it is revealed that Gideon the First died fighting the Beast, allowing his compartmentalised cavalier, Pyrrha Dve, to take permanent control. Still in a vision of the Locked Tomb where she first met the Body, Harrow climbs into the empty coffin and falls unconscious again. Six months in the future, an unknown person awakens in an apartment in an unnamed city with Camilla Hect.

 against the Ousters. Father de Soya finds the murder of Ouster children unconscionable, and he mutinies.

On Old Earth, Aenea becomes a teacher, instructing others about ""the Void which Binds"". When she is sixteen, Aenea tells Raul to leave Earth and retrieve the Consul's ship. On God's Grove, three cyborgs retrieve Radamanth Nemes. The four almost catch up with Raul, but they are intercepted by the Shrike. Raul finds the Consul's ship. Travel to the 
Buddhist
 planet T'ien Shan creates a 5-year 
time debt
, and Aenea is 21 when she and Raul reunite.

On T'ien Shan, Raul becomes Aenea's lover. Aenea reveals that many people on the planets she has visited have taken 
communion
 from her. People who take this communion undergo several changes due to the virus she carries, including gaining the ability to access the Void which Binds and losing the ability to carry a cruciform.

Aenea tells Raul that during their separation, she married someone and had a child; they lived together for two years. Raul is heartbroken. Aenea transfers the Consul's ship away from T'ien Shan through freecasting, using the Void to travel without a portal. They travel to an Ouster 
Dyson Sphere

 takes place on the planet Ishtar in the ""Anubelea"" system, located 300 
parsecs
 away from the Sun. Ishtar's peculiar orbit around the three stars of the Anubelea system (Bel, Ea, and Anu) results in the ""Fire Time"", a dramatic increase in heat every thousand years as the ""demon star"" Anu approaches the planet. As the northern hemisphere heats up, large numbers of Ishtarians flee south, leading to a collapse of civilization. The northern natives (Valennen) take advantage of the Gathering's (southern natives) culture to win two victories in Valennen territory.  The presence of visitors from Earth (also engaged in their own war off-planet at Nasqua) raises the prospect of changing the dynamics of history, though, with Earth involved in an interstellar war of its own, human aid is not guaranteed.

Software designer Scott Warden is living with his family in early twenty-first century 
Thailand
 after his latest contract has ended. He and his friend Hitch Paley are among the first to find an enormous 
monolith
 which appears out of nowhere in the jungle. On closer examination, it is found to be a monument made of a mysterious, indestructible substance. It bears an inscription commemorating a military victory by someone named ""Kuin"", presumably an 
Asian
 warlord—twenty years in the future.

Over the next twenty years, increasingly grand monuments to Kuin continue to appear—first in Asia, then in much of the rest of the world. Pro-Kuin and anti-Kuin political movements spring up, leading to the rise of economic problems, fatalistic 
cults
, and open war.

Scott has become entangled with his former teacher and mentor Sue Chopra, a scientist who has assembled a team of fellow researchers to investigate the chronoliths and learn to predict their appearances. With Sue's team, Scott witnesses a new chronolith that appears in 
Jerusalem
.

Kaitlin, his daughter, becomes caught up in the hysteria and joins a pro-Kuin youth cult; while trying to find her, Scott meets Ashlee, a single mother whose son Adam Mills joined the same cult. This leads to Scott and his companions being on hand to witness yet another chronolith appearance in 
Mexico
 in which Adam apparently dies. Scott quits his work with Sue and marries Ashlee, trying to live a normal life. 

Sue Chopra comes to believe that Kuin has made the chronoliths in order to inspire fear and defeatism, making the future victories inevitable by gaining support ahead of time. In an effort to fight Kuin's growing influence, she uses the revelation that Adam is alive and leading a Kuin worshipper group to recruit Scott back into her work, with the plan to destroy the first chronolith predicted to appear in the United States.

The chronolith appears, but shortly after, it self-destructs, apparently sabotaged by a maker who exceeded the limits of the technology.

A militant faction led by Adam Mills attacks their base of operations, takes Chopra hostage, and menaces Scott's family. Before allowing herself to be taken hostage, Sue entrusts Scott with a secret: she believes it's her fate to be made prisoner in order to be able to sabotage this chronolith. After this, a twenty year-long war ensues. While no physical Kuin ever appears to led the factions fighting on his name, Scott finds out by chance that Adam's middle name was Quinn, which may hint to him being the closest to a real Kuin. 

Scott lives to see the collapse of the Kuinist movement and a scientific renaissance sparked by Chopra's chronolith research. At the end of the story he and Kaitlin watch the launch of an interstellar probe that seems to be based on this research."

 Bureau of Standards and that she is recruiting him for a physical survey of the future via a secretly constructed ""TDV"" or 
time displacement vehicle
.  When Chaney demurs, she informs him that his contract has been purchased from the 
think tank
 where he works, leaving him little choice.

The reluctant Chaney travels to a military installation south of 
Joliet, Illinois
. There he is teamed with two diversely talented military officers, 
United States Air Force
 Major William Moresby and 
United States Navy
 Lieutenant Commander Arthur Saltus. Chaney soon finds that he shares with Saltus an attraction to Kathryn, who is their civilian liaison, but unlike Saltus, Chaney lacks the assertiveness to pursue her aggressively. Instead he focuses his attention on the project, which is soon ordered by the President of the United States to embark on their first mission, a trip two years into the future to discover whether he wins the 
1980 presidential election
.

The three travel to the Thursday after the election on individual trips, with first Moresby and then Saltus going first according to military seniority. Chaney, as a civilian, is the last to leave, but arrives earlier than the others due to a temporal navigation instrument error. They discover that the president, whom Chaney despises as a weak man (in fact, his name is given as ""President Meeks""), wins the election in a landslide as a result of his successful handling of ongoing 
race riots
 in Chicago, and that these riots have resulted in the building of a wall down the middle of 
Cermak Road
 dividing the north of the city from the south. They also learn that the nation is under 
martial law
 after a failed attempt by the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff
 to take over the government by 
coup d'état
, one thwarted because of the advance knowledge the time travelers will bring back of it. While preparing for their return, Saltus informs Chaney of an additional discovery: a marriage license between him and Kathryn. Chaney concedes to the gloating Saltus.

With the success of the initial mission, the three are authorized to travel further into the future. They plan to travel to dates of their own choosing within the coming two decades, with each trip to be separated by approximately a year in order to provide broader coverage.

Moresby goes first and travels to July 4, 1999 (""It has significance, after all!"" he says), only to emerge in the middle of a racial civil war in which Chicago had recently been attacked with a 
nuclear bomb
 launched from China on behalf of 
black guerrillas
. Quickly getting involved in a battle between base troops and invading ""ramjets"", as the 
black guerrillas
 are called, Moresby dies in an attack on a ramjet 
mortar
 position.

Saltus is the next to go, traveling to the date of his 50th birthday in 2000. Upon arrival, he discovers remnants of the battle, and is nearly killed by survivors hiding out on the base. Wounded, he is assisted back to the displacement vehicle by an unknown figure and returns to the present, taking with him a tape-recorded report that Moresby had made upon his arrival.

Forewarned by Saltus's experience, Chaney travels further into the future. Not having chosen a date, and disillusioned by his experiences on the 1980 trip, he arrives at an indeterminate point in ""2000-plus"", by which time the power from the base's 
nuclear reactor
 has been disrupted, causing the chronometers set up for the travelers to shut down. Venturing outside, he finds the base to be long-neglected, apart from a 
cistern
 and a grave. While further investigating the grave (that of Saltus), he is approached by a young man and a woman who identify themselves as Arthur and Kathryn's children. They take Chaney to Kathryn, now elderly, who reveals that civilization collapsed as an indirect result of the time travel project; with the information from the future, the president made a series of disastrous decisions that led to war with China, followed by the civil war and societal destruction. When Chaney asks how much of this information he reports, she informs him that he reported none of it, that with the loss of power the time displacement vehicle can no longer return to the past and that Chaney is trapped in the future.

Although it is foreshadowed earlier in the book, only at this point is the reader explicitly told a fact that makes Chaney's predicament all the more tragic. He is black, the only such member of the project. ""Everyone fears you; no one will trust you since the rebellion,"" Kathryn tells him. ""I am the only one here who does not fear a black man."""

During World War II, Simon Tregarth rose from a common soldier in the 
U.S. Army
 to the rank of lieutenant colonel.  In post-war Berlin, he became involved, almost accidentally, in the 
black market
, only to be caught and discharged in disgrace from the Army. He later also managed to anger a powerful criminal organization enough for it to send assassins after him. After months on the run, killing at least two of these assassins, he knows his time is running out.

Then Tregarth is contacted by Dr. Jorge Petronius, a man with an amazing reputation for hiding men in dire straits. Petronius recounts a fantastic tale of a stone of power, the 
Siege Perilous
 of 
Arthurian legend
, that has the power to open a gateway to a world attuned to the person who sits on it. Disbelieving, but with little to lose, Tregarth gives him all the money he has left, and is transported to a land where magic vies with more mundane swords and bows.

He arrives in a nearly empty countryside, just in time to witness a savage hunt: a lone woman being chased down by hounds followed by two horsemen. Tregarth rescues the woman, who he much later learns is a witch named Jaelithe, and enters the service of her homeland Estcarp, a land ruled by witches and threatened by many enemies. One of these enemies is the land of Gorm, which was bloodily taken over by the far-off, mysterious realm of Kolder.

Estcarp's sole trusted ally is a nation of seafaring traders, the Sulcarmen. When Magnis Osberic, leader of the Sulcarmen, requests help at their citadel, Sulcarkeep, Tregarth and Jaelithe are among those sent to its aid. On the way, they are ambushed by, but defeat, men who appear to be mind-controlled by some unseen entity. Afterwards, Koris, a refugee from Gorm and now Estcarp's Captain, recognizes some of the bodies as men of Gorm. The group reaches the island fortress of Sulcarkeep, but most of the Sulcarmen are away in the season of trading, and an attack including troops coming from the air overwhelms the few defenders. While a handful of survivors flee in small boats, Osberic remains behind to blow up Sulcarkeep, taking many of the enemy with him.

The violence of the explosion causes the tiny vessels to founder; Tregarth and Jaelithe both reach land, but are separated. Jaelithe is captured by Fulk of Verlaine, a coastal lord, but then helped to escape by Loyse, his daughter. Together, the two women make their way to Kars, capital of Estcarp's restive southern neighbor Karsten. Tregarth, guided by a mental link with the witch, is reunited with her there.

Soon afterwards, Karsten erupts in a frenzy of killing targeting those of the Old Race, the principal ethnic group of Estcarp. Tregarth, Jaelithe, Koris and Loyse flee the carnage. Tregarth organizes a guerrilla force, drawing on his military experience, but is caught and shipped to Gorm to be turned into a mindless slave, like those encountered on the way to Sulcarkeep. Fortunately, he is able to escape.

The witches of Estcarp launch an attack on Gorm's capital city. When Tregarth fights and kills the enemy leader, during the intense struggle, he inadvertently achieves a mental rapport with his opponent and learns that the people of Kolder are like him in some respects; they are a small number of soldiers, refugees from another universe, though one with a higher level of technology than Earth. Estcarp is victorious, but the threat from Kolder remains.

The story is concluded in the sequel, 
Web of the Witch World
, which with 
Witch World
 makes one complete story."

Main article: 
Darkover series


The story, told from the alternating points of view of Regis Hastur and Lewis Alton, starts from the storyline of Regis Hastur.

While riding from Nevarsin to Thendera, Regis Hastur's party encounters Kennard Alton and his sons, Lewis and Marius. Lew introduces Regis to Danilo Syrtis. They ride to Comyn Castle.

When Kennard is injured by a fall, Lew takes over as captain of the guard. He objects to Dyan Ardais being named Cadet Master, because of rumors that Ardais is a pederast and sadist. Kennard overrules his son, saying that the rumors were unfounded.

Members of the Comyn Council meet with the Terran Legate regarding rumors that forbidden weapons are being sold in the city of Caer Donn. The Comyn claim that this is a breach of both the Compact (Darkovan tradition concerning weapons) and of the Terran Empire's treaty with the council. The Terrans claim that Aldaran is essentially a separate country, so different laws apply. The matter is unresolved. Kennard suggests instead that Lew make a diplomatic journey to Aldaran.

Danilo Syrtis is thrown out of the guard for drawing a sword on Cadet Master Ardais. Lew suspects that Ardais has been making sexual advances towards Danilo, but is unable to prove it. Broken, Danilo departs for the Syrtis estate, where Regis later confronts him. After an argument, Danilo reveals the details of Dyan Ardais' attempt to rape him, both physically and telepathically. Regis persuades Danilo to bring charges against Ardais.

Lew arrives at the city of Caer Donn and Aldaran Castle, where he meets Kermiac, Lord Aldaran, who explain's Lew's Aldaran family connections. Lew is introduced to his cousin, Beltran, and Lord Aldaran's foster children, Marjorie, Thyra and Rafe Scott, and the mysterious Robert Kadarin. He learns they have been experimenting with matrix technologies. Lew is drawn in, without realizing the dangers, and agrees to help train them. Lew later discovers that Kadarin has acquired Sharra, an ancient and dangerously powerful matrix. Kermiac Aldaran dies as a result of the Sharra Matrix experiments, largely due to a mistake made by the increasingly insane Thyra.

Beltran kidnaps Danilo and tries to force him to join, but Danilo refuses. Regis arrives on horseback in search of Danilo, and depart on horseback after Kermiac Aldaran's funeral. Lew heads to Arillinn with Marjorie Scott, but Beltran's guard return them to Aldaran. Kadarin's experiments result in the destruction of Caer Donn, which Lew had foreseen. Lew attempts to control the Sharra matrix, and he, with the help of Arillinn, is saved. Marjorie Scott dies of her injuries.

The Terrans agree to honor the Compact throughout Darkover, now understanding its true purpose. Dyan Ardais makes amends to Danilo Syrtis by naming Danilo the heir to the Ardais Domain. Regis pledges his life to the service of Darkover. Lew Alton leaves Darkover, taking the Sharra Matrix with him."

In the first book, a wealthy arms manufacturer, Dr. Baines, comes to a black magician, Theron Ware. Initially Baines tests Ware's credentials by asking for two people to be killed, first the Governor of California, Rogan (
Reagan
 was governor at the time of writing) and then a rival physicist. When this is accomplished to Baines' satisfaction, Baines reveals his real plan: he wishes to release all the demons from Hell on Earth for one night to see what might happen. The book includes a long sequence of the summoning ritual and the demons as they appear. Tension between 
white magicians
 (who appear to have a line of communications with the unfallen host in Heaven) and Ware is woven over the terms and conditions of a magical covenant that is designed to provide for observers and limitations. 
Black Easter
 ends with 
Baphomet
 announcing to the participants that the demons cannot be compelled to return to Hell: the war is over and 
God
 is dead.

The Day After Judgment
, which follows in the series, develops and extends the characters from the first book. It suggests that God might not be dead, or that demons might not be inherently self-destructive, as something appears to be restraining the actions of the demons upon Earth. In a lengthy 
Miltonian
 speech at the end of the novel, Satan Mekratrig explains that, compared to humans, demons are good, and that if perhaps God has withdrawn Himself, then Satan beyond all others was qualified to take His place and, if anything, would be a juster god. However, the defeat of Satan is complete. He cannot take up this throne and must hand the burning keys to man, as this is the most fell of all his fell damnations. He never wanted to be God at all, and so having won all, has he lost all."

Deadline
 is set several decades after the 
zombie apocalypse
, the Rising. Two man-made viruses (cures for cancer and the common cold) combined to form Kellis-Amberlee, a normally beneficial virus that, on the death of any host mammal over 40 pounds (18 kg) (and sometimes spontaneously, before that mammal's death), ""goes live"" or ""amplifies"", and turns them into a 
zombie
. Most humans reside in controlled zones, with rigorous blood testing and decontamination used to stop the live KA virus from spreading. 
Bloggers
, in this universe are respected, credentialed journalists  (generally divided up as the fact-based ""Newsies"", the 
Steve Irwin
-inspired ""Irwins"", and the entertaining ""Fictionals"") providing news and entertainment. A year after the events of 
Feed
, Shaun Mason is still coming to terms with having had to kill his infected sister, Georgia, and has stepped back from his role as an Irwin to head After the End Times, in an administrative role.

After returning to 
Oakland, California
, after a field excursion with Rebecca ""Becks"" Atherton (Shaun's replacement as the site's top Irwin), Alaric Kwong (a Newsie), and Dave Novakowski (another Irwin), Shaun receives a visit from Dr. Kelly Connolly, a 
Centers for Disease Control
 (CDC) researcher. Dr. Connolly had faked her death using a 
clone
 after her colleagues, researching the abnormally high death rate among people with ""reservoir conditions"" (in whom the active virus is present but confined to one part of the host's body, a condition Georgia had while alive), began dying at a suspiciously high rate: actions possibly linked to the conspiracy uncovered in the previous book. As they discuss this, a sizable zombie outbreak occurs; Dave overrides the lockdown so the others can escape but dies when the site is 
firebombed
.

The team flees to 
Weed, California
, where Magdalene ""Maggie"" Garcia, billionaire 
pharmaceutical company
 heiress and head Fictional at After the End Times, lives. They track down a non-CDC laboratory in 
Portland, Oregon
 and head there to learn more about Dr. Connolly's findings. A rogue researcher, Dr. Shannon Abbey, reveals that reservoir conditions are an 
immune response
 to the virus, and those with the conditions may fight off zombification. Shaun and Becks then head to Portland's CDC office, where they escape a zombie outbreak staged to kill them. The group next returns to Maggie's, and Shaun sends the collected data to Mahir Gowda (a British resident and the website's head Newsie), hoping he can find independent verification.

A fortnight later, Mahir arrives unannounced with news that all Kellis-Amberlee 
substrains
 were lab-engineered, and people with reservoir conditions are being killed off before each new substrain appears. Armed with this information, Shaun leads Dr. Connolly, Becks, and Mahir to the CDC office in 
Memphis, Tennessee
, to break in and confront Dr. Connolly's boss, Joseph Wynne. Dr. Wynne reveals he organised the Oakland outbreak to kill Dr. Connolly and the bloggers; he is part of a widespread conspiracy to keep people afraid and compliant while the zombie virus is stabilised. In the following struggle, Dr. Wynne is killed, and Dr. Connolly is infected with the live virus. She sacrifices herself to distract security while the others escape. The team heads back to California, driving through a 
hurricane
 and finding most of the country deserted.

On reaching Maggie's, Shaun and company learn that most of the country has been locked down following massive outbreaks along the 
Gulf Coast
: a Second Rising. Shaun figures out that the cause is not an 
airborne
 strain of live virus as most fear, but it is now being 
transmitted by mosquitoes
. He confirms this with Dr. Abbey and receives an offer to join her in 
Shady Cove, Oregon
. Shaun and Mahir organise the rest of the site's staff to propagate what they have learned, before those at Maggie's evacuate. Shortly before reaching Shady Cove, Shaun is attacked and bitten, and is quarantined in Dr. Abbey's lab. Despite several tests, he shows no sign of becoming a zombie. The novel's coda reveals that despite her apparent death, Georgia is somehow alive and well in an unknown CDC facility."

Giraut and Margaret, now married, are sent on a diplomatic mission to the politically turbulent planet Briand, a distant Outer Sphere colony cut off from the rest of humanity for centuries until instantaneous travel became possible with the springer. Not only is Briand a very hot, high gravity planet, but the oppressive environment is matched by the increasing hatred between the two proud local cultures which have been forced to live in close proximity as a result of a volcano disaster—the 
Tamil
 Mandalam culture of New 
Tanjavur
 (based on an interpretation of 
Sangam literature
) and the 
Maya
 culture that has been forced to live in the 
slum
 of Mayatown and the newly-grown city of Yaxkin
tulum
 after the destruction of their native Kintulum (based on an interpretation of 
pre-Columbian
 
Maya civilization
), have strained relations to the point that the Council of Humanity fears that full-scale war or 
ethnic cleansing
 may envelop Briand.  Giraut and Margaret are given orders by Shan, their Office of Special Projects supervisor, to find the real power brokers of each culture in order to defuse the headline-grabbing daily ethnic attacks and steer the planet clear of all-out war. They must do this under the nose of Ambassador Kiel, a high ranking ambassador from Earth on Briand, who believes strengthening elected government officials is the only way to address a crisis.

Giraut and Margaret arrive as their marriage is falling apart, but focus on their work and establish contact with key Tamil people. They are assigned a Tamil assistant, Kapilar, with whom they both spend a lot of time. They are at first unable speak directly to the reclusive Mayans, except for Tz'iquin, the Mayan contact in New Tanjavur. After a small mob attacks Paxa Prytanis, another secret agent sent by the Office of Special Projects, an invitation by the Maya comes unexpectedly. Giraut, Kapilar and Tz'iquin travel to Yaxkintulum in the latter's flying yacht, as the Mayans have officially refused to adopt the springer as well as other technological conveniences, and rely on simple subsistence farming in order to preserve their cultural heritage. Giraut meets Tz'iquin's grandfather, Pusiictsom, the most powerful and influential priest in Yaxkintulum, who, despite being in charge of the traditionally conservative Center Temple, is a reformer working on reconciliation with the Tamils behind the scenes. A plan is put into motion where Pusiictsom's nephew is raised to the position of prophet under the name ""Ix,"" with a plan to move to Yaxkintulum and start a cult movement of tolerance, modernization and truth about the founding of the two cultures. The plan calls for the new cult to be brutally oppressed by Mayan authorities, and Giraut, Kapilar, Ix and Tz'iquin stage an escape to New Tanjavur.

Through a series of public appearances, Ix begins to recruit Mayans and some Tamils to his cult. He starts dating Auvaiyar, a notable and famously attractive Tamil critic several years his junior who had previously been involved with Tz'quin, Kapilar and Kannan, a deeply bigoted Tamil critic and poet who heads the avant-garde movement and hopes to create a 
Fourth Sangam
. The rumor that Ix has an affair with a Tamil causes mass riots, which Ix unexpectedly ends by confessing in public, despite Pusiictsom's protests, that his prophecy began as a ploy by his family, the Peccaries. Tz'iquin breaks into tears during his uncle's speech, revealing to Giraut his jealousy at his uncle's upcoming marriage to his former girlfriend. Just prior to Ix's next speech, however, Auvaiyar is found dead, her heart and lungs missing. Ix reacts calmly to the discovery, and decides to show the corpse to the crowd during his speech. Giraut and Kannan bring her body to the central plaza, before the temple of 
Murukan
 where Ix was going to wed Auvaiyar. As the prophet speaks to the mixed Tamil/Mayan crowd, he uses his pain, her murder and his forgiveness to whoever did it as a starting point for reconciliation between the two cultures.

Tz'iquin comes forth, confesses Auvaiyar's murder (saying that he ate her heart, as 
Tohil
 is known to do), and shoots his uncle in the head with a 
maser
. Kannan goes on a murderous rampage against the Mayans as a full-scale race war erupts. Giraut and Kapilar run back to the Embassy, where the former is ordered to evacuate it immediately. Almost everyone in the embassy is evacuated through springers to Earth, but Ambassador Kiel is captured by Tamils, and Kapilar refuses to go, choosing instead to join the fighting to honor his 
Vellala
 heritage.

Giraut, Margaret and Shan watch the civil war unfold from a space station in the Inner Sphere. Mayan forces invade New Tanjavur through Pusiictsom's secret springer, an attack that the Peccaries had been planning for at least a year. Illegal anti-matter weapons are used by both sides, completely destroying both Yaxkintulum and New Tanjavur. The habitable areas of Briand are devastated, and with no springers left intact, the planet becomes isolated from the rest of humanity until a springer ship can arrive in several decades' time.

Giraut finds out from Margaret that she had been having an affair with Kapilar since the mission began, and was ordered to not break it off by his friend and boss Shan, who hoped he could acquire valuable intelligence through Kapilar. The failure of the Office of Special Projects on Briand forces the secretive agency into the limelight, and they brace for public scrutiny and oversight. Giraut opts to take his one-year-long leave on the Hedon culture of Söderblom to try to salvage his marriage and to get away from Shan, but after that one year, he wants back into the Office of Special Projects to continue the important mission of integrating humanity to provide a united front for possible alien contact.'"

Set in 17th-century France at the court of the Sun King, 
King Louis XIV
, the young, colony-raised, naïve Mademoiselle Marie-Josèphe de la Croix is the lady-in-waiting to King Louis XIV's niece. Her brother, Father Yves de la Croix (a natural philosopher and explorer), has recently returned from a mission commissioned by the king: to bring back the endangered sea monster whose flesh is rumoured to give the consumer immortality. Father Yves brings back two specimens: one, a dead male sea monster covered in sawdust and ice; the other, a live female sea monster placed in the 
Apollo fountain
 in the 
Palace of Versailles
.

Acting as her brother's assistant, sketching the dead sea monster's dissection, and caring for the live specimen, Marie-Josèphe soon realizes the creature is not a sea monster, but a sea woman. Thus, Marie-Josèphe tries to convince the others at court, including her brother, that the sea woman is intelligent and hopefully free her. Unfortunately, only Marie-Josèphe can understand the sea woman (now called Sherzad) and her musical way of talking. As a result, the court ignores her.

They bleed her for hysteria, the 
pope
 openly shows outrage over the impropriety of her composing a cantata, and several court men harass her on the King's hunt. At the same time, her slave Odelette (really called Haleed) struggles to gain her freedom. Only the stoic Count Lucien believes Marie-Josèphe about the sea woman, calmly taking the sea woman and Marie-Josèphe's scientific endeavors in stride. In order to save her own life, Sherzad, the sea monster, offers the king the location of a sunken treasure ship in return for her freedom. But despite the discovery of Spanish gold found from the wreck, the king intends to keep Sherzad and eat her, the lure of immortality being too strong.

Marie-Josèphe and Count Lucien (whom she has fallen in love with) plot secretly to release Sherzad, defying the pope, their king and her brother. Their attempt fails, but Yves (finally realizing Sherzad's sentience and its repercussions on his actions) aids them in finally releasing Sherzad. In the end, Marie-Josèphe and Count Lucien are exiled, but Sherzad, who had declared vengeance on all humanity, showers them with forgotten sunken treasures in gratitude."

Sailing to the Future

The story begins with Elric lost somewhere in the Young Kingdoms and near the sea. A mysterious ship appears and he is welcomed aboard by its captain and introduced to three other powerful warriors. The captain informs the adventurers that they are traveling across time and between realities. They have been found because they alone have the power to stop alien sorcerers from destroying their worlds. They come to understand that they (Elric, 
Erekosë
, 
Dorian Hawkmoon
, and 
Corum Jhaelen Irsei
) are 
Eternal Champions
 and are actually four different iterations of the same being. The Champions are instructed that they must slay the evil beings and destroy their building by fire. Upon finding the dwelling place of the creatures, they face many dangers within. The Champion finds a sentient pool in a well that seems to be trying to communicate to its partner. The four Champions assimilate into one eight-armed being, and destroy the creature in the pool,  only to discover that the 'building' they have invaded is the body of the other creature. They destroy it and go their separate ways, with the memory of what happened fading like a dream.



Sailing to the Present
[

Elric finds himself on another shore without the memory of his last adventure. He meets a sailor called Count Smiorgan Baldhead who accompanies Elric as they are followed by a mysterious, riderless horse. Elric and Smiorgan find that they are in another world, one inhabited by a Melnibonéan nobleman named Saxif D’an. Saxif recognizes Elric but does not honor his sovereignty in this realm. Saxif is the subject of an old Melnibonean tale. In the legend, Saxif loved a half-human woman but she loved another; Prince Carolak. In the legend, Saxif kills the woman rather than see her with another, only to learn with her dying breath that she still loved him. Saxif is now obsessed with a woman, Vassliss,  who resembles his dead love and Prince Carolak reveals himself on a horse and defeats Saxif.



Sailing to the Past
[

Elric and Smiorgan, after passing through the Crimson Gate, are saved from drowning by Duke Avan and his men. Duke Avan is travelling to find R’lin K’Ren A’a, the ancestral city of the Melnibonéans, where he seeks two rare gems purported to be the eyes of a large jade statue of Arioch. Elric and Smiorgan decide to join him on the voyage.

Using a map that Duke Avan has procured, the group crosses the boiling sea and finds the island marked on the map where R’lin K’Ren A’a is located. They enter the mouth of a river to head inland on the island. Along the river they are attacked by reptilian savages with human features and stork-like legs who hurl sharp crystalline disks from clubs. Losing the battle and with defeat imminent, Elric summons aid from King Nnuuurrrr’c’c of the Insects. Nnuuurrrr’c’c hears his summons and sends a swarm of giant dragonflies who annihilate the reptilian savages.

Elric, Smiorgan, Duke Avan, and the surviving crewman eventually find the island within the island where R’lin K’Ren A’a lies according to the map. They disembark from the ship into the jungle and eventually find the city. At the city they also find the great jade statue of Arioch, but the eyes are missing. The group is suddenly attacked by the reptilian savages again and Elric summons aid from Arioch who refuses to help.

The group flees into an intact building in the ruins to escape their attackers. In the building they find a message that appears to have been recently scribed. They emerge from the other side of the building into the central square of the city where they see two glass dome structures. Then they run into the nearest structure to again escape the pursuing savages where the group then becomes separated from each other.

Lost in the maze of the crystal structure, Elric and the others are saved by a naked man named J’osui C’reln Reyr who is revealed to be a 10,000-year-old man known from legend as the Creature Doomed to Live. J’osui hides them from the savage reptiles, whom he calls the Olab, and reveals that the crystal structure they were in is one of the eyes of the jade statue of Arioch. Elric learns from J’osui why he is cursed to live and why Elric’s ancestors were forced to leave R’lin K’Ren A’a for Melniboné. He also learns how he can end the curse by summoning Arioch to possess the jade statue and cause it to leave the city.

They return to the jade statue and Elric begins the ritual to summon Arioch. During the ritual, Stormbringer compels Elric to slay Duke Avan and a remaining crewman so that Arioch will heed the summons. Arioch comes, possesses the statue, and it leaves the city with its eyes intact. Stormbringer then leaps from Elric’s hand and slays J’osui C’reln Reyr. Elric and Smiorgan depart the city and find another ship laden with treasure that J’osui had informed them of, then sail away from the island.

The story begins on 14 May 2012 as Dr. Shadrach Mordecai, personal physician of the dictator Genghis II Mao IV, awakens. He checks the health of the dictator through a series of implants within his body that link to the general health of his client, allowing him to receive any information on the health of the dictator through codings of various twitches in his own body. Through a series of security checks, he enters into his office to prepare for a kidney transplant for his master.

As he passes Surveillance Vector One, the eye on the world which gives committee members the ability to view all events happening on Earth, he meets Mangu, the prince of the world and viceroy of the committee, a charming man who earns the admiration of all his subjects. Mangu is concerned about the surgery, but Shadrach Mordecai assures the prince that Genghis Mao has grown used to surgeries. Here, Shadrach also reveals to the reader that Mangu was chosen as the subject for Project Avatar, where Genghis Mao will continue to reign in the body of his own son. He also feels sorry for Mangu, since he was tricked by his father into believing that he would inherit the throne. Once in his office, he contacts Nicholas Warhaftig, surgeon of the dictator. Warhaftig orders Shadrach to bring Genghis Mao to the Surgery by 0900. Soon, Genghis Mao himself contacts Shadrach to ask how his health is that day. As Shadrach tells the dictator of his health state, he also informs the dictator of the incoming surgery and its timing. Genghis Mao requests for Shadrach to enter his room and prepare him for the surgery at 0900. We also learn from this conversation that the surgery would give the dictator the fourth liver he is having. Afterwards, Shadrach looks up the leaders of the projects Talos, Phoenix and Avatar, for it is his responsibility as personal physician to the Khan to keep checks on the progress of such projects. First, he contacts Katya Lindman of Project Talos. She reports to Shadrach their progress in coding Genghis Mao's eyelid mannerisms and as Shadrach asks her to continue working on coding his mental processes, she has an apprehensive look but agrees. Next, he contacts Irayne Sarafrazi of Project Phoenix. She talks of her problems with brain cell deterioration and becomes worried as Shadrach presses for her to make further progress in the subject. Lastly, he contacts Nikki Crowfoot of Project Avatar, who is also Shadrach's lover. After she recounts her progress, she arranges a meeting with Shadrach for 0230.

Shadrach reveals to the reader his belief that Project Avatar is far superior to the other two, since Project Talos could only create an automated Genghis Mao which could never live up to the ability of the original while Project Phoenix would constantly be confronted with the problem of brain cell regeneration. Afterwards, he leaves to take Genghis Mao to the Surgery. As Warhaftig and his team operate on the dictator, Shadrach, due to his implants, acts as a ""computer"" for the team, informing them of the health status of the dictator throughout the entire surgical process. During the operation, Shadrach also comments on the calmness and tranquility of the dictator and how he has grown accustomed to constant organ transplants. After the surgery, he prepares to leave with Crowfoot to Karakorum, the playground of the world's ruling class. As they enter Karakorum, Nikki Crowfoot muses about how Shadrach and Genghis Mao are like one entity and compares them to the sculptor and his sculpture, how the actions and health situation of Genghis Mao affect the actions of Shadrach. Nikki Crowfoot decides they ought to go to the transtemporallism tent, where supposedly religious rites are carried out using chemicals to transport a client into a dream-like state where he may witness famous scenes, usually related to Christianity. Shadrach is transported to the scene of the Cotopaxi eruption, where he helplessly watches the civilians die all around him. When he wakes up and leaves the tent, he sees many government members, who greet him. Among them is Roger Buckmaster, who claims that he has gained enlightenment from the transtemporallist experience.

Buckmaster first recounts his dream of the Last Supper and the subsequent betrayal at Gethsemane, and how it taught him to hate evil. Then, he begins insulting Shadrach and blaming him for keeping Genghis Mao alive. Both Shadrach and Buckmaster have a lengthy moral argument, but soon Nikki Crowfoot leaves the tent and they leave the area, with Buckmaster shouting curses to Shadrach. Shadrach and Nikki book a room and sleep together, after which they encounter Bela Horthy and Donna Lambile, two members of the government.

Mangu is giving a speech about the worldwide distribution of Rondevic's Antidote against organ rot, to which Bela Horthy yells curses that Genghis Mao constantly lies about healing the world from the organ rot disease, despite the desperate urgings of Lambile. The next day, Shadrach awakes feeling tremendous vigorous twitches from the implants and immediately rushes to meet the Khan. There, he sees many government members surrounding the dictator. He learns from Ionigylakis, the Vice President, that Mangu was assassinated. He soon realises that the twitches were due to the shock from Genghis Mao when he received the news. He also learns that Bela Horthy was the one who witnesses Mangu falling from his window before he informed the Khan. Genghis Mao gives Avogadro, the security chief, orders for subsequent arrests and sentences against suspected individuals in order to invoke fear into the population.

In Committee Vector One, Shadrach has a brief conversation with Avogadro, who states that no one, not even Bela Horthy, saw any assassins throw Mangu out of the window, thus many government members believe it was merely suicide, but Genghis Mao remains convinced that Mangu was killed. Shadrach then asks Bela Horthy about the exact recount he gave to Genghis Mao. At first, Horthy is apprehensive but soon replies that he merely stated that Mangu had died and nothing else. Shadrach also learns from Horthy that Buckmaster has become a prime suspect in the assassination case due to his words of folly at Karakorum the previous night. Shadrach asks Horthy about his own words at Karakorum, but Horthy insists that he was not at Karakorum at all. Meanwhile, the committee members are in chaos as General Gonchigdorge struggles anxiously to find possible suspects and Surveillance Vector One. As the general calls for Frank Ficifolia, Ficifolia reveals to Shadrach his opinion that the committee members have gone mad and that Mangu had probably committed suicide. Shadrach returns to his room, where he sees Nikki Crowfoot. He recounts to her the incidents that occurred and Crowfoot is immediately shocked since her project is affected by the death of the chosen subject. As she listens to the subsequent events, she comments that Bela Horthy probably intended for Genghis Mao to feel great shock due to his testimony and perish. Shadrach returns to his office where he receives a call from Katya Lindman, who requests that he review her progress on Project Talos. She shows the robot of Genghis Mao and all its actions and becomes angry when Shadrach does not seem impressed. As she continues to show Shadrach all her equipment, Shadrach begins to suspect that she has feelings for him.

Later on, he receives a call from Avogadro to participate in his interrogation of Buckmaster. During the interrogation, Buckmaster constantly defends himself, saying that he was drugged from the transtemporallism. Avogadro is shocked that Shadrach also attempts to defend Buckmaster, but more passively. However, in the end, Buckmaster is arrested on the basis of a faulty ""I'll destroy him"" while he was arguing with Shadrach at Karakorum. Shadrach then argues with Avogadro, saying that it was not justified to arrest a man he knew was innocent. However, Avogadro is apathetic to the plight of Buckmaster and even uses Shadrach's words at Karakorum against him that ""guilt is a luxury we cannot afford"". They both assume that Buckmaster is being sent to the Organ Farms, where his organs would be used to support the dictator.  The next day, Shadrach visits Genghis Mao, who speaks deliriously and even offers to make Shadrach pope in Rome. Shadrach infers that Genghis Mao has gone mad over the death of Mangu. That night, he goes to Karakorum with Katya Lindman, where they try dream-death, an experience where one is placed in a dream-like state and imagines death and the subsequent afterlife. Shadrach travels the afterlife realm with Katya in his dreams, and after enjoying themselves, to enters into a tranquil state before awaking. Katya reveals that she was having a different dream from him, one which was not as light-hearted as his. Then, they return home to rest, where Katya randomly and suddenly warns Shadrach to be careful. Nikki Crowfoot grows increasingly distant from him, and Shadrach is unable to discover why. He visits Genghis Mao and informs the dictator of an aneurysm he detected in the dictator's abdominal aorta. The news annoys Genghis Mao, since he is preparing a colossal funeral for Mangu which he refuses to delay. Shadrach has lunch with Katya, who reveals to him that, on the night before his death, she informed Mangu that he was chosen as the Avatar subject. Katya tells Shadrach that she did so only out of sympathy for Mangu, but Shadrach suspects that she wanted to kill the Avatar subject so that her project could supersede Nikki's and hopefully destroy her relationship with Shadrach so she could have him too. However, he soon realises that his suspicions contradict Katya's decision to reveal this information to him. Shadrach hopes to visit Nikki and after learning that she had fallen ill, makes the decision to visit her in her room. There, he pretends to examine her but subsequently asks about her project, to which she responds angrily, ranting about the setbacks in her work. As Shadrach leaves, he also reveals to Nikki that a member of Project Talos informed Mangu that he had been chosen as the Avatar subject, but he disguises it as a rumour. However, Nikki believes it and instantly suspects Katya Lindman to be the culprit. Later, Shadrach confesses to Katya what he had revealed to Nikki. Katya is disturbed at first, but soon informs Shadrach that he had been chosen as the next Avatar subject. Shadrach soon realises that that had to be the reason Nikki had chosen to distance herself from him. Katya advises Shadrach to make a plan of escape and also tells him not to trust Nikki anymore, since she must have agreed to continue her work despite the fact that he was chosen. The day of the aorta transplant arrives. During the surgeries, Shadrach thinks to himself that if he killed Genghis Mao on the operating table, Project Avatar would be finished. He muses about plans such as jostling Warhaftig's elbow or feeding them misleading information, but resolves not to.

In his office, Shadrach begins thinking about Genghis Mao's possible origins and begins crafting fake diary entries from the perspective of Genghis Mao in his mind. Soon, he decides to confront Nikki Crowfoot about him being the Avatar subject. Nikki is shocked and somewhat remorseful, but she defends herself, saying there was nothing she could do. Shadrach is distraught, but lets the matter rest. He resorts to carpentry to cope with the stress. On one of his adventures to the carpentry chapel, he meets Frank Ficifolia, who offers Shadrach the chance to escape from Ulan Bator and remain hidden. Ficifolia also reveals that members of the government helped to conceal Buckmaster, who is still alive, and offers to do the same for Shadrach. However, Shadrach is unsure and asks for time to think. Then, he is approached by Bela Horthy, who advises Shadrach to take the offer and flee from Ulan Bator, but Shadrach continues to refuse. He makes a visit to the Project Avatar laboratory to meet Nikki Crowfoot. After a tour of the laboratory, Nikki takes him to her office. She advises Shadrach to flee from Ulan Bator, even at the expense of her work. However, Shadrach still wants more time to think, to which Nikki responds that she loves him still. Soon, Shadrach decides to go on a vacation so that he would think better overseas. He informs Genghis Mao about his decision, who is slightly disappointed but agrees. Shadrach first goes to Nairobi, where he meets Bhishma Das, a merchant. Bhishma Das constantly asks him questions about the organ rot disease and the Roncevic's Antidote. As they continue their conversation, Shadrach begins speaking of utopian ideals that, after many years, the world will rebuild itself. Although he is unsure of this prophecy, under the encouragement of Bhishma Das, he becomes convinced that that will eventually happen. This gives him encouragement to deal with the problem of Project Avatar. He then leaves for Jerusalem, where he meets Meshach Yakov at the Wailing Wall. Shadrach is distressed about the widespread organ rot and poverty amongst the people, including children, and he prays. Meshach takes Shadrach to his house, where he and his family chat with Shadrach about politics. He then goes to Istanbul, Rome and San Francisco. In each place, he is constantly distressed by the suffering of the people but also begins to suspect that the Citpols, policemen of the Genghis Mao regime, are spying on him.

At San Francisco, he meets an old friend, Jim Ehrenreich, who is struck with organ rot and requests that Shadrach steal some of Rondevic's Antidote for him. However, Shadrach refuses, saying that the antidote only immunises and cannot cure. At first, Ehrenreich is angry but after a while, he accepts his fate. At Peking, Shadrach begins to feel strange twitches in his implants and after a series of checks begins to suspect clogging of cerebrospinal fluid. He rushes to the airport, hoping to get a quick flight back to Ulan Bator. At the airport, he meets Avogadro, who informs Shadrach of the multiple headaches suffered by Genghis Mao and that he requested for Shadrach's return to the capital. Shadrach returns to the capital and visits Genghis Mao, informing his master of the problem and suggests that it be cured by brain surgery: more specifically, to implant valved tubes to his skull to drain the excess fluid. Afterwards, Shadrach arranges a meeting with Frank Ficifolia, requesting to meet Buckmaster. Although Ficifolia is annoyed that Shadrach chose to return when he could have escaped the capital, Shadrach reassures him that he has a plan. Ficifolia agrees to arrange the meeting. Shadrach is taken to the transtemporallists in Karakorum, where Buckmaster has hidden himself as an ascetic, entering multiple dreams to witness the life of Jesus. Shadrach requests for Buckmaster to create a device that will allow him to control the valve that will be implanted into Genghis Mao, and after much persuasion, Buckmaster agrees.

In Ulan Bator, he arranges a meeting with Katya Lindman. Both of them talk about the funeral of Mangu, which he missed while he was on holiday. He also informs her about his cure for the headaches of Genghis Mao, and despite the warnings of Katya, Shadrach states that he has a plan to save himself. Soon, Genghis Mao is operated on and the valved tubes transplanted. He then meets Nikki Crowfoot, who informs him of her progress in Project Avatar. She adds that she hopes her project will not be chosen, but Shadrach tells her not to worry about him but to focus on her work instead. To rest, he leaves again for Karakorum unaccompanied and visits the dream-death tent, where he enters the afterlife and heals numerous people in the dream. He is hailed as their Saviour but is soon interrupted by the scene of Katya informing him that he was chosen as the Avatar subject. Shocked, he awakens and returns to Ulaanbaatar. Already implanted with the device to control the valved tubes, Shadrach visits Genghis Mao and informs him of how he is able to control the tubes using the device implanted in his hand and whenever he clenches his fist, the tubes will reverse, quickly killing the dictator. Instead of begging or becoming angry, Genghis Mao is pleased and informs Shadrach that he was never going to become the Avatar subject in the first place. He also admires Shadrach's shrewdness in dealing with the situation. Shadrach demands to become a committee member in charge of public health to oversee the production and worldwide distribution of Roncevic's Antidote. Genghis Mao agrees and, confused about the dictator's reactions, Shadrach leaves the room to admire the outside world."

Prior to the beginning of the story, humanity has been expelled from Earth by powerful aliens known as ""the Invaders"", and scattered across eight planets and satellites of the 
Solar System
, the so-called 
Eight Worlds
. The Invaders originate from a 
gas giant
 planet, and have occupied 
Jupiter
, forbidding human access to it. Human expansion to the Eight Worlds has been aided by a broadcast of information from outside the Solar System, named ""The Ophiuchi hotline"" after the constellation 
Ophiuchus
 from which it appears to originate. The information received from this includes extensive material on biological modification, and while sex changes and other modifications have become routine surgeries, experimentation with human DNA remains taboo and forbidden on penalty of death. Related to this, while technology has been developed to allow people to back-up their memories, this is only permitted for implantation within a cloned body in case of death. Due to resource scarcity, only one clone of a person is allowed to exist at any one time, and, similarly, reproduction is restricted to one child per person. An exception exists for those people who join the artificially-created symbionts that can live openly in the vacuum of space.

The protagonist, Lilo, has experimented with human DNA and, when discovered, is sentenced to death. However, the night before her execution, a powerful lunar politician named Tweed offers her the chance to escape her sentence by replacing her with a clone killed in her place. Lilo accepts and Tweed takes her into hiding.

Tweed is the leader of a movement that intends to expel the Invaders and recover Earth, and makes Lilo join this movement under the watch of Vaffa, a guard who has multiple illegal clones, both male and female. Lilo attempts to escape twice, but each time she is killed by Vaffa, and a clone is revived with her original memories. 

The third clone of Lilo is sent to an outlying moon of Jupiter, 
Poseidon
, within which Tweed pursues clandestine research performed by illegal clones. Lilo bonds with Cathay, the teacher of the colony's children, and they become lovers. She is given a null-field suit — a conforming forcefield with an air generator that protects her from the vacuum — and is tasked with researching how to kill creatures that live in Jupiter's atmosphere. She reveals to Cathay that, when she began her original experiments, she put a clone of herself and a backup of her memories in a secret base in Saturn's rings, to ensure her survival in the event that she was executed.

Tweed then acquires a 
micro black hole
 with the intention of passing it through Jupiter in an attack on the Invaders. Lilo and Cathay board the ship transporting the black hole and seize it. After a struggle, Lilo and a Vaffa clone fall towards Jupiter. Vaffa dies, but Lilo encounters an Invader and is taken to a future version of Earth almost devoid of humanity.

Tweed then awakens another version of Lilo and sends her with a clone of Vaffa to Pluto to research a new message coming from the Ophiuchi Hotline. This one has been translated as a payment demand for the information that humanity has received, but does not specify what form the payment is to take. Lilo and Vaffa find a second clone of Cathay, and the three of them are tasked to lease a ship from navigators dedicated to hunt for black holes, and go beyond the orbit of Pluto to analyze the message. They eventually hire Javelin, one of the most successful black hole hunters.  

Once in space, Javelin reveals that the black hole hunters have discovered that the beam of the Hotline originates from a point only half a light-year away from the solar system, scrambled to seem to come from much farther, and she will take them to the source of the beam. However, since the trip will take 20 years Lilo, Vaffa and Cathay go in hibernation.

In the meantime, the first clone of Cathay uses the stolen ship to reach Lilo's base. There he meets Parameter/Solstice, a human-symbiont pair who also know the location of the base. They revive the clone and use the ship to attack Poseidon, taking it out of orbit and destroying its security systems. To do this they crash Lilo's base into a black hole held in a force field on the moon's surface.  They carry out a plan to transform the asteroid into a ship to travel to 
Alpha Centauri
, but reveal Tweed's dangerous activities to the Eight Worlds, forcing Tweed to go into hiding. 

When Javelin's ship and its passengers reaches the source of the Hotline, they are greeted by seemingly-human extraterrestrials who have been expecting them. They explain that most races in the universe have experienced a similar history with the Invaders: they are expelled from their home planets by the Invaders; they attempt to recover their planets by force, much as Tweed has been doing; and in the ensuing conflict they are driven out of their solar systems entirely. The extraterrestrials have been broadcasting information via the Ophiuchi Hotline to give humanity the tools they need for survival, and the price they ask in exchange is to be allowed to live alongside and within the minds of humans, so that they can add humanity's experience and thoughts to their own pool of knowledge. They suggest that, if humanity does not comply, they will turn the symbionts into an army that will attack humanity on the Eight Worlds. 

The clone of Lilo previously transported to Earth spends 25 years there. Because of her null-field suit which she can turn on at will, she is worshipped as a god by the surviving humans scratching out a living at a pre-industrial technological level. During a dive to hunt a whale, she encounters an Invader, somehow steals a silver cube from it and is instantaneously transported to the source of the Hotline. There she meets her clone, and they find that the memories and knowledge of all of their clones, including those killed by Tweed, are somehow mixed and shared between them.

Somewhat surprised by this turn of events, the extraterrestrials explain that the silver cube is a 
singularity
 that can be used for space propulsion by canceling inertia. They add that the Invaders only give such a ""gift"" to races when they're preparing to expel them entirely from their home planetary system. Confronted with this news, Javelin, Cathay, Vaffa and both clones of Lilo return to the solar systems to alert humanity.

As the novel concludes, the clone of Lilo traveling in the asteroid towards Alpha Centauri meditates on her shared memories, and realizes that when she arrives there her fellow clones, and most of humanity, will be already be there waiting for her, having used the singularity for faster travel."

On the road to Armida, Damon Ridenow encounters Leonie Hastur, Keeper of Arilinn. Leonie tells him that she wishes to persuade Callista Lanart to return to Arilinn Tower and replace her as Keeper. She is aware that Callista wishes to marry the Terran, Andrew Carr, who rescued her from the Caves of Corresanti (as seen in 
The Spell Sword
). After they arrive, Leonie meets with Callista and unable to persuade her to return, releases her from her Keeper's vow. Dom Esteban, Callista's father, consents to her marriage. The next day, a joint wedding is held – Ellemir is joined to Damon and Callista to Andrew in freemate marriage.

Andrew recalls that Leonie has warned him that Callista was trained in the old ways of Keepers, and may not be able to consummate their relationship for a long time. Ellemir has a premonition of her father's death. Desiderio Leynier, a nedestro relation (Dom Alton's illegitimate son), creates trouble at the wedding feast.

Guardsmen who have been caught in a blizzard are brought to Armida. When it becomes clear that some of the men will lose their feet to frostbite, Damon, working with Andrew and Dezi, uses his laran powers to restore their circulation. The experience causes Damon to feel that laran-based healing should be available to all Darkovans, not restricted to the cloistered residents of the Towers. He reflects that it is  commonly believed that this would bring back the 
Ages of Chaos
.

Callista agrees to share Andrew's bed. They become telepathically aware of the lovemaking of Damon and Ellemir. When Andrew accidentally breaks the link, Callista's Keeper training cuts in and Andrew takes the full blast of her laran. Damon comes to realize that Leonie has tampered with Callista's channels before she reached puberty – the ""old ways"" that Leonie had warned him about.

Andrew is overwhelmed the experiences of the past day and walks out into the courtyard to think. He is overcome by a compulsion to leave Armida, and wanders out into the snow. Damon realizes that Dezi has overpowered Andrew telepathically and driven him away. After Andrew is rescued, Dom Esteban tells Damon that ""there is bad blood"" in Dezi. Damon strips Dezi of his matrix.

Damon decides to attempt timesearch: to contact Keepers in other times via the Overworld. He meets the legendary Varzil the Good of Neskaya. Varzil recommends the sacrament of Year's End as a way of freeing Callista from her Keeper's restrictions, but the meaning of the ritual has been lost.

Dom Esteban has premonitions of evil menacing his son, Domenic. That night, Callista wakes from a dream in which Domenic has come to harm. A guardsman arrives at Armina to inform Dom Esteban that Domenic has died during sword practice. Callista believes that he has been murdered.

Dom Esteban designates his youngest son, Valdir-Lewis Lanart-Alton to be his heir. He designates Damon Ridenow as Regent of Alton. Damon discovers that Dezi has taken Domenic's matrix while he lay injured, thus killing Domenic, and rekeyed it to himself. Callista uses her ability to take Domenic's matrix away from Dezi. He dies as a result.

Damon realizes that their actions constitute an unofficial matrix circle – a forbidden tower. Leonie Hastur informs him that she will bring charges in council regarding his illegal matrix work. The two couples confront the council. Leonie challenges Damon to a duel between Arilinn Tower and the Forbidden Tower.

Damon breaks down the remaining emotional walls separating the two couples, realizing that essence of the sacrament of Year's End is a shared sexual experience under the influence of kireseth flowers. Callista and Andrew finally consummate their marriage.

At dawn, they enter into the Overworld and build their tower. After a prolonged battle with Arilinn, Damon asks for a truce. He tells Leonie that they have rediscovered the old way of working, where a Keeper need not be a cloistered virgin. He realizes that Leonie herself was trained in the old ways (the illegal neutering of a Comyn woman), and mourns for her loss. Leonie acknowledges Damon's right to keep his tower.

The two couples return to Armida.

The novel's plot concerns Lord Montfallcon and his contest for courtly influence against Captain Quire. Each man exploits Albion's shadowy network of espionage and deceit for his own ends, with Gloriana caught in the middle.

Montfallcon has maintained peace throughout Gloriana's 13-year reign using terror, oppression, and a network of 
informants
. He is the power behind Gloriana's throne, one of the few survivors of King Hern's court, where he saw most of his family killed to entertain that tyrant king. Montfallcon's sole purpose in life is to keep Gloriana's Albion free of tyranny and corruption but, in so doing, he repeats the worst practices of Hern's henchmen. His own best henchman is Quire.

But when Quire feels Montfallcon has insulted him, he seeks revenge through seducing the frustrated Gloriana. He goes into the walls to spy on the court, to muster the rabble there into his personal army, and to make sorties into the court to commit murders and leave evidence that points to other courtiers. Finally Quire exits the walls and claims the role of Gloriana's court champion, later her lord chancellor, and ultimately her lover—threatening her place as sovereign and symbol of Albion. Ultimately, Una and Gloriana discover Flaya, Gloriana's long-lost mother, thought to have been murdered by Hern VI during one of his episodes of insanity, but still alive in an unexplored dungeon adjunct to the castle. After killing his insane daughter, Montfallcon battles Quire in a duel, leading to Montfallcon's death. Able to provide the queen with an orgasm, Quire ultimately weds her, serving as her new consort, Prince Arthur."

Setting
[
edit
]


The novel takes place in a distant future in which diverse human societies have developed on some 6,000 planets. Many of these worlds are shared with intelligent nonhumans, although only one alien species (the mysterious Xlv) also possesses 
faster-than-light
 travel. In an attempt to find a stable defense against the phenomenon known as Cultural Fugue (a process where ""socioeconomic pressures [reach] a point of technological recomplication and perturbation where the population completely destroys all life across the planetary surface""), many human worlds have aligned themselves with one of two broad factions: the Sygn, which promotes and celebrates social diversity, and the Family, which promotes adherence to an idealized norm of human relations modeled on the nuclear family.



Prologue: A World Apart
[
edit
]


The novel opens with a prologue set on the planet Rhyonon. Korga, a tall, ""ugly"", misfit youth, undergoes the Radical Anxiety Termination, or RAT, procedure, a form of 
psychosurgery
, after which he ""will be a slave"" ""but [he] will be happy"".
[

]
 From then on he will be known as Rat Korga. After he has lived under a number of masters, all life on the surface of Rat Korga's world is destroyed by a conflagration.



Monologues: Visible and Invisible Persons Distributed in Space
[
edit
]


It is left up to debate whether Rat's world was destroyed by ""Cultural Fugue"" or by the mysterious Xlv spacecraft who were present in the Rhyonon system when the disaster occurred.  At the time of the disaster, Rat Korga was deep underground inside a refrigerated room, allowing him to survive (though badly injured) and making him the only known being to survive his world's destruction and possible Cultural Fugue. According to Reid-Pharr, Rat Korga represents the remnants of disaster.
[

]
 Thus, he serves as a reminder of the possibility of Cultural Fugue and the destruction of a planet, which is part of what makes him so appealing to the inhabitants of Velm.

The action then moves to Velm, a Sygn-aligned world that humanity shares with its native three-sexed intelligent species, the evelm, and where sexual relationships take many forms — monogamous, promiscuous, anonymous, and interspecies. Resident Marq Dyeth, an ""industrial diplomat"" who helps manage the transfer of technology between different societies, is informed that Rat Korga is her perfect sexual match by an associate in the powerful and mysterious Web, an organization that manages information flows between worlds. Equipping him with a prosthesis (the rings of Vondramach Okk, a tyrant who once ruled ten planets and employed of one of Marq's ancestors) that restores the initiative he lost due to the RAT procedure, the Web sends Rat Korga to Velm under the pretext that he is a student, and he and Marq begin a romantic and sexual affair.

During their time together, Korga and Marq go dragon hunting, a process which initially Korga mistakes to involve catching and killing dragons. However, when he hits a dragon with his bow, Korga can see through the dragon's eyes and experience what the dragon is experiencing, prompting Rat to announce ""I was a dragon!"",
[

]
 and the realisation that no dragons are going to be killed. As they return to the city of Morgre, in which Dyethsome, Marq's ancestral home presides, they notice a large gathering of people. They seek shelter from the crowd, who appear to be gathering to see Rat Korga, with acquaintances of Marq's friend Santine. One of the people they are with called JoBonnot informs them that Marq's sister Black Lars' planned ""informal supper""
[
1
]
 has been cancelled. However, later Marq discovers that the gathering was not cancelled but changed to a ""formal supper"".
[
1
]


They return to Dyethshome where they attend the dinner party which involves everyone participating in hand-feeding one another. The dinner is held in the honour of the Thants, a family from the ice planet Zetzor. The Thants are considering moving to Nepiy in order to become a ""Focus Unit"", through which they will act as representatives of the values held by The Family.  The dinner soon becomes chaotic due to the disruptive presence of the Thants and the ever-growing group gathering outside to show their interest in Rat Korga. Marq overhears the Thants making derogatory comments toward the evelmi, and calling the people of the South of Velm ""lizard-loving perverts"".
[
1
]
 Soon after, Rat Korga is forced to leave Velm and be permanently separated from Marq. According to Avilez, Rat represents the hidden secret of what happened to Rhyanon, a fact which has caused an upheaval of society and poses a threat to the Web.

Epilogue: Morning
[
edit
]


Marq contemplates her loss of Rat Korga. She learns from Japril, a friend of hers in the Web who  set up her initial meeting with Korga, that their ""experiment didn't work"" and that it was ""too dangerous"" to leave Korga on Velm, due to the threat of Cultural Fugue. The reader learns more about the nuances of Marq's sexual attraction and her desire for Korga. According to Avilez, Marq's desire for Korga disrupts the power held by the Web.

Joe Cube is a high tech executive waiting for his company's 
IPO
. On the New Year's Eve before the new millennium, trying to impress his wife Jena, he brings home a prototype of his company's new product (a TV screen that turns standard television broadcasting into a 3D image). It brings no warmth to their cooling marriage, but it does attract the attention of somebody else. Joe is suddenly contacted by a Momo, a woman from the 
fourth dimension
 she calls the All, of which our entire world (which she calls Spaceland) is like nothing but the thin surface of a rug.

Momo has a business proposition for Joe that she will not let him refuse. She is bent on making him start a company that will create a specific product that she will supply. The upside potential becomes much clearer for Joe once Momo ""augments"" him, by helping him grow a new eye on a 4D stalk, giving him the power to see in four-dimensional directions, as well as the ability to see into our dimension using a four-dimension perspective."

[
edit
]


The novel proposes invasions from alternate Earths in alternate universes.  None of these universes are quite like our universe; however, they all have some element or other in common, many of which Pohl develops to satiric effect.



In one universe, 
Nancy Reagan
 is the 
President of the United States
 and her mostly disregarded husband 
Ronald
 is known as ""The First Gentleman"". 
John F. Kennedy
 is a Senator from 
Massachusetts
 who is married to a woman called 
Marilyn
.


In another universe, 
America
's political spectrum has shifted far to the right; Ronald Reagan remained true to his early left-wing politics and is still married to his first wife 
Jane Wyman
.


In the past of some of the worlds, the young revolutionary Joseph Dzhugashvili (not known in these worlds as 
Joseph Stalin
) had escaped from 
Russia
 to America in the 1900s, taking with him the proceeds of a robbery (the 
1907 Tiflis bank robbery
) conducted on behalf of the 
Bolsheviks
 and using the money to set himself up as a big American 
capitalist
.


The book presents multiple versions of three characters—Dominic DeSota, Nyla Christophe, and Larry Douglas—and their interactions as different versions of the characters travel from one Earth to another. Dominic DeSota is the main character, with most of the book told from the divergent viewpoints of three of his avatars (see following), with brief glimpses of numerous additional Dominic DeSotas scattered throughout the novel as varying between a nuclear scientist and a hunter scrabbling for bare existence in the ruins left after a 
nuclear holocaust
.

The book seems to argue in favor of the idea that social conditions rather than heredity shape a person's character and behavior (the 
nature versus nurture
 debate). As depicted again and again in the course of the book, people born with precisely the same genetic heritage can - given different social conditions - develop completely different character traits (timid or assertive, benevolent or predatory, etc.)



Origin of the title
[
edit
]


The title refers to the famous 
thought-experiment
 known as ""
Schrödinger's Cat
"", where the outcome of a real-world event depends on a quantum event. By some interpretations, the real-world object, in this case a cat, must be in two states simultaneously until it is observed. However, the story is more closely related to the 
many-worlds interpretation
 of 
quantum mechanics
 where all possible outcomes of an event occur, each in its own parallel universe. The same concept was treated, somewhat more pessimistically, in 
Larry Niven
's short story ""
All the Myriad Ways
""."

Early in the 
American Civil War
, rumors of gold in the 
Klondike
 have brought would-be 
prospectors
 to 
North America
's 
Pacific Northwest
. Anxious 
Russian
 investors commission 
American
 inventor Leviticus Blue to create a machine which can mine through the ice of 
Russian-owned Alaska
. Blue's ""Incredible Bone-Shaking Drill Engine"" (or ""Boneshaker"" for short, named after 
boneshaker
 bicycles of the era), instead destroys several blocks of downtown Seattle and releases a subterranean vein of ""blight gas"" that kills anyone who breathes it and turns some of the corpses into rotters (non-supernatural zombies). A wall is erected to contain the gas within the affected part of the city. Leviticus Blue is nowhere to be found.

Sixteen years later, Leviticus's wife and son, Briar and Zeke (Ezekiel) Wilkes, live in the impoverished outskirts of the former metropolis. Life is difficult, but Briar manages to support herself and Zeke by working a physically demanding 
blue collar
 job cleaning water. One day, Zeke enters the toxic city in search of evidence proving his father is innocent of the intentional destruction.  Briar intends on following, but the drainage hole collapses in an 
earthquake
. She then hitches a ride over the wall by a captain of an airship, the unnaturally tall Captain Cly. Meanwhile, Zeke meets Rudy, a man who claims to be a highly decorated lieutenant. Rudy tells Zeke that he can lead him to his parents' former house. The pair of them encounter a 
Native American
 woman named 
Princess Angeline
 who lightly wounds Rudy, but they manage to elude her.

Briar is attacked by rotters, which causes her to flee to the roof of a building, where she is rescued by Jeremiah Swakhammer and his Doozy Dazer. He takes her to a bar named in honor of her deceased father to meet people including the barkeeper, Lucy O'Gunning. Rotters attack the bar, forcing the occupants to retreat. It is later revealed that a man named Minnericht caused the rotter attack. Lucy takes Briar to see Minnericht, believed by some to be Leviticus Blue. Briar, however, doubts this. Unbeknownst to her, Minnericht has taken Zeke hostage. A battle breaks out between Minnericht's men and Swakhammer, Lucy, and the Indian princess. This battle attracts the rotters, complicating Briar's efforts to reunite with her son and exit the dangerous area of Seattle.

Swakhammer is found unconscious and in critical condition by Briar. She tries to make Minnericht help him, leading to a heated argument in which Briar renounces that he is Leviticus, and mocks him. Unbeknownst to Minnericht, the Indian Princess is behind him, and while Briar distracts him she comes, slits his throat, and kills him in revenge for her daughter Sarah's suicide, which he drove her to (Minnericht was Sarah's husband, making him Angeline's son-in-law).

Everyone reunites and escapes to the surface. Eventually Briar leads Zeke to her and Leviticus' old home and tells Zeke that she killed Leviticus Blue years ago, as he tried to escape Seattle with his Boneshaker. Briar shows her son Blue's mummified body, still inside Boneshaker. Zeke claims he doesn't hold any grudge against his mother for killing her husband, and they embrace, before leaving to loot what is left of the former Blue residence."

The events of 
Mythago Wood
 occur between 1946 and 1948. Stephen Huxley returns from service (after recuperating from his war wounds) to see his elder brother Christian, who now lives alone in their childhood home, Oak Lodge, just on the edge of Ryhope Wood. Their father, George, has died recently (their mother, Jennifer, died some years earlier). Christian is disturbed but intrigued by his encounters with one of the mythagos, while Stephen is confused and disbelieving when Christian explains the enigma of the wood. Both had seen mythagos as children, but their father explained them away as travelling 
Gypsies
. Christian returns to the wood for longer and longer periods, eventually assuming a mythical role himself. In the meantime Stephen reads about his father's and Edward Wynne-Jones's studies of the wood. Part of his research on the wood causes him to contact Wynne-Jones's daughter, Anne Hayden. Stephen also meets a local man named Harry Keeton, a burn-scarred ex-
RAF
 pilot, who encountered a similar wood when he was shot down over France and has since been trying to find a city that he saw there. Stephen and Harry try to survey and photograph Ryhope Wood from the air, but their small plane is buffeted back by inexplicable winds each time they try to fly over the trees. Stephen soon has his own encounters with the woodland mythagos (and an older Christian) and eventually, to save both his brother and a mythago girl named Guiwenneth (also referred to as Gwyneth or Gwyn), he ventures deep into the wood, accompanied by Harry.

The plot, set 30 years after humanity's resurrection, consists of three distinct plot lines, which come together towards the conclusion.

In the first plot line, Richard Burton and his friends continue their journey up river.  On their journey they encounter a group of ancient Egyptians who tell them of a mission which their Pharaoh had undertaken to reach the source of the River.  Accompanied by the Titanthrop Joe Miller, who they believed to be an avatar of Thoth, they scaled the mountains at the River's headwaters and descended into a polar sea, with a large black tower in the center.  On the shores they found a cave with supplies and boat.  One of their number died there, bringing the story back to the Valley.  Burton also discovers that his group has been infiltrated by traitors.  Through hypnosis, the Neanderthal Kaz identifies Monat and Pete Frigate as agents of the alien creators of the Riverworld.  When Burton goes to confront them he discovers that they have disappeared.

The second plot line deals with the real Peter Jairus Frigate, who is unaware that someone has been impersonating him (actually his deceased brother who died in infancy).  One day, a ship docks near his home and Frigate recognizes its captains as two of his childhood heroes, 
Tom Mix
 and 
Jack London
.  He signs on to the crew, joining the Sufi mystic Nur-ed-Din and the African warrior Umslopogas.  For years he travels with them without revealing that he knows Mix and London's identities.  When he finally confronts the men, they reveal that they had been recruited by the Mysterious Stranger to find the source of the River.  Eventually they come upon the metal rich nation of New Bohemia and Frigate suggests they build a balloon to reach the pole faster.  However, soon after launch their balloon is destroyed after an encounter with another airship.

In the third plot line, the nation of Parolando, now under the rule of President Milton Firebrass, is building an airship, which will allow them to reach the pole faster than Clemens' steamboat.  Cyrano de Bergerac has opted to stay behind to help with the project and proves to be a competent pilot.  Training is overseen by new arrival Jill Gulbirra, an Australian dirigible pilot and strident feminist.  The airship launches and rapidly makes the journey to the pole, where they discover the sea and the dark tower described by the Egyptians.  Firebrass and several others abruptly board a helicopter to fly down to the tower, but it explodes, killing them.  Engineer Barry Thorn is jailed after it is discovered that he planted a bomb on the helicopter.  The crew discover a doorway on the roof of the tower, but all attempts to enter it are stymied by an invisible force field.  Japanese Sufi Piscator is able to make it farther than anyone and disappears into the tower.  After he does not return, Jill Gulbirra decides to cut their losses and return home.  On the way back, they are persuaded by Clemens to mount an attack on King John's steamship.  Cyrano leads the attack, which nearly succeeds in kidnapping John, but the king escapes.  In the confusion, Barry Thorn escapes and parachutes from the airship, which explodes behind him.



During the third plot line, it is revealed that Firebrass knew the alien from Arcturus and the death of most of humanity in the year 2003 AD."

F'nor

F'nor

Brekke
 and discovers the wicked deeds of Weyrwoman Kylara. He also rediscovers the legendary 
fire-lizards
 from which dragons had been bred thousands of turns previously. 

F'lar
, F'nor's half-brother, is eventually forced into a duel with 
T'ron
, the leader of the Oldtimers, which ends in banishment for the Oldtimers who will not accept F'lar's leadership and in a grave injury for F'lar. Brekke's queen dragon (Wirenth) rises in mating flight but is attacked by Kylara's queen dragon (Prideth), and both dragons die, leaving their riders in near-catatonic states. Only Brekke recovers, mostly because she can hear other dragons (besides her own queen, Wirenth).

With the Lords Holder adamant that the dragonriders attempt to eliminate Thread at its source, F'nor attempts to direct himself and his dragon, Canth, to the Red Star, but they find the atmosphere inhospitable, and they fall back to Pern, badly injured.  Brekke's cry for F'nor not to leave her was also the inspiration for a song by

Riemann surface of the logarithm


Del lives in a world, in which a loop around its center with crossing a hoop at its edge doesn't lead back to the original point, but instead a new segment with a new sky. (On the cover, this is illustrated with a spiral, which in mathematics does indeed arise from the 
Riemann surface
 of the 
logarithm
.) All skies have been mapped by the ancient civilization of the Tolleans in the titular 
Book of All Skies
, a copy of which Del and other archeologists bring into a museum in their home city Apasa. At night, Orsino steals the book, after which Del chases after him across multiple hoops. Orsino reveals to have been paid more by someone else and can get rid of Del by injuring her knee with a thrown stone. In Apasa, no money is promised for an arrest, to not give Orsino and those who hired him any satisfsction, but it is instead used for an own cartography of the skies. Del joins an expedition to the last hoop, after which there is only void. Measurements of 
gravity
 have unveiled that there must be land across the void. A bridge build across the void collapses, leaving Del and Imogen cut off from their group on the other side. Both encounter the indigenous people of the other side and learn their language as well as about the new world called Jierra, which turns out to be a planet orbiting around a star. Del and Imogen are unfamiliar with many concepts, like a day or a year, since the Hoops are in total darkness with their people having evolved to have 
infrared
 vision. They learn from the indigenous people that the Hoops were artificially created on Old Jierra as an alternative to 
interstellar travel
 to create more living space. A fatal accident that also destroyed Old Jierra flooded them with 
lava
, cutting off the inhabitants within from the outside world. Any survivors who had already colonized other worlds in their system like Marrikh only returned to Jierra later. Subtle hints like the red color of Marrikh and a gas giant with 
four large moons
 in the system reveal that the story is actually set in the future of humanity, living on 
Terra
 and 
Mars
. Del and Imogen return into the Hoops with the help of three ballons build by the inhabitants of Jierra. Since they are seen as a threat upon landing, they get shot, but manage to get down safely. Del then once again chases a traitor, who had sabotaged their mission by making the bridge crash and might be from the same group as Orsino, that turned out to try to prevent any contact between the two parts of humanity. She then proudly declares, that there won't be any separation any longer.

In a world with matter being made up of eight different generations of 
leptons
 with each one having twice the mass of the previous one, humans have different sizes organized in seven scales and a Generation Eight currently under research. Every scale has twice the size as their previous scale, hence with Scale One, normal humans, being the largest and Scale Seven, about the size of 
Lego minifigurines
, being the smallest. They mostly separate in their respective district, although cross-scale offspring can happen. Different scales bring unique problems, for example the speed of thought and life expectancy being different or molecules made up of matter of one scale not working for a different scale. Communication inbetween is also difficult since it requires frequency modultation, but there is a universal language known as Panscala. Since for example body volume grows with the third power of the height, there are debates whether resources should be split according to a 
logarithmic
 or 
linear scale
. All of that creates tension between the scales.

Sam Mujrif, a Scale Four detective, is tasked with finding Cara Leon, a Scale One woman, by her sister Jessica Leon. Prior to disappearing, Cara Leon had done trade with electronics in District Four and was also last seen there. Sam Mujrif eventually uncovers that Cara Leon had been kidnapped and made part of an experiment, that kept her underwater in a dome of Scale Seven metal, made with the new technology of lepton engineering. She is saved and reunited with her sister Jessica Leon with her claims hinting that she stumbled upon something she wasn't supposed to see in District Four. Shortly after, a giant blast resembling a 
nuclear explosion
 can be seen all over the different districts and first causes panic. It turns out that District Seven has launched the probe 
Friendship
 around the 
Earth
 and plans to colonize the 
Moon
 and 
Mars
, explaing the experiment with Cara Leon. Although 
Friendship
's orbit is synchronized with the sleep cycles in multiple districts and sends out signals for all scales to see, some people perceive it as a passive-aggressive demonstration of power. It furthermore turns out, that District Seven worked on advancing lepton engineering to be able to transfer genetic information between scales by translating the different analogues of atoms used in their biology into each other. Debates and then a vote are held on the technology, which yields neither victory for or against it, but instead a third option. Sam Mujrif's son tells him to soon going to study in the astronaut program of District Seven, which takes twenty-four students from each district, and not be worried about the common future of the scales.

Alex Benedict receives word from a cousin that his uncle Gabriel was among the passengers on an interstellar that disappeared in Armstrong space. A package arrives from his uncle’s lawyers informing Alex that he is his uncle’s heir and giving Alex a sealed message from his uncle. Alex learns that his uncle had been working on a special archeological project that Alex is to pursue now that his uncle cannot. Alex must return to his uncle's home on Rimway and look in the “Leisha Tanner” file to recover relevant research and notes. The message does not discuss the nature of the project, other than to mention Hugh Scott, an old acquaintance. However, en route to Rimway, Alex learns that his uncle’s house has been burgled and, when he arrives, that the Tanner file is missing and all of his uncle's computerized records have been destroyed.

From this point onward, the story follows two increasingly intertwined threads, a mystery in the present and a history narrated in the backstory. The mystery is the nature of Uncle Gabe’s project, which Alex works to discover. As Alex does so, he becomes increasingly immersed in the history of the Resistance and its principal leader and hero, Christopher Sim. The story switches back and forth between the developing mystery and the historical narrative.

Alex visits the local police inspector and learns that the burglars apparently wanted only the Tanner file. The inspector, a social friend of Alex's uncle, can shed little light on Gabe’s project other than to note that Alex's uncle seemed distracted for the three months before his death and that he had become a “nut” on the subject of Christopher Sim and the Resistance.

Chase Kolpath visits Alex at his uncle's house. Before disappearing, Gabriel Benedict had hired Ms. Kolpath to investigate the last flight of the 
Tenandrome
, Hugh Scott's Planetary Survey ship, and then meet Gabe at a world near the Veiled Lady star cluster and pilot them to an unspecified destination. Alex's uncle disappeared before reaching his destination, and owed Ms. Kolpath a considerable sum. Alex agrees to pay what his uncle owed her and asks her to assist him in his investigations. From the planned logistics of the trip, Ms. Kolpath estimates that they were to travel from 800 to 1,500 light years distance. Chase doesn’t know Gabe’s objective, only that it had something to do with the  
Tenandrome
. That ship had explored the Veiled Lady about three years before Gabe’s death and returned unexpectedly early. “Apparently, they saw something. . . Gabe wanted to know what, but I could never find out.”

Alex researches the 
Tenandrome
 flight but finds no indication of anything unusual besides a mechanical breakdown. He then attempts to visit Hugh Scott, but finds that Scott has been away from home for months. One of his neighbors notes that Scott’s personality has changed since the 
Tenandrome
 flight. Like Alex's uncle, Scott has become obsessed by the Resistance and Christopher Sim.

Alex gradually learns more of the history of the Resistance and is puzzled by the fact that during the war Sim’s forces, and especially Sim himself, appear to have been present and in action at widely separated locations virtually simultaneously. He contacts the local Ashiyyur representative office to review Ashiyyur records of the war, which might shed some light on the problem. Alex meets S’Kalian and experiences mind-to-mind contact for the first time. He learns that the Ashiyyur are aware of the “problem” of Sim’s nearly simultaneous appearances in distant places and account for it as human scholars have done, by assuming that Sim’s fleet included as many as three other Dellacondan vessels disguised as the 
Corsarius
, Sim's ship, as a form of 
psychological warfare
.

Dellaconda itself is the next destination, as Chase and Alex continue their hunt for Hugh Scott. Alex visits Christopher Sim’s home and the school where he taught before the war; both are maintained as shrines to his memory. He locates and meets with Hugh Scott, in spite of Scott’s obvious reluctance. Scott will not say anything about the
Tenandrome
 mission, except to confirm that the survey ship found something and that there was a good reason to keep it secret. Alex startles Scott by guessing that the 
Tenadrome
 had found a Dellacondan warship, but Scott will say no more.

The mystery begins to unravel. Alex and Chase decide that whatever the 
Tenandrome
 found, Lesha Tanner had found it first, 200 years before. Alex has an inspiration – the location of the missing something is obliquely described in a poem by Walford Candles, to whom Tanner must have confided the secret. A collection of Candles' poems, 
Rumors of Earth
, had been in Uncle Gabe’s bedroom when Alex returned, and was open to that poem. Gabriel Benedict must have had the same insight. Alex is able to find the university researcher who helped his uncle work with the clues in Candles’ poem and who identifies a location about 1,300 light years into the Veiled Lady as the primary locus of search.

Alex and Chase rent a ship and begin a two-month journey through Armstrong space. At their destination, they find a red dwarf star with two planets in its habitable zone. One appears to be a terrestrial world and they move toward it. From a distance, they are able to see something artificial orbiting this world. Moving closer, they can see first that it is a ship, then that it is a warship, and then that it is a Dellacondan warship. Finally, they can make out clearly the ship’s insignia – the famous markings of 
Corsarius
, Christoper Sim’s own.

They board the ship and find that the 
Corsarius
 has power and appears functional. Indeed, the ship appears virtually normal, aside from a few mechanical malfunctions due to age. They play back the captain’s log, and unexpectedly find that it ends before the battle at Rigel at which Sim died. They listen to the whole record and hear a Sim’s-eye view of the history of the Resistance. It becomes clear that as time had passed, Sim became increasingly angry at the shortsightedness of the major human worlds and increasingly disturbed by the casualties among “our finest and bravest.” Toward the end, “his anger flared: there will be a Confederacy one day, . . . but they will not construct it on the bodies of my men.”

Gradually, Alex works out the answer. Christopher Sim became disillusioned with the war and wanted to sue for peace. His brother Tarien and other Resistance leaders seized him and marooned him on this planet to keep him from surrendering. Alex confirms this by searching the planet in a lander and finding Sim’s camp. There is no indication there what happened to Sim.

Chase reports from orbit that an Ashiyyur warship is inbound at high speed. Then another appears, slowing to make orbit around Sim's world of exile. Alex warns Chase to abandon their rented ship for the 
Corsarius
; she does so just before the first Ashiyyur warship destroys their rented ship. Alex joins her and learns that the Armstrong drive on the 
Corsarius
 won’t be fully charged for about a day. Their problem is to stay alive until the Armstrong drive is ready. They borrow a classic maneuver from one of Sim’s battles and leave orbit at high speed headed directly toward the incoming Ashiyyur warship, which cannot slow its speed quickly enough to meet them. It uses lasers to disable 
Corsarius'
 magnetic drives; Chase realizes too late that she has forgotten to raise the ship’s shields. The Ashiyyur warship reverses its trajectory and reaches them about ten hours before they can jump. It demands their surrender. Through a strategem, Alex and Chase are able to fire 
Corsarius
’ major weapons at it, damaging it badly and forcing it to flee. Ten hours later, the interstellar drive activates. It is not an Armstrong drive but something else, product of Rashim Machesney’s genius. In an eye blink, 
Corsarius
 is in orbit around Rimway, and safe.

The huge (if temporary) technological advantage conferred on humanity by the new drive ends the human-Ashiyyur rivalry; the Perimeter stabilizes and more peaceful relations develop between the two civilizations.

In an epilogue to the novel, the reader learns, with Hugh Scott, that Christopher Sim did not die on the planet where he was marooned.  Sim was rescued by Leisha Tanner and lived afterward under the assumed identity of Jerome Courtney, spending considerable time as a respected lay brother at a Catholic monastery on an isolated planet. There, he continued to write on various historical and philosophical subjects."

A group of 42,363 Union humans and 
azi
 are dispatched to set up a base on a very rare habitable planet named Gehenna II in the 
Zeta Reticuli
 system. Unknown to the settlers, their mission is designed to fail; they are deliberately abandoned in order to create an unmanageable population for the rival Alliance which is expected to eventually take possession of the system.

The native calibans are first presented as annoying lizard-like creatures constantly moving earth to make incomprehensible patterns. The humans at first attempt to keep them outside a perimeter or to drive them away. In time, larger and larger calibans are seen, with differences in color, size, and a social structure (gray calibans are subservient to the larger brown calibans). It becomes clear that the creatures are capable of communication, at least at the level of symbology, and of developing 
empathic
 or possibly 
telepathic
 links to humans. Eventually a 
symbiosis
 develops, with some of the calibans pairing off with humans.

Over a period of several generations and cut off from resupply, the 
colonists
 lapse into a primitive lifestyle. By necessity, the azi are allowed to raise families. The non-azi humans are in the minority from the beginning and over time, intermarry with the majority. An Alliance mission first seeks to intervene, then withdraws from direct contact, content to watch as two quasi-
feudal
, fundamentally opposed societies develop, while a third, smaller group called the ""Weirds"" becomes much more closely associated with the calibans, living with them rather than the other humans and becoming less comprehensible in the process.

The novel follows several generations of descendants of one azi who establish different lines and rise to become the leaders of two rival cultures. Historical moments depict the decline of the colony, the establishment of human-caliban relations, cultural development, and the planetary environment. Finally, the two cultures, one ""masculine""-aggressive, the other more ""feminine""-receptive, fight for dominance. A Union delegation arrives at the end, to be given short shrift by Elai, the female ruler who has emerged victorious."

The book tells the story in flashbacks during the actual Mars mission of the chronicalised history until the mission's beginning. The 
point of divergence
 for this alternate timeline happens on 22 November 1963, where 
John F. Kennedy
 survived 
the assassination
 (
Jacqueline Kennedy
 was killed, hence the renaming of the 
Kennedy Space Center
 as the Jacqueline B. Kennedy Space Center), but was crippled and thus incapacitated, as 
Lyndon B. Johnson
 is still sworn in. On 20 July 1969, 
Apollo 11
 astronauts 
Neil Armstrong
 and Joe Muldoon walk on the Moon, and Nixon's ""most historic phone call"" is joined by a call from former President Kennedy, committing the United States to send a crewed mission to 
Mars
, which Nixon backs as part of his fateful decision to decide the future of crewed spaceflight, instead of deciding on the 
Space Shuttle
 program as he did in our timeline.

Preparations for this new goal include slashing the number of Moon landings so funding and leftover 
Apollo spacecraft
 hardware can go towards the efforts of the crewed Mars mission. 
Apollo 12
 still lands, 
Apollo 13
 still suffers its disaster, but 
Apollo 14
 is crewed by the astronauts of the cancelled 
Apollo 15
 mission to carry out the 
scientific experiments on the lunar surface
, and is the last crewed Moon landing. At the same time, the 
NERVA
 program is revived to become the chosen Mars spacecraft development, with larger tests in 
Nevada
, but without containment and plagued with engineering problems.

The book centres around chronicling the lives of the future Mars mission astronauts, NASA and contractor personnel all involved in making the mission become a reality, and the shifts within NASA's astronaut and management hierarchy throughout the mission's preparations, including female geologist Natalie York's quest to become an astronaut, and her stormy relationships with fellow astronaut Ben Priest and NERVA engineer Mike Conlig. Other astronauts include Ralph Gershon, a former fighter-bomber pilot involved in illegal bombing missions in Cambodia during the 
Vietnam War
 whose dream is to be the first black man in space, and Phil Stone, a veteran Air Force 
test pilot
-turned-astronaut who has flown in a long-term stay on a lunar orbital station before the Mars mission.

In the 1970s, the 
Skylab
 Space Station is launched, but apparently as a 
wet workshop
 design that is based on the 
Saturn IB
 
S-IVB
 upper stage called 
Skylab A
. The 
Saturn V
 that might have launched Skylab in our timeline instead launches 
Skylab B
, a lunar orbit space station unofficially named ""Moonlab"", also a wet workshop based on the S-IVB. The 
Apollo-Soyuz Test Project
 is instead a series of visits by the 
Apollo Command/Service Module
 to 
Salyut
 space stations, and 
Soyuz
 missions to both Skylab and Moonlab. To facilitate the latter, the Soviets finally finish work on their 
N-1
. The Skylab/Moonlab programs lead to improvements in the design of the Apollo Command/Service Module. A Block III CSM is produced using battery power in place of fuel cells, followed by the Block IV and V, which have a degree of reusability (modular construction and resistance to salt water 
corrosion
). Also chronicled is the development of the experimental '
Mars Excursion Module
' by small aerospace firm Columbia Aviation as it struggles against larger rival contractors of NASA and its engineers working painstakingly against the technical challenges of a working and reliable Mars lander.

A test of the NERVA, called 
Apollo-N
, is finally launched atop the modified Saturn VN, but suffers from 
pogo oscillations
 in the 
S-IC
 first stage. This damages the NERVA upper stage, which catastrophically fails once fired in orbit; despite returning to Earth safely, the entire crew (including Ben Priest) is killed by 
radiation poisoning
, and the space program nearly collapses from hostile political and public opinion against the use of nuclear power in space, and the seemingly unnecessary risks and reasons of a Mars mission.

In the aftermath, a new Mars mission plan dubbed 
Ares
 is drawn up, utilising the upgraded 
Saturn V-B
, which has numerous improvements, including the use of 
solid rocket boosters
 to double its payload. 
Ares
 also uses on-orbit assembly of a different long duration Mars-ship using wet-workshop 
Saturn rocket
 components as the propulsion systems as well as a Skylab habitat module and 
external tanks
 to hold extra fuel. 
Ares
 performs a 
Venus
 flyby reminiscent of the 
Manned Venus Flyby
 
NASA
 planned in the aftermath of the original Apollo program, but done in this timeline for 
gravitational assistance
, and finally lands at 
Mangala Valles
 on 27 March 1986.

However, as a side effect, a number of uncrewed probes – including the 
Viking program
, 
Pioneer Venus project
, 
Mariner 10
, 
Pioneers 10
 and 
11
, and the 
Voyager program
 – are cancelled so that their funding can be redirected to the crewed Mars mission, although another Mariner orbiter is sent to Mars to help prepare for the crewed landing. As a result, although humans walk on Mars, their knowledge of the 
Solar System
, including Mars itself and especially the outer Solar System planets which never get visited without the Pioneer/Voyager missions, is far less than in reality."

Jake Epping is a recently divorced 
high school
 English teacher in 
Lisbon Falls, Maine
, earning extra money teaching a 
GED
 class. Epping gives an assignment to his GED students, asking them to write about a day that changed their lives. One of the students, a 
learning disabled
 janitor named Harry Dunning, submits an assignment describing the night his alcoholic father murdered his mother and siblings with a hammer; the story emotionally affects Jake, and the two become friends after Harry earns his GED.

Two years after reading the essay, Jake is summoned by his friend Al Templeton to the diner Al owns. When Jake arrives at the diner, he is shocked to discover that Al has terminal 
lung cancer
, despite appearing perfectly healthy the night before. Al instructs Jake to step into the back of the diner's 
pantry
, where Jake finds a 
time slip
 leading to Lisbon Falls as it existed on September 9, 1958. After exploring the town, Jake returns to 2011 and learns that the portal leads to the same moment of the same day every time it is used, and that a visitor will always return to the present two minutes after they had left.

Al reveals that he had used the time slip to concoct a plan to prevent 
John F. Kennedy's assassination
, hoping that doing so would stop the 
Vietnam War
 and change history for the better. He spent four years in the past after entering the portal the previous night, traveling to 
Dallas, Texas
, to track 
Lee Harvey Oswald
, plotting to kill the would-be assassin during his attempted murder of General 
Edwin Walker
. However, due to his illness, Al is unable to continue his mission. He recruits a reluctant Jake to complete it.

As an experiment, Jake travels back to 1958 to save Harry's family, who will be killed by his father on 
Halloween
 night. Using the 
alias
 ""George Amberson"", Jake buys a car and travels to Harry's hometown of 
Derry, Maine
, immediately disliking the place. Jake is able to find Harry's father, Frank Dunning, and track his movements. After saving all but one of Harry's siblings from Frank's brutal assault, Jake returns to 2011 hopeful that he improved Harry's life, only to learn that he indirectly caused Harry to die in Vietnam. Soon afterward, Al commits 
suicide
.

Resigned, Jake re-enters the portal, travels back to Derry, and kills Frank while he is visiting a cemetery. After resolving one of Al's other missions—preventing a hunter from accidentally shooting a young girl—Jake makes his way, first to Florida, then to Texas to wait for Oswald's arrival. He eventually settles in Jodie, a town on the outskirts of Dallas, where he becomes a full-time English teacher at a local 
consolidated school
. At the wedding reception of the high school's librarian Mimi Corcoran (who is retiring), Jake meets Sadie Dunhill, the new librarian. After Mimi's death, Jake and Sadie are tasked with organizing a memorial assembly, bringing them closer together. Over time, Sadie and Jake fall in love and begin a relationship. Sadie reveals that her ex-husband, John Clayton, had many odd habits owing to his 
obsessive compulsive disorder
 and was emotionally distant.

Meanwhile, Jake surveils Oswald and his family, renting properties close to them and installing microphones in their apartment. He briefly interacts with 
Marina Oswald
. In the notebook Al gave him, Al states that 
George de Mohrenschildt
 may have been involved in the attempted assassination of Edwin Walker. Jake plans to stalk Oswald on the date of the attempted assassination to see if de Mohrenschildt was present, but Clayton finds Sadie and holds her hostage. Jake arrives at Sadie's house with Deke Simmons, the former principal of the high school and Mimi's widower, rescuing Sadie. Jake stays with Sadie in the hospital as she recuperates and as a result is not able to watch Oswald as he attempts to kill Walker.

As the date of the assassination approaches, Jake gambles on a boxing match and wins, gaining the attention of local businessman Akiva Roth, who visits Jake's house in Dallas with two associates and has them beat Jake. As a result, Jake loses his memories of Oswald and spends weeks in the hospital and in a rehabilitation center. After remembering Al's notebook, Jake retrieves it and forms a plan to kill Oswald inside the 
Texas School Book Depository
 on the day of the assassination. He writes a letter to Sadie asking her not to try to find him for her safety. Sadie nevertheless finds him in 
Fort Worth
 and the pair attempt to make it to Dallas in time. They arrive at the Depository in time for Jake to successfully prevent Oswald from shooting Kennedy. 
Secret Service
 agents shoot Oswald dead, but not before Oswald shoots and kills Sadie.

Jake is regarded as a hero and is thanked by both Kennedy and 
his wife
. Jake returns to Lisbon Falls and is met by ""The Yellow Card Man"" (so called because he wears a yellow card in his hat), who tells him to go back to 2011 and see what he has done.

In 2011, Jake discovers that Earth has become a wasteland after a 
nuclear war
 in 1974, and that natural disasters occur regularly. Through a conversation with Harry, alive in this timeline, he finds out that many historical tragedies such as the 
Jonestown
 incident happened with an increased death toll, and the 
Civil Rights Act of 1964
 was never passed. The planet is on the verge of collapse, and many countries are involved in various recurring wars. Jake goes back to the past and is told by the Yellow Card Man that every trip causes another ""string"", an alternate reality with a different past and different future. These strings overlap and eventually can cause reality to fall apart, as evidenced by what Jake saw when he returned to 2011. The Yellow Card Man says that he is part of a group of people who monitor time slips, and who are often driven to insanity because of the many realities that are created when someone travels to the past. He instructs Jake to return to 2011, allowing the future to return to normal. Jake instead stays in 1958 for some time, contemplating whether to warn Sadie about John Clayton or not.

Jake eventually returns to the future, finding that it has returned to normal. He moves out of Lisbon Falls and finds that Sadie is being celebrated as a ""Citizen of the Century"" in Jodie, and he goes to the party being held. Sadie, now in her eighties, spent the time between 1958 and 2011 doing charity work and served terms as mayor and in the 
Texas legislature
, and is beloved by the people of Jodie. Jake and Sadie share a dance as Jake reminisces on the life they shared.



Alternate ending

Stephen King published an alternate ending on his official website on January 24, 2012, in which Jake finds a November 22, 2013, news article where Sadie has turned 80. She had married a man named Trevor Anderson, with whom she had five children, eleven grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. Before release, this ending was scrapped and swapped for the published version at the suggestion of King's son, writer 
Joe Hill

Gabriel, a minor Aristos, runs a group of planets containing societies devoted to artistic pursuits, assisted by his several daimones, each of whom has his or her own personality and special area of interest. Attending oneirochronon parties and composing operas, having sex with both men and women (at one point, he has sex with two women at once—one in physical reality, one in the oneirochronon), he seems to live a leisurely, decadent life.

An elder Ariste, Cressida, warns Gabriel that something is up in a nearby solar system. There appear to be some extra planets in an area which astronomical surveys had said contained none. Cressida is murdered before she can explain more but Gabriel begins to suspect that Saito, the Aristos whose domain is closest to the mystery solar system, is using it for some undisclosed purpose.

Gabriel and some of his advisers leave on a secret mission to the mystery solar system. When they arrive there they discover a horrifying truth: the planets contain life, human life. The most advanced of the planets contains a society similar in nature and technological development to Renaissance Europe. The people here have been left without the guidance and control of an Aristos and are mired in constant warfare and squalor, perishing of diseases which modern technology can easily cure. Someone, presumably Saito, has created human life here and consigned it to perpetual suffering for some unknown reason.

Horrified by the suffering they see, Gabriel and some of his companions travel down to the planet to investigate. Posing as visitors from a distant country they identify a local nobleman whom they believe to be Saito and arrange a confrontation. While they are waiting for their chance to assassinate Saito they see their spaceship, which had been orbiting the planet, destroyed. Their assassination attempt fails when they realize that the nobleman is actually an artificial lifeform. Gabriel and his companions are captured and imprisoned.

It is then that Gabriel is confronted with the truth: the mastermind behind this horrifying experiment is not Saito, but Captain Yuan, the architect of the current galactic civilization, who had long been presumed dead. Yuan explains his motives behind creating new life: the galactic society of the Logarchy has become staid and stultifying. Protected from any danger, the people have stopped improving and have become slaves of the Aristoi. He created this new solar system and the life within it in order to give a new start to humanity and create a society free from the restrictions of the Logarchy.

Yuan, Saito, and Zhenling, an Ariste whom Gabriel had considered an ally and even taken as a lover, then begin a brainwashing program on Gabriel, eventually breaking his will and convincing him to help them with minor duties on their project. Their plan is foiled when a previously hidden sub-personality of Gabriel, that he dubs The Voice, uses his computer privileges to escape.

Gabriel manages to defeat Saito and escape along with his friends. He informs the rest of the Logarchy about what has happened and rallies them to a war footing. The Logarchy's forces swarm into the new solar system to provide humanitarian relief and begin to integrate the societies into the galactic society. As Yuan's secrets are revealed it is also discovered that he had tampered with the examination process which forms the backbone of the Logarchy, promoting people to Aristoi who he believed could help him and keeping others back. Captain Yuan himself has escaped to parts unknown and Gabriel makes it his life's mission to track him down and bring him to justice. As he does so he is warned by Zhenling, now imprisoned, that in doing so he will only fulfill Yuan's plan to shake up the galactic status quo."

Yeine Darr was born to Kinneth Arameri, who was heir to the Arameri throne but abdicated twenty years before the start of the story to marry Yeine's father, a Darre man. Kinneth was disowned by Dekarta (patriarch of the ruling Arameri family), and Darr blacklisted by the Arameri (throwing the country into a crippling economic crisis) as a result.

The day she arrives, she meets T'vril, the palace steward, who is also an Arameri (although lower-ranked); the entire palace staff down to the floor cleaning servants is Arameri. This is because only Arameri are permitted to pass a night in Sky, for reasons that T'vril does not immediately explain.  T'vril attempts to get Yeine to Viraine—the palace scrivener—to be ""marked"" as an Arameri before nightfall.  However, Scimina, one of the other potential heirs, finds them first.  Because Yeine lacks the mark, she unleashes Nahadoth, one of the Arameri's captive gods, on Yeine.

Yeine flees and is assisted by Sieh, another of the captive gods.  Before they can escape, Nahadoth catches up and attacks Sieh, whereupon Yeine stabs Nahadoth to apparent death with her knife.  Nahadoth kisses her before he falls, saying he has been waiting for her, much to Yeine's confusion.  Being a god, Nahadoth returns to life shortly afterward.  Yeine then meets the other gods—and quickly realizes that they, like the Arameri, have frightening plans for her.

Yeine, however, has her own agenda:  still in mourning, she has come to Sky to determine who may have killed her mother before the start of the story. While attempting to forge an alliance with Relad, her cousin and the other potential heir, she also seeks out answers to the mystery of her mother's past.  This leads Yeine to terrifying revelations about herself, her world's history, and the gods themselves.

As the day of the succession ceremony approaches and Yeine finds herself left with few options, she chooses to ally with the Enefadeh—even though Nahadoth warns her that they want her life in exchange for their assistance.  Determined to learn the truth about her mother even if she dies in the process, she agrees to the gods' bargain.  She also begins brief liaisons with first T'vril, then Nahadoth himself, the latter of whom seems equally drawn to her, though his motives are unclear.

The story culminates with the Arameri Ceremony of the Succession, at which Itempas himself—the Skyfather, ruler of the universe—appears, and Yeine makes a fateful choice."

Protagonist Jack Holloway lives a solitary life mining valuable ""sunstones"" in the wilderness of the planet Zarathustra, managed by Victor Grego's Chartered Zarathustra Company, which built colonial outposts there and now reaps the benefits of the planet's resources. One day, Holloway meets a small golden-furred humanoid whom he names ""Little Fuzzy"", who soon introduces Holloway to his family. Holloway cares for the Fuzzies and spreads word of their apparently intelligent behavior. When the Company discovers that the Fuzzies' intelligence may qualify them as a sapient species, the Company moves against them, as the discovery of sapient native Zarathustrans would turn the planet into a protected aboriginal zone, install a proper government there, and deprive the Company of its complete control of the planet's resources.

Leonard Kellogg, one of Grego's staff, manages a team of scientists working to legally disprove the Fuzzies' sapience at all costs. Holloway suspects Kellogg's intentions and resists him. When Kellogg kills a Fuzzy in anger, Holloway has him charged with murder, leaving the Fuzzies' sapience to be determined in court. In the midst of the proceedings, it is proven that Fuzzies have at least the mental capacity of a ten-year-old human child and speak to each other ultrasonically. Kellogg kills himself in his cell, but the prosecution continues, and the court officially rules that the Fuzzies are sapient beings, invalidating the company's charter. Holloway and his allies are given Fuzzy-related positions in the new government.



Sequels
[
edit
]


The second book, 
Fuzzy Sapiens
, deals with the newly charterless Zarathustra Company and its gradual cooperation with the planet's new governor to ensure chaos does not take over the planet, while the Fuzzies attach themselves to individual human guardians including members of the Company staff. Victor Grego, one of the villains of the first book and the manager of the CZC, finds a Fuzzy in his private apartment in the Company tower, adopts him, names him Diamond, and become a firm supporter of the Fuzzies. This enables the company to cooperate with the new planetary government headed up by naturalist Ben Rainsford and work with the Native Affairs Commission headed up by Jack Holloway. It becomes clear that criminals are using the irregular status of the government and of the company to attack it and steal sunstones. With the help of the Fuzzies, the thieves are thwarted. There is also further exploration into the biology of the Fuzzies, and it is established that the Fuzzies may be in a biological dead end, doomed to extinction without aid from the humans.

The third book, 
Fuzzy Bones
 by 
William Tuning
, suggests that the remarkable affinity of all Fuzzies for the survival ration ""Extraterrestrial Type Three"" (a.k.a. ""Extee 3"", ""estefee"", or ""hoksu-fusso"", meaning ""wonderful food"") does not coincide with the composition of Zarathustran soil, a contradiction of Garrett's Theorem. A third significant Fuzzy character is developed called Starwatcher. Little Fuzzy, Diamond, and Starwatcher become the clear leaders in working with humans. Among other things, an alien spaceship is discovered on Beta Continent, and evidence that the Fuzzies are not in fact native to Zarathustra  emerges, which raises a variety of legal and philosophical questions. Tuning introduces a number of memorable characters, including Christiana Stone, Grego's Fuzzy-Sitter-in-Chief; Reverend Thomas Aquinas Gordon, aka ""The Rev;"" Master Gunnery Sergeant Philip Helton, TFMC; and Liana Bell, a CZC scientist invited by the researchers of Holloway's Fuzzy Institute to join them in their research.

Golden Dream
 by 
Ardath Mayhar
 fits with these three books in terms of the general plot and relationships. Essentially, it is 
Little Fuzzy
 told from the point of view of the Fuzzies rather than that of the humans.

After these two official sequels, the original third book by Piper himself, 
Fuzzies and Other People
, offers an alternative future wherein Little Fuzzy himself is separated from Jack Holloway and introduces a band of Fuzzies led by Wise One to the combined society. It explores the deepening relationships between the characters already introduced in Piper's first two books, and shows how the Fuzzies fit in with the humans on Zarathustra."

artificial intelligence
 named H.A.R.L.I.E., also referred to by the proper name ""HARLIE""—an 
acronym
 for Human Analog Replication, Lethetic Intelligence Engine (originally Human Analog Robot Life Input Equivalents).

HARLIE's story revolves around his relationship with David Auberson, the psychologist who is responsible for guiding HARLIE from childhood into adulthood.  It is also the story of HARLIE's fight against being turned off, and the philosophical question of whether or not HARLIE is 
human
; for that matter, what it 
means
 to be human.

When HARLIE Was One
 contains one of the

John Perry and Jane Sagan, the former Ghost Brigade clone of Perry's dead wife, who in the meantime settled on the planet Huckleberry, are offered positions as leaders of the new colony of Roanoke, which will comprise a first wave of human settlers from the first ten established extraterrestial human colonies. After deliberating, they decide to accept and travel with Zoë to the new colony. In tow are Zoë's Obin protectors, named Hickory and Dickory, who view her with almost religious awe due to her father's success in giving the Obin consciousness using a brain implant.

Upon arriving, the colonists quickly realize they are not at the planet originally assigned to them. They are approached by a Gameran member of the Special Forces of the Colonial Defence Forces (CDF), adapted to live in space, who had attached himself to the exterior of their craft. He informs them they have no option but to land and start colonising anyway. The ship has been irreparably sabotaged by the CDF to prevent the craft from leaving orbit, and all the colonists as well as the ship's crew are considered quarantined from the rest of the Colonial Union against their will. The Conclave, an alliance of more than 400 alien species, that wants to stop humanity's expansion, was allegedly aware of the original position of Roanoke, and therefore was waiting to annihilate them. To stress their point, he shows the colonists some video footage of a Whaidian colony being destroyed by the Conclave. He further tells them that to isolate them fully, they are forbidden from using any advanced technology based on wireless communication, because it could be traced by the enemy. This is offset by the presence of the Mennonites, an 
Amish
-like group of colonists who are familiar with the large amount of basic machinery that the CDF had given the colonists. The deserted space ship is ultimately destroyed by crashing into the surface of the planet. Jane Sagan finds out that her body has been secretly upgraded with Speacial Forces abilties against her will by General Szilard, commander of the Special Forces.

The colony proceeds with surprisingly little initial difficulty. Several colonists are killed by stone-age-level werewolf-like creatures who view them as potential prey, but otherwise the humans begin to settle into the colony. Trying to find out if the Colonial Union withheld critical information about Roanoke, they also reconstruct the unedited video of the Conclave's attack on the Whaidian colony. It becomes clear that the Conclave was hoping not having to erase the settlement, and that their aim is multiracial colonisation of planets. After a certain length of time, the colonists are again visited by Special Forces, who inform them that the plan has partially succeeded, and the initial restrictions on technology have been lifted. The Union attempted to destabilize the Conclave by making them appear incompetent, due to their inability to find a single colony despite a year's worth of searching.

After a brief interlude when their location is leaked to the Conclave, they are visited by the Conclave fleet, consisting of a single ship from every member race of the Conclave. The Conclave leader, General Tarsem Gau, who also appeared in the video, begs John to either give up the colony or secede from the Union and join the Conclave. John refuses, and asks General Gau to surrender. Baffled, the General tells John to make his peace, and orders the Conclave fleet to open fire. Almost immediately, the entire fleet is annihilated. Special Forces members, during the prior year, had methodically tracked down every ship in the Conclave fleet and attached a remotely triggered antimatter bomb to the hull. The Gamaran officer who accompanied the Roanoke colonists then waited for every Conclave ship to arrive before detonating the 
mines
, sparing the leader's craft. Gau understands that John secretly tried to warn him. The event shatters the Conclave into multiple factions, several of which swear vengeance on the Union. Jane staves off an attempted attack on the planet from one faction, remotely controlling the colony's defense lasers, although some people are killed.

After the attack, John is ordered to Phoenix Station and faces an inquiry for misconduct by almost ruining the plan to destroy the enemy fleet when asking General Gau to surrender. He is eventually absolved, and after speaking with General Szilard, returns to Roanoke. The General has told him that he influenced the verdict and that Roanoke is a sacrificial pawn. If the Roanoke colony is destroyed, enlistment in the CDF will spike using the destruction of the colony as a rally cry, allowing for a more aggressive campaign against the other alien races. This however will cause humanity's eventual extinction through a war of attrition. General Szilard wants to prevent that. He also informs John of a planed assassination attempt on General Gau by a close ally.

John advises the colonists to declare Roanoke independant, but is overruled. He can avert the murder of Genaral Gau by sending Zoë as an emissary, which consolidates Gau's role as leader, abdicates the leadership of Roanoke, because his action represent an act of treason towards the Colonial Union, and joins the Conclave, after being awarded a ship by them as his sovereign domain, with help from the Obin. Together with other members of the Conclave, he visits Earth, which is kept isolated from the rest of the galaxy by the Colonial Union and where he is actually forbidden to return, to reveal what has been befalling the rest of the universe and to update them on the Conclave's level of technology.

The Colonial Union is thrown into disarray, with enlistment plummeting and potential colonists demurring, but the end of the book suggests that bringing Earth into the Union properly will allow for more diplomatic solutions and cooperation between species."

The Colonial Defense Forces (CDF) learn by 
torture
 from a captured Rraey scientist that one of their top consciousness transfer scientists, Charles Boutin, has turned traitor and sparked an unprecedented alliance between three other species, the Rraey, the Enishan and the Obin, to wipe out humanity. While investigating Boutin's clumsy attempt to fake his own death, the CDF discovers that Boutin had successfully stored a copy of his consciousness in a computer. The colonial Special Forces, nicknamed ""The Ghost Brigades,"" create a CDF soldier body with Boutin's DNA, retrieved from his cloned decoy corpse, trying to implant the copy of Boutin's consciousness into the new brain, in order to learn where Boutin has escaped to and what his intentions really are. After the attempt seemingly fails, the soldier named Jared Dirac (after 
Paul Dirac
) becomes a private in the Special Forces and is assigned to a platoon commanded by Jane Sagan. On the off chance that Boutin's consciousness does emerge, Sagan and her superiors are determined to keep an eye on Jared. Time passes and an experience that reminds Dirac of Boutin's assumed dead daughter Zoë leads Boutin's consciousness to emerge. Jared slowly becomes more and more like Boutin while losing his own personality traits, but retains his individuality and his strong moral opposition to Boutin's philosophy and actions. When the extent of Boutin's treachery becomes known, it's clear there will be some difficult choices required to stop Boutin's alliance with the three alien races.

A mission to the moon where Boutin is helping the Obin build their consciousness transfer technology, led by Sagan and Dirac, is catastrophically compromised by Boutin's use of a backdoor to disable the soldiers' BrainPals and render many of them catatonic. Dirac is interrogated by Boutin, who decides to transfer his own consciousness into Dirac's body in an attempt to infiltrate and destroy the Colonial Union using a BrainPal computer virus. Dirac learns that the Obin probably have been given intelligence by the Consu, but without any self awareness, which they now crave and Boutin promised to give them, and that Zoë is still alive, and can send that information to Sagan, before the transfer succeeds, ending Dirac's consciousness. Dirac is able to posthumously neutralize Boutin by leaving a 
Trojan horse
 in a BrainPal message, oxidizing his body's smart blood and killing him. Boutin's daughter Zoë is retrieved by the survivors of the mission, including Sagan. At the end of the book, Sagan is offered retirement in order to keep her from disclosing sensitive information she received from Boutin; she accepts and retires with her future husband John Perry, adopting Zoë. The Obin proceed to sign a treaty with the CDF that ends hostilities."

Originally, Drake is a professional musician, with minor celebrity. When his wife Ana is diagnosed with an unspecified incurable brain disorder, Drake exhausts every option attempting to cure her. Only then does he decide to have her body 
cryogenically
 stored, in the hopes future generations will discover an effective treatment. However, Drake is extremely cautious, and in case the future culture doesn't care about her plight, he has himself frozen as well. Furthermore, he devotes all his energies for a decade before his freezing to becoming an expert primary source on the musically notable people of his era. He correctly assumes that if you become the world's foremost expert in any subject, eventually someone will want to write a book on that exact subject. At that time the hypothetical future writer will want to awaken Drake, and he can in turn awaken his wife, if treatment is available. He is awakened in the year 2512. Although society is vastly different, no cure for Ana yet exists. He spends six years apprenticed to a musical historian to pay for his reviving costs and to gain a foothold in this new world.

Drake is continually laid dormant and revived, progressively later into the future, all the way until the time of the 
Big Crunch
. Human civilization alters radically over the eons, but Ana's mangled brain proves an extremely difficult problem. Despite the incomprehensible changes surrounding him in each successive awakening, Drake never loses sight of his mission.

Eventually, in the extremely remote 
posthuman
 future a few billion years later, Drake's original biological body has disintegrated, despite the cryogenic treatment, and he has become an 
uploaded consciousness
, though still in stasis. At this point the descendants of humanity have colonized the entire Milky Way galaxy, yet an inexplicable threat is wiping out their colonies in a widening arc. The leaders of this civilization have exhausted every answer they can conceive of and have no information as to even the cause of the threat. Their last hope is Drake, an ancient holdover, who may have ideas new to them—namely, war.

The main problem is that the beings have no idea what is happening because the planets wiped out seem exactly the same, but they do not respond to signals, and outside communication is impossible. All probes sent do not return, nor do they reply once they reach the surface of the planet.

Drake becomes the commander of the residents of the galaxy, in designing weapons and defenses, ideas that have long vanished from the minds of these beings. At this time, their technology allows for extremely powerful and deep manipulation of matter at a fundamental scale. An experimental technology called the caesura is used as the plot device to carry the novel. It is a means of instantaneous teleportation using exotic physics, which has by now developed to a stage where it will have no meaning to the causal being. This caesura is not guaranteed teleportation but has a low chance of succeeding.

Billions upon billions of copies of Drake are thus sent out to the planets on the border of the invasion, and by means of the caesura they are teleported back to the base to collect information about the threat. Eventually it is discovered that the threat is an exotic interplanetary type of plant life with spores that migrate between systems. These plants do not intentionally destroy the living beings on the planet, but as a result of their growth they do so.

After the cause of the problem is found, the posthumans decide that the militant Drake is no longer needed or deemed a positive influence—he is seen as too warlike. They tell him to merge with all the returning Drake copies, of which there are billions. This he agrees to, and over billions of years, he collates those copies—forming a collective mind of copies of himself. In one subplot, a version of himself was randomly teleported by the caesura to a distant galaxy, and he manages to return over a few billion years.

Finally, the collective version of Drake resolves to use the 
Omega Point
 to gain complete knowledge of everything and to restore Ana. The story ends on an ambiguous note as Ana is potentially revived, and they seek to create a new universe by means of the caesura to live in.

their treasures
. Elen implies that the girl is the daughter of one of the Tuath, and that Elen stole Dagda's Cauldron before fleeing into the wilderness with her daughter. As the girl grows, she develops the ability to move unseen and to communicate with animals. She uses these abilities to save a group of knights from bandits; these knights are Companions in service to 
King Arturus
 of 
Caer Leon
. The girl decides to leave her mother and explore the world, searching for something she isn't sure of. Elen names her Peretur after the Tuatha's spear; she then casts a 
geas
 which prevents Peretur from speaking of her childhood.

Peretur disguises herself as a boy and travels toward Caer Leon, following visions of a magical lake. She challenges 
Cei
, the king's reeve, and disarms him; he presents her before Arturus and 
Gwenhwyfar
. Arturus declines to accept Peretur as a knight because she is unable to reveal her parentage. Peretur meets 
Nimuë
, Arturus's chief counsellor and the keeper of the lake that Peretur has been seeing in her visions. Entering Nimuë's magical realm, Peretur accidentally breaks Elen's geas.

Nimüe reveals that 
Myrddyn
, the king's sorcerer, was seeking the treasures of the Tuath Dé. While powerful, these treasures will eventually corrupt their mortal owners. Myrddyn helped Arturus to find the Sword 
Caledfwylch
 as well as the 
Stone
, which can seal things away from the mortal world. Nimüe was horrified by Myrddyn's lust for power, so she trapped him in a magical coma and sealed him within the Stone. Nimüe plans to remove the treasures from the world to protect humanity.

Nimüe and Peretur make love. Peretur learns that her father 
Manandán
 is seeking both Elen and the Cauldron. Elen sends out a cry which is sensed by many mortals; Arturus's Companions begin having dreams of the 
Holy Grail
. Peretur tells Arturus that she is Myrddyn's nephew; he allows her to accompany Nimüe and 
Llanza
 to search for the Grail. The group rides to Peretur's childhood home and find that Elen has committed suicide rather than be found by Manandán. Peretur and her father fight; she kills him with his own spear and claims the weapon for herself. Nimüe is stabbed by Manandán in the commotion, but Peretur heals her with the power of the bowl. With his sister Elen's death, Myrddyn dies as well.

The searchers return to Caer Leon and tell Gwenhwyfar to drink from the bowl in order to heal her infertility. In truth, Nimuë and Peretur have replaced the bowl with a fake. The real one is sealed with the Stone in order to keep Arturus from producing an heir. Nimüe believes that Arturus would have spawned a line of tyrannical rulers, but allowing his lineage to die out will bring peace. Peretur holds Nimüe in her arms as they discuss whether they made the right choice."

After hir

 grandmother dies, Enae Athtur is forced to leave the family home. Sie is assigned to track down a Presger Translator who disappeared in human territory 200 years ago. Hir superiors do not expect any new results, but need to reopen the case to prevent it from being used politically against humanity during the treaty renegotiation. Regardless, Enae begins a thorough investigation.

Reet is an 
adoptee
 with no information about his biological family. He suffers from urges to vivisect or consume other humans. Reet is told by members of the Hikipi, a 
diasporal
 ethnic minority, that he could be a lost descendant of their royal family. Many Hikipi believe that the Presger are a hoax created by the Radchaai
[
b
]
 to maintain their cultural supremacy over other human groups. Reet accepts the Hikipi beliefs to advance his status and fulfill a need for community and belonging.

Qven is a juvenile Presger Translator. As part of their life cycle, Translator juveniles must “match”, a process by which they will completely merge with another Translator to form one or two adult bodies. It is originally planned for Qven to be merged into a single body of Translator Dlar to extend Dlar's lifespan. However, the plan is scrapped after a rival juvenile attempts to forcibly match with Qven, resulting in a dangerous and traumatic partial merge. Qven learns that juveniles must match, or else they will die young.

Enae follows a lead to Rurusk Station, where Reet is assigned as hir liaison. When sie examines Reet’s DNA to test the Hikipi theory, sie discovers he is not royalty at all, but rather a descendant of the missing Translator. When Enae’s report is published, Reet is arrested and detained by Translators at the Presgers’ Treaty Administration Facility. Enae helps Reet's parents legally pursue his freedom. Meanwhile, Qven is ordered to match with Reet, since the Translators consider Reet disposable. Reet befriends Qven by teaching em
[
c
]
 about human culture, but both desire to maintain their individuality. Dlar offers the pair a career maintaining the Presgers' system of portals if they willingly match, but threatens them with death if they appeal to the other species and fail.

Various interest groups debate whether to classify Reet as legally human. The Radchaai wish to define human as narrowly as possible in order to weaken AI rights; this also means that they would turn Reet over to the Translators. Other species and humans with nonhuman citizenship offer support for Reet both out of compassion and because the case could shift the balance of treaty politics. Qven and Reet are summoned before a committee composed of various sentient species and their ambassadors. Both Reet and Qven claim to be human. The hearing is interrupted when a Hikipi protester stabs Dlar. One of Dlar's bodies is able to transport many of the committee into a 
pocket dimension
 but is severely injured. Simultaneously, a Hikipi ship threatens to attack the facility. The threat causes a crisis, since the Presger would interpret an attack as hostile action by humanity at large.

Reet, Qven and Enae are trapped within Dlar's dimension, but Qven learns how to open the Presgers' portals. They use the portals to navigate the pocket dimension's 
non-Euclidean space
 and rescue the trapped ambassadors and staff. The committee decides Reet and Qven are both human. Qven opens a portal for security forces to assault the Hikipi ship. Reet is nearly killed by a Hikipi but is saved by Qven. Having grown close, Reet and Qven decide to merge into a single entity spread across two bodies.

Charlie Fitzer, ex-business reporter, spouse, and caregiver to his now-deceased father, is in reduced circumstances. Now living with his cats Hera and Persephone in the old family home co-owned with his half-siblings who are keen to sell it, he barely makes a living as a substitute teacher. He aspires to acquire a revered local tavern whose owner is retiring but is denied a bank loan.

When his long-estranged uncle Jake Baldwin, billionaire owner of a parking lot empire, dies, Jake's assistant Mathilda Morrison approaches Charlie with a proposition: represent Jake at the memorial service, and he will receive enough money from the estate to buy out his siblings, get his loan, and realize his dream.

The funeral is attended by various dubious individuals who have a bizarre obsession with confirming Jake's death; one attendee, Tobias, even attempts to stab the corpse. Afterwards, Charlie's house is destroyed by a bomb. An intruder, later found to be a government agent, is blown up with it, and Charlie is framed for the deed. Mathilda and Charlie's cats reveal that Jake's parking lot holdings were a front for his real career as a 
supervillain
. Mathilda was his chief assistant, and cats Hera and Persephone are genetically modified super-intelligent spy cats, who had long kept watch on Charlie for Jake. Moreover, Jake had enemies, who are now Charlie's enemies: the Lombardy Convocation, an organization of rival villains with whom he has long fought a private war.

Charlie, Mathilda and the cats take refuge on Saint Genevieve, Jake's 
Caribbean
 island hideout in 
Grenada
, powered by 
geothermal energy
 from an active 
volcano
 and guarded by intelligent 
dolphins
. Charlie's companions brief him in preparation for an unavoidable meeting with the Lombardy Convocation at the 
Grand Bellagio Hotel
 on 
Lake Como
, Italy. There he is pressured to join and pay a substantial membership fee or face severe consequences. However, a private meeting with Anton Dobrev, head of the Convocation, ends up with the latter apparently dead, the hotel burned, and Charlie once again being framed.

Back at St. Genevieve, Charlie and his allies prepare for the inevitable showdown. He retaliates for an attack on the island by Roberto Gratas, the new head of the Convocation, by destroying his enemies' 
spy satellite
 with a 
space laser
, severing their communications with a pod of genetically enhanced 
whales
 used to attack the island. An apparent accommodation is reached: Charlie agrees to hand over 
Nazi war plunder
 stored by Jake in exchange for peace. The plan takes a turn during the meeting to access the treasure when Gratas betrays his associates and kills them. However, the cache is discovered to be empty, and Gratas's retaliatory efforts against Charlie's staff are foiled. Charlie's dolphins, having pledged allegiance to him after settling a strike on terms favorable to them, suborn the enemy whales. Gratas attempts to eliminate Charlie but is stopped and taken out by the dolphins.

Concluding that he is unsuited for a life of villainy, Charlie learns he was a 
stalking horse
 in a plot by Jake, his allegedly deceased ally Anton Dobrev, and Mathilda to dismantle the Convocation. As part of his exit, Charlie is exonerated, awarded a safe house for his cats, gains ownership of the tavern, and is eventually reunited with his cats, who also retire from the supervillain business."

Dante

Divine Comedy

In the 2030s in the United States, teenager Otty, and her friends, Gomery, Kath, Cess and Allie communicate with each other via a private internet they built to avoid being spied on by the authorities. California has issued a

The authorities want access to the group's network, but the pair refuse to give it to them. War breaks out between the Government and the Freedom Militia and the country quickly degenerates into chaos. Gomery escapes and Otty is released after she is abandoned by her captors. Otty reunites with Allie and learns that they are the sole survivors of their group. It is revealed that Allie is an advanced

The story begins with the emergence from 
pupation
 of the protagonist, Flora 717, who faces prejudice and abuse throughout the story on account of her despised status. She is, however, larger and darker than most Flora, and born able to speak. For these reasons, the fertility police plan to kill her, but a cold and rainy summer has left the hive short-handed, and the priestess Sister Sage intervenes to save the talented heroine. Sister Sage sets Flora 717 to work in the nursery, feeding 
royal jelly
 (referred to by the bees as ""flow"") to the larvae. There Flora witnesses the fertility police destroying eggs laid by any bee other than the Queen, as well as any bee suspected of laying those eggs. Refusing to co-operate with the fertility police, Flora is threatened with execution but again saved by Sister Sage, who sends her to work in Sanitation. In this role, Flora encounters various areas of the hive (such as the Fanning Hall, where 
nectar
 is reduced into 
honey
) and sections of hive society (such as the drones, who are entitled, demanding, adored by the sisters, and given to sexual harassment; Flora narrowly avoids being raped). Flora's work as a corpse-bearer takes her out of the hive for the first time.

Flora takes a central role in killing an attacking wasp and is rewarded with an audience with the Queen. The Queen's ladies in waiting take Flora to the Holy Library, a hexagonal chamber the scents of whose walls contain six key chapters in the collective memory of the hive. Flora gets to read its scent panels, learning of predators outside the hive, ""the Kindness"" (the practice of killing infirm, deviant, or elderly bees), what the reader recognises as the robbery of honey by humans, and other phenomena which she struggles to comprehend. Flora learns that the Queen is not in good health, before being chased away by the ladies in waiting.

Hurt by her separation from the Queen and finding herself unable to participate in Devotion, Flora aspires to become a forager. Before she does, disaster strikes the foragers when they collect pollen from a field of 
rape
 that has been doused with pesticide, bringing illness and polluted food into the hive. The venerable forager Lily 500, who had signalled this food source to other foragers before the pesticide was sprayed, is unfairly killed by the fertility police, but before her death she is able to transmit her store of foraging data to Flora.

At this point, the story begins to alternate between two aspects of Flora's life. To her own surprise, Flora lays an egg, experiencing maternal affection despite knowing that it is forbidden; this is followed later in the book by a second and then a third egg. One thread of the narrative therefore concerns Flora's efforts to bring an offspring to pupation. Flora tries to enable the birth of her first offspring by sneaking the egg into the nursery. This is found and destroyed by the fertility police, and Flora witnesses another bee being killed on suspicion of laying it. Learning to make beeswax to form a cradle, she finds a hidden place in which to lay her second egg, but it is destroyed when the hive's human cultivator intrudes at the end of the season to remove honeycomb.

Shortly after laying her first egg, Flora is required to become a forager due to the poor summer, the loss of foragers to pesticide, and her acquisition of Lily 500's data. The second thread of the narrative, then, concerns Flora's foraging expeditions. She is very successful and frequently shows other foragers how to find food by performing 
waggle dances
. Flora's foraging expeditions see her fleeing crows, escaping a trap laid by wasps, colliding with a mobile phone mast, receiving prophetic wisdom from spiders, and exploring a conservatory.

As winter closes in, the sister bees, following the instructions of the Hive Mind, slaughter those drones that have not successfully mated outside the hive and then form a 
winter cluster
. Flora discovers that the least obnoxious drone, Sir Linden, has survived the cull, injured, and enables him to hide in the cluster and survive. The cluster is briefly disturbed by the incursion of a mouse, which the bees kill and embalm in 
propolis
.

As winter goes on, evidence that the Queen is seriously ill grows, and as spring begins Flora identifies that the Queen is a source of sickness in the hive. The fertility police have a Thistle execute the Queen, and the hive moves into a period of internal strife. Flora lays her third egg and this time successfully hides it and brings it to pupation. Sister Sage realises that Flora has given birth, but Flora kills her, disposing of the body with the help of Sir Linden.

As the disorder in the hive grows, several ""princesses"" (
virgin queens
) are born to different kin and begin to fight to the death. A Sage princess is winning until Flora's child, who turns out also to be a princess, emerges and kills her to become the new Queen. Immediately after, the hive faces an unstoppable attack by wasps, and Flora helps her daughter lead the colony in a 
swarm
; her daughter mates with Sir Linden; and they find a new home, in a hollow in a beech tree. Flora's life implicitly ends at this point."

Hayden Griffin is a young, fatherless boy living in Aerie. Though exactly when or how his father died is never discovered, Hayden continually says that he was murdered by Slipstream, a rival nation migrating through Virga. Slipstream's sun is tethered to a migrating asteroid that has provided the nation with its wealth. As Slipstream follows its sun, it occasionally moves through other nation's territories, as it does with Aerie, Hayden Griffin's home nation. In these cases, it uses its military headed by a leader simply known as ""the Pilot"" to make this nation a client nation of Slipstream, only to leave these nations again when the asteroid moves far enough. His parents' ambition was to liberate Aerie from Slipstream's rule by constructing their own sun in secret. After his father's death, Hayden's mother made this her final goal in life. At the opening of the story, Aerie's sun is nearly finished, and the construction team was planning a test to assure of its functionality. Hayden gets out of his job as an apprentice in a kitchen, intending to watch the test from a jet bike. However, airships flying Slipstream's flag appear on the horizon and begin to attack the new sun. Aerie's resistance starts to defend themselves from the assault, but don't appear to be a true match against the highly trained Slipstreamers. In a suicidal last-ditch effort, Hayden's mother and the construction crew start the sun while inside of it, incinerating the ships attacking the sun itself but allowing at least one reported Slipstream ship to have escaped. During the fighting, Hayden is thrown off the town's spinning wheel and, as the first chapter leaves him, floating weightlessly in the darkness, where pirates call home and no suns or true governments have been established.

Years later, the story picks up again with Venera Fanning (wife of Admiral Chaison Fanning of Slipstream fame) and her page walking down the hall to the office of the Admiralty in Rush, capital of Slipstream. Venera reminisces on another times, years ago, when she was walking down this hall and a bullet ripped through her jaw line, and she was left bleeding on the floor with no one around. She enters the office, and then continues to the bathroom, where she holds a secret meeting with an informant and a few others. Bleeding and exhausted, the informant shows Venera pictures of a secret dock and ship building facility of a rival nation, Falcon Formation, in a sargasso, which is an area where there is a build up of toxic gases that no one can enter without a specially designed sargasso suit. One of the pictures shows a frightfully large dreadnought approximately 3 km in length, as well as many other warships. Venera leaves the meeting and returns to her waiting page. As they walk out of the crowded office, the page accidentally bumps into Venera, knocking the pictures out of her hands. Venera then catches the page staring at the pictures of the dreadnought as they collect them off the floor. After she dismisses it as awe, they step outside, when the page gives his approximation and explanation of the length of the dreadnought. After the page flies Venera back to the Fanning household, he curses himself for his failure to get inside the house, and the page is revealed to be Hayden Griffin, who intends to kill Admiral Fanning for revenge. However, Griffin learns that Fanning was not present in Slipstream's attack of Aerie.

Admiral Fanning is instructed by the Slipstream Pilot to move his fleet against Mavery but decides to divert part of the fleet including the ship 
Rook
 to attack the hidden Falcon Formation ship dock. Instead of moving there directly, Fanning decides to make a detour in order to recover the fabled treasure of Antene, the map to which is hidden in the 
Winding Tree of Fate
 artifact which, in turn, is stored in a station on Virga's skin.

On the Rook, Griffin learns that the ship's armorer, Aubri Mahallan, is from outside Virga. She explains that the outside world is governed by 
Artificial Nature
, apparently an artificial intelligence possessing vast power. However, some systems of Candesce, Virga's largest sun, disrupt Artificial Nature and prevent it from entering Virga.

While passing icebergs that formed on the inside of Virga's skin, the fleet is attacked by winter pirates which are repelled by dislodging icebergs that then are drawn by gravity towards the center of Virga. During the fight, the Rook is boarded by pirates. Venera Fanning kills the Rook's captain and some of its crew as they try to scuttle the ship. Both Venera Fanning and Mahallan are taken prisoner by the pirate captain 
Dentius
 but regain control of the ship later.

After retrieving the Tree of Fate, Admiral Fanning reveals that the treasure of Antene includes the key to Candesce and therefore means to turn off Candesce's disruption systems. He intends to temporarily shut off these systems in order to use radar while fighting Falcon Formation's ships. Mahallan is building the radar units.

The treasure of Antene is located in Leaf's Choir, a sargasso near Gehellen. On the way, Mahallan explains to Griffin that Admiral Fanning had opposed the destruction of Aerie's sun. It was Slipstream's Pilot who led the attack, later presenting Fanning as the head behind it. Mahallan also explains that she was exiled to Virga because of her trying to overthrow Artificial Nature. Mahallan and Griffin become lovers.

Having retrieved the key to Candesce, Venera Fanning, Mahallan, and Griffin eventually gain control of the sun while Admiral Fanning fights Falcon Formation. Mahallan disables Candesce's countermeasures, enabling Fanning to hit Falcon Formation hard. However, he is forced to steer his ship into the Formation's dreadnought. In Candesce, it is revealed that Mahallan is wired by Artificial Nature, forcing her to keep the countermeasures down. This enables Artificial Nature to invade Virga. Fanning kills Mahallan and re-enables Candesce's countermeasures.

Griffin flees from Candesce which is about to re-ignite. He wants Fanning to accompany him but she declines, fearing that he wants to kill her as revenge for her killing his lover. At the last moment, she clings to Griffin's bike, to launch off it later after steering clear of the sun."

On a desolate planet named the End of Nothing at the edge of the 
galaxy
, a group of robots and their human assistants form the religious institution called Vatican 17. This group is engaged in a secret project to create the ultimate infallible Pope, a supercomputer robot containing all knowledge that can be gathered from this universe and other 
dimensions
.

Some of this information comes from human 
psychics
 called Listeners who can travel mentally to other planets and dimensions. Their experiences are recorded on ""knowledge cubes"" and eventually fed into the Pope. Based on the Pope's interpretation of all knowledge both material and spiritual the robots hope to establish a truly universal religion.

A religious crisis occurs when one of their listeners called Mary claims to have found 
heaven
. The ""theological faction"" of robots petition to have Mary 
canonized
. But another robot faction doubts the authenticity of Mary's heaven. The Vatican fears an end to the search program. Mary is taken ill and cared for by the newcomer Dr. Jason Tennyson. When he arrives on the planet he quickly befriends Jill Roberts, a reporter who wants to write a formal history of the 
Colony
.

While exploring the new planet Tennyson meets Thomas Decker, who is usually accompanied by Whisperer. Whisperer is a member of a species who were native to the planet. He has the ability to speak to Decker and soon finds out that he can communicate 
telepathically
 more easily with Tennyson than with Decker.

Decker tells Tennyson that he thinks he knows where Mary's heaven is. Meanwhile, Decker is murdered by one of the theological faction robots in order to keep its location secret. Tennyson, Jill and Whisperer discover the location of Mary’s heaven from the equation people, aliens from another dimension. They met several unique and strange aliens, including a triad of aliens consisting of a haystack with 13 eyes, a bubble named Smokey and an octopus-like creature in constant motion nicknamed Plopper. To their surprise, they also meet Decker or rather a duplicate of him. Mary's heaven turns out to be a type of center for galactic studies that collects physical samples of life forms from all over the galaxy. Tennyson and the others struggle to get back to Vatican with proof that Mary’s heaven is this galactic library, not the real heaven.

The group is transported back to the End of Nothing, including the triad of aliens, thus providing proof that Mary's heaven is not the real heaven. The 
Cardinals
 in the Vatican accept this evidence and the Search Program is restored.

DryCo has sent two operatives, retired 
African-American
 general Luther and his white bodyguard Jake, to 
post-communist
 
Moscow
, where rival 
multinational corporation
 Krasnaya dominates Russian society through consumer capitalist mass production of products. However, Luther and Jake discover that Krasnaya has two highly advanced 
quantum physicists
 under duress, Oktobriana Osipova and Alekine. The two Dryco mercenaries manage to abduct Oktobriana, but their escape sends them back to 1939 in a 
conservative
 alternate history.

In this world, 
Abraham Lincoln
 was 
killed
 by a 
Baltimore
 pro-
slavery
 mob in 1861 CE, so the 
American Civil War
 never happened, and 
Theodore Roosevelt
 abolished 
slavery
 in 1907 due to European pressure on 
J.P. Morgan
, who feared loss of his European financial assets. On February 15, 1933, 
Giuseppe Zangara
 assassinated 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
, and 
Winston Churchill
 died from a car accident in 1931. As a result of Roosevelt's premature death, it is noted that 
John Nance Garner
 proved to be a 
fiscal conservative
, leading to a situation where much of the western United States had to threaten civil war to obtain economic relief from the ongoing 
Depression
. As the novel progresses, Alekhine, actually a Krasnaya operative, abducts 
Joseph Stalin
 from 
Moscow
, to be transferred to Krasnaya custody and kept in a 
dacha
, in a future which has abandoned 
communism
 and uses the image of ""
Big Boy
"" as nostalgic consumer iconography.

When this world eventually does undergo its 
World War II
, it is assumed that there will be no effective opposition to 
Nazi Germany
 from its 
Soviet Union
 or 
United Kingdom
 as a result. However, as is disclosed in the novel's sequel, 
Elvissey
, this is an incorrect assumption.

Luther and Jake make the acquaintance of Norman Quarles, an 
African American
 doctor and his wife, Wanda,  but their presence attracts the suspicions of (unseen) 
J. Edgar Hoover
, who sends 
FBI
 agents in pursuit. During the chase, Norman is killed, and Oktobriana contracts Dovlatov's Syndrome, a mutated 
influenza
 virus that emerged in 
Irkutsk
, 
Siberia
 in 1909, and led to the deaths of 
Queen Alexandra
, US House Speaker 
William Dean Howells
, 
Charlie Chaplin
, 
Christy Mathewson
, French Premier 
Clemenceau
, 
Claude Debussy
, 
Guillaume Apollinaire
 and 
Amedeo Modigliani
, amongst others, during the ten year space of this epidemic. Ultimately, Luther and Wanda return to Dryco's future, while Oktobriana and Jake are lost in the interdimensional void. Luther and Wanda spend the rest of their lives together, with a coda that takes place several decades later, just after her death.

As an aside, Luther notes that there are sects described as the  
Albigensian
 Church of Jesus the Light, Reformed and the 
Valentinian
 House of God in this world, which implies the survival of 
gnosticism
 has occurred in this timeline. Amongst the books cited in the

 are the 
Gospel of Matthew

John ""Control"" Rodriguez takes over as the new director of the Southern Reach, a government agency formed to manage a coastal region named Area X. The public is led to believe that the region suffered an 
environmental disaster
 and is isolated for safety; in truth, the region has been taken over by an unknown force changing the environment and ecosystem behind a largely impenetrable ""border."" He is a secret operative assigned by the mysterious Central group which oversees the Southern Reach. He comes from a family of operatives: his mother and grandfather are prominent and influential members. Control reports to a handler called ""The Voice"" at Central over phone calls and e-mail.

In his role as director, Control frequently encounters friction with the existing staff to various degrees: in particular, the assistant director Grace Stevenson, who seems to have an emotional attachment to his predecessor. Control methodically sifts through the accumulated data (interviews, photos, videos) and discovers that there have been many more expeditions into Area X than have been disclosed to the public. The all-male eleventh expedition alone had multiple iterations with slightly different control factors similar to a lab experiment, leading to the formation of an all-female twelfth expedition to see how this composition would interact with Area X. The twelfth expedition's biologist was the protagonist of the 
previous novel
, and the expedition's psychologist was, in fact, the previous director of the Southern Reach (whom he replaced), a fact that she did not reveal to the other members of the expedition.

The biologist mysteriously reappears in a vacant lot and is detained by the Southern Reach for debriefing; Control begins interrogating her. Slowly, he begins to empathize with her and understand her interest in the area's ecosystem. However, she is uncooperative, insisting that she is not the biologist and requesting that Control refers to her as Ghost Bird; after initially failing to gain any information about Area X or what happened there, his tactics become increasingly more unconventional.

Control suspects that he is under hypnosis and (correctly) surmises that his handler, ""The Voice,"" is hypnotizing him to steer his investigation. He is able to throw off the effects of hypnosis and work more independently, but this alienates him from Central, and he relies on his mother to protect him from retaliation. Central forcibly removes Ghost Bird from the Southern Reach, as they believe Control has developed an emotional attachment to her.

Control visits the previous director's house and makes discoveries that hint at a connection to Area X. After returning to Southern Reach headquarters, he has an unsettling interaction with one of the scientists in a hidden room. He tries to go to the science division but finds his path blocked by a wall that should not exist and appears to be alive. As he runs upstairs in terror, he sees that the border of Area X is moving, encroaching on the facility and leading with it a replica of the director. Control is the only member of Southern Reach who reacts to this development with alarm, and he abandons the facility as Area X envelops it. Returning home to pack, he encounters his mother and learns more about what has been happening. Control also realizes the director's identity as the little girl in a photo found at the lighthouse in Area X. This completely alters his outlook, as it is now clear that she is somehow profoundly interlinked with the anomaly.

Control also learns that Ghost Bird has escaped Central. Based on his intuition and knowledge of the biologist's background, Control travels to the site of an old field study she had conducted before she came to the Southern Reach, with Central close behind despite his efforts to dodge their agents. Control finally meets Ghost Bird at a remote location where she has unexpectedly created another portal to Area X at the bottom of a pool of water, a gateway that she believes has formed from a ""brightness"" she carried that has run its course through her. She jumps into the pool, and Control, hearing a voice in his head urging him to follow her, also jumps."

At Martian shipyards on Callisto, a team of soldiers from a radical cell of the OPA steals radar-absorbing stealth coating before destroying the shipyards with an asteroid.

A year later, the 
Rocinante
 is down for long-term maintenance at Tycho station after the events of 
Cibola Burn
. The crew members decide to take care of some personal business during the down time. Amos Burton heads to 
Earth
 when he learns his parent figure there has died, both to pay his formal respects, and to make sure no foul play was involved. Alex Kamal heads to 
Mars
 in the hopes of getting closure with his ex-wife. Naomi Nagata heads to 
Ceres
 station when she receives a message from her former lover Marco Inaros, although she doesn't tell any of her crew-mates why she is leaving.

On Earth, Amos pays respects to his mother figure. Afterwards, Amos goes to visit Clarissa Mao in prison, whom he had grown close to on their journey back from the Slow Zone in 
Abaddon's Gate
.

Jim Holden remains on Tycho and supervises repairs to the 
Rocinante.
 He is approached by documentary producer Monica Stuart to investigate disappearing colony ships headed for the new worlds. Although Stuart is convinced the Protomolecule is responsible, Holden thinks that rogue factions within the OPA are stealing ships and repurposing them. Holden traces one of the disappearing ships to an asteroid cluster near Mars, and forwards the data to Alex to go take a look.

Alex's ex-wife rebuffs his attempts to reconnect, and he instead finds himself working with Bobbie Draper, who takes advantage of his presence to try to investigate missing Martian warships. After they're attacked and nearly killed by an unknown group, they take the 
Razorback
, still in Bobbie's possession after the events of 
Caliban's War
, to investigate the asteroid coordinates Holden sent, where they stumble upon a large fleet of stolen Martian ships.

Meanwhile, on Ceres, it is revealed that Naomi has a son, Filip, with Marco. Naomi spent her youth involved with his radical OPA cell, but left after he tricked her into coding a software override on ship reactors that he used to kill hundreds of Earthers. Marco took Filip from her to attempt to control her, but she managed to escape his cell, and signed on with the 
Canterbury
. Now, years later, Marco's message had claimed that Filip was in trouble to lure Naomi back into his grasp. Marco's forces kidnap Naomi. He explains that he sees the existence of the gates to other solar systems as an existential threat to the Belt, as humanity will not need the Belt's resources with a thousand new planets to exploit. Marco has been stealing Martian ships to take control of the 
Solar System
, creating a fleet he calls the ""Free Navy.""

The Free Navy launches a massive, multi-pronged terror attack across the Solar System. Simultaneously, they launch on attack on Tycho Station (and steal the sole remaining Protomolecule sample), take control of Medina station in the Slow Zone, and attack a convoy transporting the Martian Prime minister. Worst of all, they launch multiple asteroids covered in stealth coating at Earth, devastating the planet and causing an extinction level event. Amos survives the impact event. Working together with Clarissa Mao and former criminal syndicates from his past, he manages to find a ship and escapes the planet.

Alex and Bobby, who had stumbled onto the Free Navy fleet just before they launched their attack, rendezvous with the Martian convoy. Under heavy fire from fake reinforcements that were really Free Navy ships, the Martian prime minister flees on the 
Razorback
 with Alex and Bobby towards Luna.

Meanwhile, Marco reveals his plans to destroy the 
Rocinante
 by sabotaging its reactor, but Naomi manages to send out a broadcast to warn Holden. His plan foiled, Marco instead sends out a ship rigged to explode when the 
Rocinante
 gets close, luring Holden with a fake distress call using Naomi's voice. Naomi fakes her own death, sneaking onto the booby trapped ship instead, and warns the approaching ships of the trap. She is rescued by Alex and Bobbie.

The crew reunites on the 
Rocinante
. What's left of the Earth, Mars and the non-militant OPA government meet on Luna. Naomi finally tells Jim about her violent past. Amos asks that Clarissa stay as his apprentice. The Free Navy, having wreaked devastation on the solar system, retreats past the belt and prevents colonists from going through the rings.

At the book's end, it is revealed that the Free Navy's creation was orchestrated by a rogue faction of the Martian government led by Admiral Winston Duarte with the purpose of trapping Earth and the Belt in a war. Furthermore, it is revealed that some of the disappearing colony ships were not actually stolen by the Free Navy, and are instead being consumed by a force within the gates."

The book alternates between the perspective of the lead character, Cora, and chapters told from a different character's perspective. The featured characters are: Ajarry, Cora's grandmother; Ridgeway, a 
slave catcher
; Stevens, a 
South Carolina
 doctor conducting a social experiment; Ethel, the wife of a 
North Carolina
 station agent; Caesar, a fellow enslaved person who escapes the plantation with Cora; and Mabel, Cora's mother. The chapter locations are: 
Georgia
, South Carolina, North Carolina, 
Tennessee
, 
Indiana
, and (an undefined) ""North"".

Cora is an enslaved person on a plantation in Georgia and an outcast after her mother, Mabel, ran off without her. She resents Mabel for escaping, although it is later revealed that her mother tried to return to Cora but died from a snake bite and never reached her. Caesar approaches Cora about a plan to flee. Reluctant at first, she eventually agrees as her situation with her master and fellow slaves worsens. During their escape, they encounter a group of slave catchers, who capture Cora's young friend Lovey. Cora is forced to kill a twelve-year-old boy to protect herself and Caesar, eliminating any possibility of merciful treatment should she be recaptured. With the help of an inexperienced 
abolitionist
, Cora and Caesar find the Underground Railroad, depicted as a literal underground train system that runs throughout the south, transporting runaways northwards. They take a train to South Carolina.
[

]


Upon learning of their escape, Ridgeway begins a hunt for the pair, mainly in revenge for Mabel, who is the only escapee he has ever failed to capture. Cora and Caesar have taken up comfortable residence in South Carolina under assumed names. South Carolina is enacting a program where the government owns formerly enslaved people but employs them, provides medical treatment, and gives them communal housing. The two enjoy their time there and put off the decision to leave until Cora learns of plans to 
sterilize
 black women and use 
black men as test subjects
 in an experiment to track the spread and degenerative effects of 
syphilis
. Ridgeway arrives before the two can leave, and Cora is forced to return to the Railroad alone. She later learns that Caesar was killed by an angry mob after having been caught and jailed by Ridgeway.

Cora eventually arrives at a closed-down station in North Carolina. She is found by Martin, the son of the station's former operator. North Carolina has recently decided to abolish slavery, using 
indentured servants
 instead, and violently executes any runaway slaves found in the state (as well as some 
freedmen
). Terrified of what the North Carolinians might do to an abolitionist, Martin hides Cora in his attic for several months. Cora becomes ill and is reluctantly treated by Martin's wife, Ethel. While Cora is down from the attic, a raid is conducted on the house, and Ridgeway recaptures her while the mob executes Martin and Ethel.

Ridgeway takes Cora back toward Georgia, detouring through Tennessee to return another enslaved person to his owner. While stopped in Tennessee, Ridgeway's traveling party is attacked by the free-born Royal and two escaped enslaved people, who release Cora. Cora travels to a farm in Indiana owned by a free black man named Valentine, along with Royal. The farm is populated by several freedmen and escapees, living and working in harmony. Royal, an operator on the Railroad, begins a romantic relationship with Cora, although she remains hesitant because of a rape by other slaves in her childhood.

A small faction of freedmen, fearing that the presence of escaped slaves would ruin their peaceful lives, oppose the harboring of non-members of the community. Eventually, the farm is burned, and many people, including Royal, are killed in a raid by white 
Hoosiers
. Various theories are held concerning the source of the attack. Ridgeway recaptures Cora and forces her to take him to a closed-down Railroad station nearby. When they arrive, she pushes him down a flight of stairs, severely injuring him. When last seen, he whispers thoughts on the ""American imperative"" to Homer, who writes them in his journal. Cora then runs off down the tracks. Eventually, she emerges from the underground to find a caravan traveling West. She is given a ride by one of the wagons' black drivers.

Ockham meets with Ganymede, Andō, and European Prime Minister Casimir Perry, to discuss what steps should be taken in the face of recent events. They propose using O.S., the nickname for the Saneer-Weeksbooth's secret system of strategic assassinations which has maintained world peace for almost three centuries.

Carlyle finds herself lured into a meeting with Dominic, her newly reassigned sensayer. The session is interrupted by the arrival of the Utopian Voltaire Seldon, who had tracked the Canner Device to Dominic's room.

In 2144, Jack Chen is a chemist who 
reverse engineers
 patented pharmaceuticals to manufacture 
generic versions
 which she sells on the 
black market
. She lives on a submarine in the 
Arctic Sea
, outside of the Free Trade Zone, an 
economic union
 which covers the majority of North America. Jack steals an experimental drug called Zacuity, a ""productivity enhancer"" which causes the user to experience a pleasurable sensation while working. Jack discovers that the drug has addictive properties intentionally engineered by Zaxy, the corporation that created it. After several hospitalizations and deaths are connected to black market Zacuity, Jack finds herself on the run from legal authorities. She is joined by Threezed, an escaped 
indentured
 human.

Paladin is a newly-activated combat robot owned by the International Property Coalition, or IPC, an international law enforcement organization that handles patent infringement. They
[

 are assigned to handle the Zacuity case alongside Eliasz, a human agent who enjoys the violent aspects of his work. Paladin is indentured to Eliasz and incapable of acting 
autonomously
. While at a shooting range with Paladin, Eliasz becomes aroused. Eliasz berates Paladin using 
homophobic
 slurs after they question him about it, as he perceives Paladin as male and is ashamed by his arousal.

Flashbacks reveal that 30 years ago Jack was in a relationship with Krish Patel, a fellow bioengineer and anti-patent activist, but they had a falling out which led to Jack's turn to piracy. In the present, Jack and Threezed head to Krish's lab in 
Saskatoon
. They pass through 
Yellowknife
, where they meet Med, an autonomous robot who has been independently researching the Zacuity cases. Med joins Jack and Threezed at Krish's lab, where they develop a drug called RetCon intended to be a counteractive to the addictive properties of Zacuity. After publishing RetCon for public use, Med and Threezed find out that it cures Zacuity addiction but people who were addicted for too long become somehow averse to working.

Meanwhile, Eliasz is drugged while undercover at a party in Casablanca, and Eliasz and Paladin have sex. Paladin tells Eliasz that their brain came from a female soldier, and Eliasz begins to refer to Paladin as female. Eliasz travels to Las Vegas and sends Paladin to Vancouver. In order to go undercover in Vancouver's community of autonomous bots, Paladin is given a temporary ""autonomy key"". While autonomous, Paladin examines their own programming and learns that they are programmed to feel a strong sense of attachment to Eliasz.

Eliasz arrives in Vancouver and reconnects with Paladin. Eliasz and Paladin find Krish's lab and confront Krish and Med. Eliasz tortures Krish and kills him after learning Jack's location in 
Moose Jaw
. Jack sets a trap and manages to hold Paladin and Eliasz off long enough for Med and Threezed to arrive. Paladin is gravely wounded in the ensuing fight, and Eliasz has the opportunity to shoot Jack but chooses instead to go back for Paladin.

Jack is officially presumed dead after the firefight. Med publishes her research into Retcon and the drug becomes a widespread treatment for Zacuity addicts. Zaxy conducts a successful PR campaign denying the claims that the black market drug was the same as Zacuity. Paladin recovers from their damage with their autonomy intact but is no longer recognized by the IPC, and Eliasz and Paladin depart together for Mars.

Dana Mills wakes up unsure of what has happened to her or why she is pregnant. She knows she is a member of the 
marines
. She is interrogated and ends up in a mental hospital from which she escapes. She ends up near Herot Hall, a development built on top of the town where she used to live. She hides inside the mountain behind it, which has an abandoned train station and a lake; people think it is haunted. In it she gives birth to her son, Gren.

Despite his mother's instructions, as Gren grows older he wishes to meet the people in Herot and becomes friends with Dylan, a young boy in the town. Willa, Dylan's mother, is introduced. Her mother, Diane, forced her into a marriage with Roger Herot, a plastic surgeon and heir of the Herot development. She acts as the perfect housewife (hiding alcoholism, a likely eating disorder, an unhappy marriage, and copious quantities of stress) and quickly notices something is amiss when Dylan begins to talk about his ""imaginary"" friend Gren. At a disastrous house party Dana appears searching for her son who has run down to play with Dylan. Dylan runs away with Gren as Roger follows them toward the mountain. Roger shoots a bear, thinking it is what took Dylan, but Dana believes that he has shot Gren, and so she murders Roger in retaliation. Following this, police officer Ben Woolf goes searching for Dylan. He finds Dylan, and Dana's severed arm, but he claims he killed Dana and Gren. He is acclaimed as a hero and Willa marries Ben.

Years later, Dylan runs away from the boarding school he has been placed in due to rebellious behaviors to find Gren. Dana, who has been slipping further from reality, argues that the people of Herot are evil – they dug into the mountain and disturbed a graveyard where her mother was buried, turning it into a railway station and creating a museum full of her family's bones and belongings. Gren argues that Dylan was good and finally leaves, going to look for him. They meet and kiss but are found by Ben and, running back to his childhood home, Dylan is brutally stabbed and murdered by Willa. Gren vows for revenge and reconciles with Dana; together they attack Ben at Dylan's funeral. Gren is killed by Ben; everyone realizes he is a boy, not a monster. Dana kills Ben, committing suicide in the process. As Willa is put in handcuffs, she realizes all the people of Herot Hall are monsters."

Jenny Gluckstein, a moody 
Jewish-American
 teenager, lives in 
New York City
 with her divorced mother Sally. Jenny's closest confidante is her cat, Mister Cat. When Sally marries Evan, an Englishman with two sons, the family relocates to 
Dorset
, where Evan has been hired to renovate 300-year-old Stourhead Farm. Due to the extent of the restoration, the family must live in the farm's dilapidated 
manor house
 plagued with unexplained annoyances: erratic electricity and plumbing, strange 
cold spots
 and odors, terrifying howling overhead on stormy nights, and a darkened third-story window that does not correspond to any room in the house. For Jenny, already upset with her mother's remarriage, the move, and the state of the house, the final straw comes when Mister Cat must be 
quarantined
 for six months. Jenny resolves never to accept her step-family or her new home.

After returning from quarantine, Mister Cat's presence attracts a ghostly 
Persian cat
 only he and Jenny can see. Following the cats one night, Jenny locates the mysterious third-story room, where she discovers the ghost of 19-year-old Tamsin Willoughby, daughter of the farm's original owner. Ghosts endure as long as they remember being alive, but Tamsin has blocked out the circumstances surrounding her death, including what became of her sweetheart Edric Davies. Jenny comes to believe something sinister happened the night Tamsin died.

Jenny and Tamsin become close friends, and Tamsin introduces Jenny to the numerous supernatural creatures that occupy the grounds, including the shape-shifting 
Pooka
, while teaching her to avoid more dangerous beings such as the 
redcaps
 who occupy the nearby forest and the all-powerful 
Old Lady of the Elder Tree
, who ruled the land before mankind came. Through her nightly conversations with Tamsin, Jenny learns about 
Judge Jeffreys
, whose 
Bloody Assizes
 terrorized the surrounding area after the 
Monmouth Rebellion
, and who once romantically pursued Tamsin. The Pooka warns that Tamsin's return has also summoned the ghost of Judge Jeffreys, who is still intent on possessing her. Jeffreys' presence makes it difficult for Tamsin to retain her memories, imperiling her existence.

As Jeffreys grows strong enough to impact the living, Jenny continues to research the farm's history and learns that Tamsin and Edric intended to 
elope
 in secret, but that Edric never arrived at the arranged meeting place. Tamsin waited hours in the rain before being discovered by Jeffreys. At Tamsin's bedside when she died of 
pneumonia
, Jeffreys overheard her 
last words
.

With this information, Tamsin is able to remember the night she died: delirious with fever and believing Edric abandoned her, she cursed Edric to wait for her as she had waited in vain for him. Jeffreys used the power of Tamsin's dying words to summon the 
Wild Hunt
 to chase Edric for all eternity, resulting in the screams heard on stormy nights. The cruelty of Tamsin's curse condemned her soul to be trapped at Stourhead. Only Tamsin is capable of undoing the curse and freeing both herself and Edric, but she is slowly succumbing to Jeffreys' more powerful and determined spirit.

On a stormy night when the Hunt is passing overhead, Jeffreys returns to claim a much-weakened Tamsin. With Jenny's encouragement, Tamsin calls down the Hunt and demands they release Edric, but Jeffreys, who still possesses power over the Hunt, sets them on Jenny. Jenny is forced to run for her life before encountering the Old Lady of the Elder Tree, disguised for centuries as cantankerous villager Mrs. Fallowfield, whose 
familiar
 (in the form of an ugly, vicious 
lapdog
) Jenny has rescued from Mister Cat on several previous occasions. Because of this favor, the Lady rescues Jenny and turns the Wild Hunt on Jeffreys. The Lady commands Jenny to forget what she has witnessed, but before departing for the 
afterlife
 with Edric, Tamsin kisses Jenny, allowing her to remember.

Several years later, Jenny has matured from the angry, moody teen she once was and become closer with her step-family, a change she attributes to her friendship with Tamsin. Her research into Tamsin's life and times has given her a deeper appreciation of her new home's history. On the verge of leaving Stourhead to attend the 
University of Cambridge
, Jenny fears she will never experience magic again. The Pooka appears to assure her that she herself has been changed by what she witnessed and that she will always share a connection with the magical world, no matter where she goes.

The Reality Dysfunction
 opens in the year 2581 with a war raging between two worlds, Omuta and Garissa, over three hundred and eighty seven mineral-rich asteroids known as the Dorados. The war escalates in a matter of months and it is rumoured that Garissa has developed an ultimate weapon of mass destruction known only as 'The Alchemist'. The Alchemist deployment mission, on the starship 
Beezling
 and its two escorts, is intercepted by blackhawk mercenaries. Two of the ships survive, although they are crippled and stranded far from the nearest system. Dr. Alkad Mzu, creator of the Alchemist, survives the attack. Shortly after, the Omutans drop fifteen 
antimatter
 planet-busters on Garissa, rendering the planet uninhabitable and killing the majority of the ninety-five million inhabitants. The Confederation imposes a 30-year blockade around Omuta, and executes its government.

Many millions of years earlier, the extremely rare conditions on a moon orbiting a gas giant in a remote galaxy allow for the creation of a lifeform able to 'transcend' to a purely energy-based (later known as energistic) state, the 
Ly-Cilph
. The Ly-cilph become explorers of the universe, determined to know all that can be known about space and time. Over the course of aeons, they explore the universe and, presently, one arrives in the 
Milky Way
 galaxy.

An Edenist voidhawk named 
Iasius
 returns home to Saturn to die. As is traditional, a mating flight is called, with many voidhawks and even a blackhawk, 
Udat
, joining 
Iasius
 on its final voyage into Saturn's atmosphere. As it descends, the other ships energise its bitek eggs, which are taken to nest in Saturn's rings. After several months, when the eggs are large enough, the infant children of 
Iasius'
 captain, Athene, are placed within them, so ship and captain experience infancy together, forming an unbreakable bond of love. The ship that grows from the egg energised by 
Udat
, 
Oenone
, becomes the most notable of the new brood of voidhawks, and its captain, Syrinx, the most wilful. As with many Edenists, Syrinx and 
Oenone
 volunteer to serve a tour of duty with the Confederation Navy, but the destruction of their fellow ship 
Graeae
 (commanded by Syrinx's brother, Thetis) by an Adamist starship (called the 
Dymasio
) using antimatter causes Syrinx to take a dim view of Adamists in general from that point on. She finishes her service with the Navy and then goes into cargo shipping.

A group of colonists arrive on the frontier world of Lalonde from Earth. Grossly overpopulated, with tens, sometimes hundreds of millions of people crammed into domed cities called 
arcologies
, many people on Earth dream of escaping to virgin worlds with open skies above their heads. However, Lalonde is a typical stage-one colony world, dirty and corrupt with a ridiculously low level of technology. The latest colonists, mostly from Earth's European arcologies, vow to create a peaceful, safe society. They are taken by steamboat up the mighty Juliffe River to found their new township, which they name Aberdale. Among the colonists are the Skibbow family, whose patriarch, Gerald, is excited about the prospect of living as a farmer. His teenage daughter, Marie, is less impressed and vows to escape back to Earth at the first opportunity. Also among the colonists are Father Horst Elwes, a Christian priest, and a large number of 'Ivets' (Involuntary Transportees), petty criminals from Earth sentenced to work on the colony worlds to repay their debt to society. Unbeknown to the authorities, one of the Ivets, Quinn Dexter, is a member of the Light Brother sect (devil worshippers) and is armed with highly advanced information implants which have escaped detection. Dexter soon exerts his command over all the other Ivets through the use of satanic rituals, whilst simultaneously ingratiating himself with the colonists. His act does not fool Powel Manani, the town's assigned settlement supervisor. Around this time the Ly-cilph arrives on Lalonde and studies Aberdale. Its curiosity is piqued when Father Elwes manages to see it, since few species are capable of perceiving it.

Joshua Calvert is a resident of Tranquillity, an independent bitek habitat (one of only five such habitats) orbiting the gas giant Mirchusko. Tranquillity was founded to study the Ruin Ring, the remains of some forty thousand alien habitats which apparently self-destructed two thousand years ago. It was created by the strictly Christian Kulu Kingdom, but when its founder Prince Michael Saldana chose to also accept affinity gene implants and have them inherited by his children, Tranquillity was excommunicated by the Kingdom and its leaders disinherited. Since then it has flourished as a tax haven, a trustworthy base for blackhawk mating flights, and an exclusive business locale in its area of the Confederation. Calvert has inherited a trader starship, the 
Lady MacBeth
, from his late father, but the ship was heavily damaged in an unknown incident (Calvert makes up several stories during the course of the novel to explain this incident, all false; the incident is later explained in the short story 'Escape Route' in the short story collection 
A Second Chance at Eden
) and is no longer operational. Calvert dreams of making a big find in the Ruin Ring to finance repairs. Much to his surprise, Calvert indeed strikes lucky, finding a virtually intact memory core with the first-ever images of the reason for the Laymil racial suicide. However, decoding the information will take some time. Calvert sells his find for nearly seven million six hundred thousand fuseodollars, fixes up the 
Lady MacBeth
 and begins his life as a trader captain. He also starts a relationship with Ione Saldana, the current ruler of Tranquillity.

Also on Tranquillity is Dr. Alkad Mzu, who has been imprisoned on the habitat for nearly thirty years. How she escaped the situation at the start of the novel is not explained. Mzu is kept under the watchful eye of half a dozen major Confederation intelligence agencies to ensure that her knowledge of the Alchemist is not revealed to anyone else. From time to time, Mzu asks ship captains for passage off the habitat, knowing that such requests will be vetoed by Ione Saldana. She asks both Calvert and Meyer, the captain of the 
Udat
, for aid but both times they refuse to help after Saldana intervenes.

On Lalonde Dexter encounters a group of people hiding in the jungle, led by the authoritative Laton. Laton is a 'Serpent', an Edenist who has rejected his society and, for lack of a better term, 'gone bad'. More than thirty-five years ago Laton tried to stage a coup to seize control of a habitat called Jantrit, using a proteinic virus to threaten it with destruction. In the resulting chaos the habitat was destroyed (the only Edenist habitat ever lost) with more than a million deaths. The Confederation Navy believed it had killed Laton, but Laton had evaded capture and fled into obscurity in the wilds of Lalonde. Laton, impressed with Dexter's resourcefulness (but disgusted by his religion), offers him a place in his organisation, whose goal is the discovery of true immortality. Dexter pretends to agree, knowing refusal will mean death. Realising that Dexter is faking his interest, Laton arranges for the villagers to discover that the Ivets are satanists. In the resulting chaos most of Dexter's followers are killed. The remaining few take Powel Manani prisoner and sacrifice him in a grisly ceremony. At this moment, the observing Ly-cilph detects a strange energy current streaming from Manani through a quantum fracture in the space-time continuum. The Ly-cilph attempts to investigate by following the energy current, only to find it flooding into an energistic vacuum. Unable to extricate itself, the Ly-cilph goes into hibernation whilst still halfway between the two dimensions. This allows the strange energy forms in the dimension beyond to cross back into our universe.

The result is utter mayhem. Several of the strange entities seize control of Dexter and his followers, in effect 'possessing' them. Able to call upon powers from the other realm, such as the ability to control and alter matter and hurl powerful white fireballs around, they then seize control of Aberdale and Laton's compound, forcing the inhabitants to accept possession or death. Father Elwes escapes onto the savannah with most of Aberdale's children, but not before one of the possessed reveals a terrible secret: the possessing entities are the souls of humans who have died and been trapped, some of them for millennia, in an absolute void where the only way to pass the time is to parasitically feed on the memories and experiences of others. And there are billions of them in the darkness still screaming for escape.

At the moment Laton is possessed, he manages to generate a tremendously powerful affinity SOS. This reaches the only two Edenists on the planet, a pair of agents from the Edenist Intelligence agency. They travel upriver to investigate, but are neutralised by the possessed. They manage to alert Ralph Hiltch (the Kulu External Security Agency's Lalonde head of station) and Kelven Solanki (from Confederation Navy Intelligence) to the threat, although not its nature. With the subversion spreading across the planet, the governor authorises the recruitment of mercenaries to put down what he perceives as an 'Ivet uprising'. Unbeknown to the governor, several possessed have already infiltrated the capital, Durringham, and taken passage on ships bound for other worlds.

One of these ships is the 
Lady MacBeth
. Calvert has hit on the idea of transporting Lalonde's legendarily tough wood (called Mayope) to the pastoral planet of Norfolk, which has banned all high technology. The idea sounds crazy, but it gets around Norfolk's ban on high-tech items and gives Calvert access to the planet's lucrative market in 'Norfolk Tears', the most desired alcoholic beverage in the galaxy. Calvert also begins a relationship with Louise Kavanagh, the young and naive daughter of Joshua's business partner, Grant. Although Calvert treats the relationship as a bit of fun, Louise falls in love with Joshua and, due to her planet's lack of chemical contraceptive, falls pregnant shortly after he leaves. Unfortunately for Norfolk, Calvert's passenger on the flight from Lalonde was a man called Quinn Dexter.

Syrinx and 
Oenone
 arrive at Atlantis, the only planet colonised by Edenists (and unsurprisingly, entirely covered in a vast planet-ranging ocean), to purchase seafood to transport to Norfolk to trade for their Tears. During the stay at Pernik Island, Syrinx develops a relationship with an Edenist by the name of Mosul, the son of the family patriarch and guardian of the family fishing business. Mosul and Syrinx develop a contract which includes Syrinx's return to distribute ten percent of Syrinx's stock to the inhabitants of Pernik Island. However, the possessed have infiltrated Atlantis, led by the possessed Laton. They have taken control of Pernik Island and plan to possess Syrinx in the hope of possessing 
Oenone
 as well. Syrinx is captured and tortured as a prelude to possession. The plot backfires when Laton, having taken the time to study his possessing soul, manages to gain access to Pernik Island. He saves Syrinx, allows the crew of 
Oenone
 to rescue her (and gives them a message to take to Jupiter), and then causes the island to self-destruct, killing all of the possessed on it.

Laton's departure from Lalonde was observed by a reporter. Within days half the Confederation knows that the most infamous Serpent of them all has returned, and a Confederation-wide quarantine to prevent the spread of Laton and his proteanic virus is enacted.

On Tranquillity data from the Laymil information stack reveals that their homeworld in the Mirchusko system (which does not seem to exist any more) was taken over by a 'reality dysfunction', triggered by the 'Galheith research death essence tragedy'. The data shows the Laymil homeworld being overrun by a red cloud of unknown origin.

On Lalonde the possessed close to within a few hundred kilometres of Durringham. As they advance, a strange red cloud starts forming above centres of possessed activity. Ralph Hiltch and Kelven Solanki evacuate their respective personnel from the planet. Hiltch's team manage to capture a possessed before they leave (this possessed is controlling the body of Gerald Skibbow of Aberdale) Solanki's report reaches the Confederation Navy, which swiftly organises a fleet to quarantine Lalonde.

On Norfolk Quinn Dexter manages to reassert control of his body, by feeding his possessor images of his depraved activities as a satanist to the point where the possessor starts behaving like Dexter and then retreats into a catatonic state. Enhanced with his ex-possessor's energistic power, Dexter swiftly organises the possessed and they rapidly start taking over the planet.

Several more possessed reach the independent bitek habitat Valisk in the Srinagar system and begin possessing several inhabitants as a prelude to taking over the entire habitat. They are led by Kiera, who has possessed the body of Marie Skibbow from Aberdale. Dariat, one of the children of Rubra, the eccentric genius who founded Valisk and then transferred his personality into it upon his death, becomes aware of their activities and volunteers to help them, so he can revenge himself upon the manipulative Rubra. His knowledge of the habitat's surveillance techniques and how to evade them proves invaluable to the possessed. They kill him, and then guide his soul into a new body to give him the same powers they possess.

The Kulu embassy staff reach Ombey, the nearest Kulu colony world to Lalonde. However, when they bring their possessed prisoner out of zero-tau (a form of suspension which reduces energy movements to zero, effectively freezing time), they find the possessing spirit has fled, leaving the traumatised, broken form of Gerald Skibbow within. Princess Kirsten Saldana, the Saldana family member responsible for Ombey, is rapidly forced to declare a state of emergency when it is revealed that three personnel from the embassy staff were possessed and have begun spreading across the planet. Ralph Hiltch is brought in to advise.

The 
Lady MacBeth
 reaches Tranquillity at the same time that representatives of the Lalonde government are forming a mercenary fleet and army to save the planet. Keen to protect his investment, Calvert volunteers to accompany the fleet. They reach Lalonde (of which a sizable portion is covered by a strange red cloud) and begin landing mercenaries on the surface, but many of the landing teams are rapidly possessed and return to the orbiting ships. A full-scale space battle erupts when the Confederation Navy squadron arrives to blockade the planet and the possessed ships start firing on them. The mercenary team from the 
Lady MacBeth
 evades possession and manage to take a prisoner whose possessor is called Shaun Wallace, who tells them that the red cloud will hide Lalonde from the universe. He reveals that the possessed can hear the cries for help from the entities still in 'the beyond' and they desperately need to escape them. Once the cloud encircles Lalonde completely, the combined will of the possessed can physically move the planet onto another plane of existence where the cries of the dead souls will not reach them.

The mercenary team evacuates to a nearby settlement belonging to the alien Tyrathca. The xenocs are extremely agitated by the human's newly revealed ability to become 'elemental' as they call it. They have built a statue to their 'Sleeping God', which 'sees the universe' and they believe will save them. A reporter accompanying the mission, Kelly Tirrel, takes images of the statue and notes that there is no record of the Tyrathca having a god due to their highly unimaginative nature. They move on and discover Father Elwes and the children from Aberdale in hiding on the savannah. They manage to arrange a pick-up from the 
Lady MacBeth
. The mercenary team sacrifices itself against an attack by possessed masquerading as the stereotypical knights in shining armour in order to give the children, Elwes and Kelly, time to evacuate.

A message hidden in the request for aid given by Alkad Mzu to Captain Meyer of the 
Udat
 is revealed, offering him a vast sum of money for his help in aiding her escape. Meyer agrees and has 
Udat
 make a wormhole jump into the 
interior
 of Tranquillity. Mzu arranges to be in place for a pick-up, but underestimates the ability and sheer power of Tranquillity to enforce its will through affinity. 
Udat
 is compelled to jump back out with Mzu perilously hanging onto a rope ladder trailing from the blackhawk.

Renegade

 Vergil Ulam creates simple biological computers based on his own 
lymphocytes
. Faced with orders from his nervous employer to destroy his work, he injects them into his own body, intending to smuggle the ""noocytes""
[1]
 (as he calls them) out of the company and work on them elsewhere. Inside Ulam's body, the noocytes multiply and evolve rapidly, altering their own genetic material and quickly becoming self-aware.

The nanoscale civilization they construct soon begins to transform Ulam, then others. The people who are infected start to find that genetic faults such as 
myopia
 and 
high blood pressure
 are fixed. Ulam's eyesight, posture, strength, and intelligence are all improved. The infected can even have conversations with their noocytes, with some reporting that the cells seem to sing.

Through infection, 
conversion
, and 
assimilation
 of humans and other organisms, the cells eventually aggregate most of the 
biosphere
 of North America into a region 7,000 km (4,300 mi) wide. This civilization, which incorporates both the evolved noocytes and recently assimilated conventional humans, is eventually forced to abandon the normal plane of existence in favor of one in which thought does not require a physical substrate. The reason for the noocytes' inability to remain in this reality is somewhat related to the strong 
anthropic principle

The novel's protagonist, Aiah, is a minor functionary for the Plasm Authority in the metropolis of Jaspeer; the Authority is the public utility company that taps plasm wells and sells the plasm (at very high rates) to those who would use it. Aiah is one of the Barkazi, an ethnic group whose metropolis, Barkazil, was engulfed by civil war several generations ago, its territory partitioned and occupied by the adjacent metropolises and its population dispersed as refugees. Barkazi religion centers around a 
trickster
 god, Karlo, who is constantly running 
scams
 on others, and the tradition of the scam, or 
chonah,
 is central to their culture. Aiah briefly studied plasm use at university, but ended her studies because of the high cost of the plasm required to continue them.

Working for an emergency response team investigating a huge flaming apparition of a woman that damages several city blocks, she discovers a previously unknown plasm well of tremendous power (the apparition being caused by a woman who blundered into the well and tapped the plasm directly, killing herself in the process). Instead of disclosing its location, she leads the Authority on a wild goose chase while trying to decide on how best to use it to her advantage.

She decides to reveal it to Constantine, a resident of a luxury apartment complex near her own. Constantine is a skilled mage and visionary political theorist with dreams of moving the world beyond its stagnant situation. He became Metropolitan of his home metropolis and attempted to implement many reforms, but was betrayed, forced from power, and exiled by those closest to him. Aiah, an admirer of his political thought, discloses the plasm source to him so that he might make another attempt at realizing his plans for the ""New City"", asking only that she be made a part of whatever he carries out.

Aiah then effectively runs a 
chonah
 of enormous scale, misleading the Authority, dealing with her Barkazi extended family (who want a piece of whatever action she is in on) and the local organized crime group, keeping her Jaspeeri boyfriend (working in a distant metropolis) in the dark, and avoiding the potentially lethal attentions of Constantine's right-hand-woman, Sorya. Through all of this she has a love affair with Constantine and receives training in magery from him, for which she has a great deal of natural talent.

At the novel's climax, Aiah's plasm source, and her own magical assistance, is a crucial element when Constantine orchestrates a revolution in the metropolis of Caraqui and installs himself in its post-revolutionary power structure, from which position he hopes to enact his New City reforms. Realizing that she has no hope of using her full potential as a bureaucrat in Jaspeer, Aiah leaves her job, family, and relationship behind and travels to Caraqui to help Constantine achieve his dream."

The novel tells the story of two characters, Rue Cassels and Michael Bequith, and their encounter with an alien spacecraft Rue has named 
Jentry's Envy.
  Schroeder uses the story as a venue for discussing the information economy and philosophy.

Rue, on the run from her brother Jentry and out of money, files claim on an undiscovered comet. She expects to profit from the 
mineral rights
, but it turns out that the ""comet"" is actually an 
interstellar cycler
, a ship that travels in a 
light-years
 length orbit, at 
relativistic speeds
 (85% c) carrying cargo and passengers between the Halo Worlds, planets that orbit 
brown dwarf
 stars. The discovery causes a sensation, since the ship is the first to approach the planet Erythrion in ten years. Eventually her claim is upheld, since the cycler is silent, and her mineral rights become salvage rights, making her potentially very wealthy. A rich cousin of hers, Max Cassels, sponsors an expedition to the ship so she can claim it. Intrigue happens on the trip as several factions also want to claim it, such as the planetary government. The cyclers were the centerpiece of the Cycler Compact, but have slowly fallen out of use since the discovery of 
FTL
 travel, only possible between ""lit"" worlds. When they reach the ship, they are surprised to discover that it is an alien cycler, an unknown because all known aliens use FTL ships. They explore the ship some and jump off as it passes a lit world, Chandaka.

Michael Bequith, a NeoShinto monk and aide to Dr. Laurent Herat, an 
exobiologist
, are commandeered by Rear Admiral Crisler of the Rights Economy to join a joint expedition back to the 
Envy
. The RE is interested, because the 
Envy
 appears to be a multi-species vessel, something previously unheard of. They are also interested because writing on the craft is the script of an alien species, the Lasa, who have supposedly been extinct for the last two billion years. Rue and her crew are also returning, since under Compact law she can only complete her claim if she can control the 
Envy
.

Before they can leave, the city suffers a rebel attack and one of their party, Dr Linda Ophir, is murdered. They travel in a 
ramscoop
 ship, the 
Banshee
.

When they arrive, they explore various areas of the ship before an explosion damages life support on the 
Banshee
. Michael discovers that Dr. Ophir was murdered because she had discovered pictures of the writing on the 
Envy
 had been tampered with. Eventually they discover that part of the 
Envy
 is designed as a test to ascertain living conditions for visitors. Rue completes the process and the cycler builds them a new module and a set of controls.

The expedition leaves the 
Envy
 for Oculus, a Halo world. Rue, now a Cycler Captain by law, is caught up in Compact politics over the course of the 
Envy
. Michael and Dr. Herat arrange with representative of the alien Autotrophs to translate the writing on the 
Envy
. The translation has grave consequences since it implies that the weapon of the Chicxulub, an ancient race that sent out waves of 
self-replicating machines
 to wipe out potential competitors, has survived. They realize that Crisler wants to use the weapon to wipe out the rebels.

Rue learns from Max that Mallory, a Halo Worlder, wants to dissolve the Compact and join the RE. Rue goes to meet her crew to prepare to leave, but they are ambushed by Crisler and Max is killed. Rue, Michael, Dr Herat and Barents (a Rebel) escape in a submarine, but the attackers destroy the control computer just as they dive. They continue to do so for some hours, eventually getting caught by a 
cold current
. They wind up at a secret undersea research base, where they are rescued by 
military police
.

They learn that Rue was believed dead along with her cousin and Crisler and Mallory have already departed for the 
Envy
, having learned its point of origin, Apophis and Osiris, planetless binary brown dwarfs. They expect that he will arrive in sixteen months. The government has a secret way that will get them there, but only for citizens of the Compact.

Dr. Herat elects to become a citizen of the compact, but Michael abstains. Michael passes preparation time for the trip by exploring abandoned ice tunnels on the planet with Barents. They discover that the Autotroph plans to leave the planet and warn its race about the weapon. Michael convinces them to let humans handle it. A message from a loyal member of the 
Envy
'
s crew arrives, stating that Crisler is planning a dangerous maneuver that will cut three months off his travel time. Rue takes drastic measures and 
shanghais
 Michael on the voyage, a new technology that allows a fleet of 15 small 
interceptor
 ships to enter FTL from inside the atmosphere of a brown dwarf.

They arrive safely at the Twins (except for one ship) and discover that the Twins are ringed with power tethers that allow resources and power to be extracted. In the 
orbital center
 of the system is the 
construction shack
 that created the 
Envy
. Her fleet is briefly attacked by the system's defenses, but she learns how to camouflage her ships. The 
Banshee
 was less successful and suffered a major 
hull breach
.

Rue and the soldiers sneak into the 
Banshee
 and free some of her original crew. The rest are in the construction shack, being used as explorers by Crisler. They leave for the construction shack, stealing an antimatter generator to use as cover. They enter the shack by way of burning a hole in the hull. Inside, Michael's team and Crisler's men are engaged in a 
firefight
 (literally, as the inside atmosphere is a hydrogen/oxygen mix). Michael shoots out a magnet block controlling the airlock and Crisler's marines are sucked out into space.

However, Crisler soon recaptures them. He reveals that the shack is not the true treasure, but the cycler mother seeds, one of which can regrow a complete cycler construction system. He plans to 
reverse engineer
 the technology and use it to wipe out the rebels and their worlds. Since the ships would be unable to distinguish between Rebel and alien worlds, this would amount to genocide on a universal scale. They also discover that the shack was not built by Lasa, but renegade Chicxulub, who embraced the Lasa philosophy.

Crisler's new cycler finishes and the shack launches it. Rue and company escape from Crisler by cutting loose a habitat. Barendts leaves with the seed and Michael pursues him. Rue leaves the habitat to get one of the interceptors and meets Michael, returning with the seed.

Later, Rue and her crew watch as Crisler's cycler is launched from the system. The power tethers have redirected power back into one of the dwarfs to create a massive flare to use as an energy beam.

On Erythrion, Rue announces her plan to revitalize the Cycler Compact, since the Lasa/Chicxulub technology means that the Halo worlds will at last be able to launch their own cyclers.

Rue, however, is already planning her voyage to New Armstrong to reclaim the 
Envy
 and capture Crisler and Mallory."

Millennium
 features a civilization that has dubbed itself ""The Last Age"". Due to millennia of warfare of every type (nineteen nuclear wars alone), the Earth has been heavily polluted and humanity's gene pool irreparably damaged. They have thus embarked on a desperate plan; 
time travel
 into the past, collect healthy humans, and send them to an uncontaminated planet to rebuild civilization.

The time travelers can only take people that will have no further effect on the timeline: those who have vanished without a trace, or died without being observed; otherwise they would be changing the past, which risks a 
temporal paradox
 and perhaps even a catastrophic breakdown of the fabric of time. Though they collect everyone they can, they exert a great deal of effort on those destined to die in various disasters such as sinking ships and crashing airplanes (and once a 
century
 of Roman soldiers lost and dying in the North African desert). As such incidents leave no survivors to report interference and change the timeline, they can freely remove the living but soon-to-die victims, and replace them with convincing corpses they have manufactured in the future.

The novel deals with several of the raids, their eventual discovery in the present day, and the fallout that results from changes to the present day reverberating into the future.

The story follows Louise Baltimore, who is in charge of a ""snatch team"" that goes back into the past to kidnap people who would otherwise die.  Because of the massive pollution and the genetic damage she has sustained, she is missing one leg and must get advanced medical treatment daily.  Her natural appearance is quite ugly due to skin damage (from ""paraleprosy"") and other problems; however, she wears a special ""skin suit"" which makes her look whole and beautiful (which may or may not be real—she is an 
unreliable narrator
), and gives her a functional artificial leg.

The team she leads uses a ""time gate"" to appear in the bathroom aboard an airplane in flight.  Dressed to look like flight attendants, they begin to bluff the passengers into entering the bathroom where they are pushed into the gate, to arrive in the future. After large numbers of people disappear, the remaining passengers become suspicious. The future team then uses special weapons to stun them before throwing them through the gate.

During the removal of the passengers, they run into an unexpected 
hijacker
. The ensuing gunplay is one-sided; one of the snatch team members is killed, and her stunner is lost. The rest of the team finishes removing the passengers and the real flight attendants. The team then scatters pre-burnt body parts around the plane so they will be found after the crash. As the plane approaches the moment when it is destined to crash, the lost weapon still has not been found.

Upon returning to her present (our future), Louise is informed that the weapon that was left behind has caused a paradox and that it must be recovered to prevent a breakdown in the fabric of time."

In the scene that follows, we suddenly find Sparrow waking in a confusing place with new injuries and no memory of the preceding 36 hours.  On the way to enlightenment we meet many of Sparrow's friends and experience the Night Market, a large section of the city only open during darkness, ruled by ""The Deal"": everything is transactional. After a cryptic Tarot reading from friend Sherrea, abduction by a dead man animated by what might as well be a Loa, and introduction to a Vodun-based community that is dedicated to replacing, by coup if necessary, the status quo in the city.

Map of 
Earthsea
 


Alder, a minor village sorcerer who is adept at mending, has been tormented by dreams since the death of his beloved wife Lily. Every time he falls asleep, he is brought to the wall of stones, the border between the world of the living and the Dry Land of the dead. The dead, including Lily, beseech him to be set free. He sought guidance from the masters of the school of wizardry on Roke island. The Master Patterner advises him to seek out Ged on the island of Gont. 
Ged
, the ex-Archmage, is powerless as a wizard, but knows more of the world of the dead than anyone living. Alder finds Ged, who is alone at the time, as his Kargish wife Tenar and adopted daughter Tehanu have been summoned to Havnor to counsel King Lebannen. Ged listens to Alder's tale and recommends he go to Havnor to speak to both the king and his family.

Alder sails to the big island of Havnor and tells his story to the already assembled council. Lebannen is concerned, but has other worries. The king of the Kargs, a warlike people from the East who despise sorcery, has sent his daughter to marry Lebannen as the price for peace between them, a demand that angers Lebannen. Furthermore, dragons have been menacing the islands in the archipelago closest to their territory on the western-most islands. Soon after Alder arrives, dragons encroach further into the archipelago than ever before, finally to Havnor itself. The king and his people ride to negotiate with them. Tehanu goes with him because she appears to have some kinship with dragons, having as a young girl summoned the great dragon 
Kalessin
, who called her ‘daughter’, but is now departed, “flying on the other wind”. She speaks to one of the raiding dragons who delivers a cryptic message, to the effect that the dragons are angry that men have stolen part of their lands in the furthest west. The dragons do, however, agree to a truce, and to send an emissary.

The dragon Orm Irian arrives shortly after, taking human form of a young woman to address the king and his council. The legends of the dragons, the mages, and the Kargs are retold and compared. It is revealed that dragons and men were once one people, but parted ways: Dragons chose a life of freedom and immortality in the Furthest West, while men chose a life of mastery, power, and rebirth, promising to give up magic. However, men reneged on their bargain, and the first mages cast spells that stole some of the beautiful Western Lands from the dragons, for men to go to after death. But in their attempt to create an eternal life, the old mages had instead created the Dry Land, a grim, unchanging, desolate place where their souls languished forever. The party decide to sail to Roke, the center of the world, to seek a resolution.

The King's party debates with the masters of the great school of magic on what course of action to take. The two groups travel together magically to the Dry Lands to the Wall of Stones, which the dead are vainly attempting to tear down. Alder begins to dislodge a stone, each stone in the wall as seen in the Dry Lands being one of the spells used to carve it out of the dragons' Western Lands. Alder is joined by Tehanu, then the others, each using magic to unmake the wall. Once the wall is sufficiently breached, the imprisoned dead rush free to return to the cycle of life, death, and rebirth, and Alder is reunited with his wife Lily and dies. The dragon Kalessin arrives and completes the demolition, and the Dry Land returns to its beauty and is rejoined with the dragons' Western Lands. Tehanu is finally able to transform into an uncrippled dragon.

After the balance of the world is restored, the king marries the Kargish princess, whom he has come to love and admire, and Tenar returns to Gont and to Ged."

The book's 
frame narrative
 and premise is that ""after dabbling in radical politics"", 
Adolf Hitler
 emigrated to the United States in 1919 and became a science fiction illustrator, editor, and author. He wrote his final 
science fantasy
 novel 
Lord of the Swastika
 in six weeks in 1953, shortly before dying of 
cerebral hemorrhage
[
1
]
 (possibly caused by tertiary 
syphilis
); 
Lord of the Swastika
 subsequently wins the 
Hugo Award
 and the ""colorful uniforms"" described therein become regularly worn by fans at 
science fiction conventions
. Hitler's other published works include the long-running 
fanzine
 
Storm
 and the novels 
The Master Race
, 
The Thousand Year Rule
, and 
The Triumph of the Will
.

In a faux review following the main narrative, presented as written by (fictitious) Dr. Homer Whipple of 
New York University
, we learn more about the background of the alternate history in which Hitler emigrated to the United States. Without Hitler's leadership, the 
Nazi Party
 fell apart in 1923 and the 
Communist Party of Germany
 succeeded in fomenting a German communist revolution in 1930. As this alternate history continues, there is reference to a ""Greater 
Soviet Union
"" which took over the United Kingdom in 1948, and whose influence is growing in Latin America by 1959. Whipple refers to 
World War I
 as ""the Great War"", implying that there has been no equivalent of 
World War II
 in this world. The core element in the historical backstory of 
Lord of the Swastika
 is a 
nuclear apocalypse
 but Whipple gives no indication about such weapons really existing in this alternate reality.

Whipple also discloses that the 
Empire of Japan
 has retained 
its militarism
, with reference to its 
bushido
 code of conduct, while the United States vacillates against the Greater Soviet Union's ascendancy. Due to the Greater Soviet Union threat, the United States and Japan have a close military and strategic alliance. Japanese militarist values are much admired in the United States. Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (collectively called the Pacific Pact) are the only major powers standing between the Greater Soviet Union and total control of the globe—yet most Americans seem unable to be roused to deal with the looming Soviet danger. Whipple wonders what the emergence of an American leader like Feric Jaggar, the hero of 
Lord of the Swastika
, could accomplish. Finally, there is a casual mention that, while in this history Nazi Germany never came into being, it is the Soviets who have undertaken a systematic genocide of the Jews of Europe in this world's version of the 
Holocaust
.

Lord of the Swastika
 is lauded for its qualities as a great work of 
heroic fantasy
. To further hammer the point, in an early edition, actual science fiction writers wrote fictional statements of praise for ""Hitler's"" writing skills for Spinrad to use as blurbs on the novel's back cover. Irony abounds in Whipple's review, as he argues author Hitler is obviously wrong in assuming that not much more than midnight rallies and 
phallic symbolism
 would create a large number of supporters for a movement.

Lord of the Swastika
 opens in the year 1142 A.F.—""After Fire"", the global 
nuclear war
 referred to as the ""Time of Fire"" which brought about the end of the civilization of the technologically advanced ""Ancients"" and the current despoliation of most forms of life. The 
gene pools
 of almost all life forms are corrupted by the

. Few examples of the baseline human form can be seen, and most of humanity are mutants with blue skins, lizard scales or parrot beaks, or wizened half-breed mutants and normal-seeming but inhuman ""Dominators"", who desire to rule the ruined world with their mind-controlling powers.

The pure and strong young ""Trueman"" (so named for the lack of mutations in his 
DNA
) Feric Jaggar returns from the outlands of Borgravia where his family was exiled by the treaty of Karmak with the surrounding mutant states to his ancestral land, the High Republic of Heldon, which was founded on the principles of killing mutants and keeping humanity pure. He arrives only to find its rigor slackened and corrupted by the ""Universalists"", pawns of the sinister Dominator country Zind, which seeks to corrupt Heldon's pure human gene pool into the mutant diversity that rules the rest of the world. Indeed, in the very first portion of Heldon that Feric enters, the customs fort where entrants are tested to see whether they are pure and free of mutation, he is outraged that mutants are being allowed into Heldon on day-passes, that the fort is under the spell of a Dominator, and that the tests are so lax that impure specimens are being granted citizenship.

Eagle's Nest
"" tavern, and mulls over the question of how to change this situation. Should he enter politics or the military? Feric witnesses the oratory of Seph Bogel, leader of the Human Renaissance Party, who speaks eloquently but ineffectually to the crowd about the need for human purity. Fired by his words, Feric is inspired to take control of the listening crowd and leads a mob to the same border post, there to slay the Dominator (or ""Dom"") who had quietly disguised himself as a clerk to sway the immigration decisions in favor of mutants. At Bogel's invitation, he assumes leadership of the Party, which Feric later renames The Sons of the Swastika, and the two travel on to Walder—the second city of Heldon—to meet the party inner circle and begin the great task.

Their journey is interrupted when their steam-powered vessel is waylaid by the outlaw petrol-powered 
motorcycle gang
, the Black Avengers. Jaggar, however, senses that these men may be of use to his cause and challenges their leader, Stag Stopa. The rules of the Black Avengers only allow a member to challenge the leader, and so he and Bogel are taken back to their headquarters for Feric to be initiated. Feric acquits himself mainly in the drinking of 
ale
 and in running the gauntlet of torches on a motorcycle. He and Stopa duel with truncheons, and Feric's truncheon breaks. Desperately he reaches out and picks up the ""Great Truncheon of Stag Held"" lying nearby—which can only be wielded by a descendant of the last true King of Heldon, Sigmark IV. The Black Avengers immediately pledge fealty to him, and become the ""Knights of the Swastika"".

From this event, Jaggar assumes a hereditary right to be the leader of Heldon and embarks on a violent crusade for genetic purity, drawing a massive following, staging outdoor rallies and raising an army personally loyal to him. He is elected to the Council and stages a coup d'état when he forces the Council to admit to treason and a Zind plot against Heldon. Confirming his suspicions, the Universalist member of the Council turns out to be a Dom. Feric summarily executes him with the Great Truncheon. Jaggar coerces the Council into granting him complete executive power and then has them shot. Immediately after assuming power Jaggar 
puts down an imminent coup by Stopa
, who has been corrupted by the fleshly pleasures of Zind.

Backed by the army and the adoring multitudes, Feric sets about the great task of re-invigorating the military, ordering the production of tanks and fighter jets, the establishment of the Swastika Squad (
SS
)—a legion of the purest and most manly men that can be found via the ""Classification Camps"", which examine all citizens of Heldon (killing the Doms and sterilizing or exiling all relatively impure humans). After repelling a Zind attack through Wolack, Heldon 
annexes its western and southern neighbors
, beginning with Borgravia. In the course of the Helderisation of its neighbors Jaggar orders, at the suggestion of Bors Remler, that all mutants are to be euthanised rather than exiled.

Months later, his scientists report that they are near to rediscovering the secrets of atomic bombs, but that Zind is making efforts to dig up relics of the Ancients, which might salvage its own complement of nuclear weaponry. Noting the damage such weapons had done, Feric orders such research ended, and determines to wipe out Zind and every last Dom before they can unleash the Fire.  Soon enough, Zind begins to rally its troops from their reverse in Wolack. The final invasion of Zind is hard fought: the main Helder force, under the command of Lar Waffing, takes the southwestern oil fields needed for resupply, while the secondary force fights a delaying action against the vast bulk of the Zind army to the north towards the Zind capital, Bora. Needless to say, the forces of Heldon prevail and the Zind army is destroyed and burned, down to the last mindless ""Warrior"". The central city is reduced to a cinder in a firestorm (akin to the 
bombing of Dresden
 in our world).

The last Dom, apparently a leader and with immense mental powers, is discovered hiding in a command bunker. The Dom has anticipated military defeat and, before Feric has the pleasure of killing him, triumphantly reveals that the Doms had salvaged and rearmed one of the ancient nuclear weapons. It is a 
doomsday weapon
, and he triggers the failsafe. After Feric and his cohorts have evacuated Bora, a 
cobalt bomb
 detonates, and as the Dom planned, its fallout utterly corrupts the gene pool of Heldon. If any of its citizens, including Feric, reproduce, they will produce the mutants that they had previously sought to obliterate.

Feric orders the sterilization of the entire Heldon nation, including himself, and, in a final desperate gamble, orders the SS scientists to redouble their efforts to develop the next 
Master Race
 from 
cloning
 the perfect specimens of the SS. Eventually they succeed and millions of the new master race are produced in 'reproduction works' to complete the cleansing of the Earth. At the novel's close, Heldon has mastered 
interstellar travel
. As a consequence, an initial starship, full of 300 of these seven-foot, blond, super-intelligent all-male SS clones in 
suspended animation
, is launched into space to initiate Heldon's own 
galactic empire
. The SS clones also have a clone of Feric to lead them. This inaugural rocket is launched on a voyage to 
Tau Ceti
 and will become the first of many.

""Indeed, in the book Hitler seems to assume that masses of men in fetishistic uniforms marching in precise displays and displaying phallic gestures and paraphernalia will have a powerful appeal to ordinary human beings. Feric Jaggar comes to power in Heldon through little more than a grotesque series of increasingly grandiose phallic displays. This is undoubtedly phallic fetishism on the part of the author, since the alternative conclusion is to accept the ridiculous notion that an entire nation would throw itself at the feet of a leader simply on the basis of mass displays of public fetishism, orgies of blatant phallic symbolism, and mass rallies enlivened with torchlight and rabid oratory. Obviously, such a mass national psychosis could never occur in the real world..."" pg 249

The novel begins with the story of Antar, a resident of the future New York doing data processing for the International Water Council. A chance bit of data causes Antar to recall a bizarre encounter he had with L. Murugan, an employee of the LifeWatch organization (Antar's former employer), who disappeared in Calcutta in 1995. Murugan had asked to be transferred to Calcutta because of his fascination with the life of 
Sir Ronald Ross
. While Antar tries to track Murugan’s movements in Calcutta through the digitized archives, another narrative thread follows Murugan directly as his path brings him into contact with a variety of other characters, some more savory than others. The plot is quite complex and its timelines are deliberately mixed up, switching from Antar's time to Murugan's to Ross's and back over the course of as many chapters.

Through his research into old and lost documents and phone messages, Antar determines that Murugan had systematically unearthed a deep secret lurking behind Ross's malaria research — an underground scientific and mystical movement that could grant eternal life. Loosely described, the process of securing this form of immortality is as follows: the disciples of this movement can transfer their chromosomes into another's body, and gradually become that person or take over that person. In the novel, Ronald Ross did not discover the mysteries of the malaria parasite; it was a group of underground practitioners of a different, mystical ""science,"" natives of India, who helped to guide Ross to the conclusions for which he is famous. These native Indians provided Ross with clues in the belief that in the moment Ross made his discovery, the parasite would change its nature. At this point, a new variant of malaria would emerge and the group's research using the chromosome-transfer technique would advance even further."

In the year 2019, the 
SETI
 program at 
Arecibo Observatory
 discovers radio broadcasts of music from the vicinity of 
Alpha Centauri
. The first expedition to Rakhat, the world that is sending the music, is organized by the 
Society of Jesus
 (Jesuits), known for its 
missionary
, linguistic and scientific activities since the time of its founder, 
Ignatius of Loyola
. In the year 2060, only one of the crew, the Jesuit priest Emilio Sandoz, survives to return to Earth, and he is damaged physically and psychologically. The story is told with parallel plot lines, interspersing the journey of Sandoz and his friends to Rakhat with Sandoz's experiences upon his return to Earth.

Father Sandoz is a talented 
Puerto Rican
 
linguist
. He is described as of mixed 
Taíno
 and 
Conquistador
 heritage and character. Sandoz grew up in 
La Perla
, a poor neighborhood in 
San Juan
. He joined the Jesuits as a teenager. After several stints at Jesuit missionaries around the world, he returns to Puerto Rico. Several of his close friends and co-workers, people with a variety of unique skills and talents, have seemingly coincidental connections to Arecibo. One of them, a gifted young technician, was the first to hear the transmissions; another, Sofia Mendes, a 
Turkish Jewish
 
artificial intelligence
 specialist, has the connections and aptitude to obtain a spacecraft and help pilot the mission. Sandoz, who has often struggled with his faith, becomes convinced that only God's will could bring this group of people with the perfect combination of knowledge and experience together at the moment when the alien signal was detected. Sandoz and his friends, along with three other Jesuit priests, are chosen by the Society of Jesus to travel in secret to the planet, using an 
interstellar vessel
 made with a small 
asteroid
.

Upon reaching Rakhat, the crew tries to acclimatize themselves to the new world, experimenting with eating local 
flora
 and 
fauna
, then making contact with a rural village, inhabited by a peaceful tribe of 
herbivore
 
gatherers
, the Runa. Though the Runa are clearly not the singers of the radio broadcasts, the Earthlings settle among them and begin to learn their language (Ruanja) and culture. Although Sandoz struggles with his attraction to Sofia, he finds greater spiritual meaning in his interactions with the Runa. The crew transmits all their findings via computer uplink to the asteroid-ship in 
orbit
. One day, in an attempt to retrieve supplies from their landing vehicle for a sick crew member, the landing vehicle runs short of the fuel needed to safely return to the asteroid ship, and the crew must face the reality that they may never return to Earth.

When the Earthlings finally meet a member of the culture that produced the radio transmissions, he proves to be of an entirely different species from the rural natives, a Jana'ata. He is an ambitious merchant named Supaari VaGayjur. Supaari VaGayjur sees in the visitors a possibility to improve his status, while the crew hopes to find an alternative source of fuel in Supaari's city, Gayjur. Meanwhile, the crew begins to grow their own food, introducing the concept of agriculture to the villagers. These seemingly innocent actions and accompanying cultural misunderstandings precipitate an outbreak of violence. Though not closely related genetically, the Jana'ata have evolved by 
aggressive mimicry
 to physically resemble the Runa, who are in fact their prey species. The human introduction of agriculture leads to a Runa 
baby boom
 which is harvested by the predatory Jana'ata. The humans are riven with guilt over their misguided action, and most of the crew are killed when defending against the Jana'ata attack. Only Sandoz and Marc Robichaux survive, and Sandoz endures capture, degradation, and a crisis of faith. Eventually found by Supaari, Sandoz's hands are disfigured and rendered useless in a Jana'ata practice meant to convey the honor and privilege of being dependent on another, a mutilation analogous to the practice of 
foot binding
. The mutilation kills the other surviving crew member; Sandoz survives, though he is physically and spiritually traumatized,  believing himself at fault for the death of his friends. Later, Supaari gives Sandoz to the Reshtar of Galatna, a poet and musician, in exchange for the right to have a wife and start his own lineage. Held captive by the Reshtar, Sandoz realizes the Reshtar is the source of the music that brought the humans to Rakhat and momentarily regains his faith; however, the Reshtar is only interested in Sandoz as a pet who is 
forced to sexually satisfy
 the musician, along with his friends and colleagues. It is later revealed that the Reshtar broadcasts songs about his sexual exploits, songs which may have been heard on Earth.

When Sandoz returns to Earth in 2060, his friends are dead, and his faith, once considered worthy of 
canonization
 by his superiors, has turned into 
bitter anger with the god
 who inspired him to go to Rakhat. Due to 
relativistic space-time effects
, decades had passed while he has been gone, during which popular outrage at the 
United Nations
' initial and highly out-of-context report on the mission, 
especially Sandoz's role in the tragedy, had left the Society of Jesus shattered, nearly extinct. The Jesuits shelter Sandoz from the media and help him recover physically, while the Father Superior selects a panel of Jesuit priests from around the world to help Sandoz come out of his shell and explain what really happened. Initially bent on discovering the truth, the other priests eventually recognize the great personal cost at which the journey came, and accept Sandoz's epic struggle with his faith. Over the course of several months, Sandoz painfully explains his story and begins his personal healing."

Kirth Gersen pursues the notorious criminal Lens Larque, one of the five so-called Demon Princes, across several worlds, most notably Aloysius, the harsh desert world Dar Sai (inhabited by the Darsh, of whom Larque is one) and the more temperate and genteel Methel, which has grown rich doing business on Dar Sai. Gersen determines that Larque is connected somehow with a seemingly worthless Dar Sai company called Kotzash Mutual. Gersen, by dint of skill and cleverness, gains control of the company. He also rescues Jerdian Chanseth, a young aristocratic Methlen woman, from a Darsh man, and a brief romance blossoms between them.

Gersen then travels to Methel to investigate Kotzash. He attempts to renew his relationship with Jerdian, going so far as to buy the mansion next to her family's, but is rejected as a suitor by her father, bank owner Adario Chanseth, who uses the law to nullify the sale of the house. It turns out that Larque had himself tried to buy the same estate, but had also been thwarted by the same Methlen law, with Chanseth telling Larque (not knowing who he was at the time) that he had no wish to see his ""great Darsh face hanging over my garden fence.""

Gersen learns that Kotzash Mutual has done extensive work on Shanitra, the small moon of Methel, for some mysterious reason. It is well known that Shanitra has no useful deposits of ore and is practically worthless. Nonetheless, Kotzash has gone to great pains to place explosives all across its surface.

Gersen finally tracks Larque down on Methel and fatally poisons him. In his final moments, Larque begs Gersen to press a button, but Gersen denies him his last request, at least while he is alive to enjoy his most grandiose scheme. However, after Larque is dead, Gersen considers, then presses it. Explosives are set off which shape Shanitra into the semblance of Larque's face. He then phones Chanseth and informs him, ""There's a great Darsh face hanging over the garden wall."""

Twenty astronauts aboard an interstellar 
""ramship""
 colonized the Smoke Ring five hundred years before the story begins. Their descendants have adapted their cultures to the free-fall environment. Without gravity, even those who live in integral tree tufts are much taller than Earth-average humans, having grown up in much weaker tides. Many people are able to use their longer, 
prehensile
 toes as another set of fingers. The small number of devices left from the original crew are coveted items in Smoke Ring societies.

Quinn Tribe inhabits the ""in tuft"" of Dalton-Quinn tree. They normally subsist on the tree's cottony foliage, augmented by hunting and a flock of domesticated turkeys. But since the tree passed near Gold six earth years ago it has been falling toward Voy, nearly dropping out of the Smoke Ring.  As a result, the tribe suffers a severe drought. The tribe's leader, the chairman, decides to send a party of nine up the tree, ostensibly to hunt and re-cut tribal markings into the trunk. The group consists mostly of people with disability and people the chairman dislikes, including the chairman's son-in-law (and rival) Clave, and Jeffer, the Scientist's apprentice.

When they approach the midpoint they notice that the tribal markings are different; upon reaching it, they are attacked by members of the Dalton-Quinn tribe who live at the other end of the tree. During the battle a massive tremor splits the tree in half, causing the in tuft to fall farther toward Voy (killing its inhabitants) and allowing the out tuft to find a new equilibrium that is closer to the Smoke Ring's median. The seven surviving members of the Quinn Tribe and one of the attackers jump clear of the shattered tree and are left adrift in the sky with only a few ""jet pods"" (high pressure seed cases that provide a temporary thrust when opened) as their only method of propulsion.

Before dying of thirst, they hook a passing ""moby"" (a flying whale-like creature) which takes them to a ""jungle"", which is a floating mass of plant life. They cut loose, crash, and find themselves in the middle of a battle between the Carther States, who live in the jungle, and slave-runners from London Tree. The group is split when six of them are captured by the slavers; the other two remain in the jungle.

Carther States counter-attacks some weeks later, and the Quinn Tribe group is reunited. During the battle they steal London Tree's CARM (Cargo And Repair Module), a small spacecraft—a relic of the original settlers. The CARM is still functional due to careful management and its robust design; its 
solar panels
 provide electricity to 
electrolyze
 water into 
hydrogen
 and 
oxygen
, which it stores automatically and then burns for propulsion as needed. London Tree's ""Navy"", bow- and spear-armed warriors, use the CARM to conduct long-distance military actions and slave raids on a scale impossible for wingless humans in a zero-g environment.

Not fully understanding how to pilot the CARM, the Quinn and Carther warriors engage its main rocket motor, which accelerates the ship at several 
g
, enough to prevent the crew from reaching the controls to turn the motor off. The CARM is propelled up into the thinnest part of the gas torus before running dangerously low on fuel. As a result, they become the first Smoke Ring inhabitants in centuries to see the naked stars.

Unknown to any of the inhabitants of the Smoke Ring, 
Discipline,
 the ship in which their ancestors arrived, remains in orbit, and its 
AI
 autopilot, Kendy, has been attempting to watch their progress. When Kendy sees the CARM dangerously far from the habitable area of the Ring he contacts them. With help from the on-board computer and after some interaction with Kendy, the occupants of the CARM eventually safely return to the Smoke Ring. Unable to reach any of the trees that they know, they decide to settle on a new tree, which they dub ""Citizens' Tree""."

Charlie Johns wakes up in Ledom (model backwards), a world of 
gender-neutral
 people. He believes that he has been transported to the future, and the Ledom tell him that humanity has been destroyed by nuclear war.

He meets Seace, the head of the Science One, who explains the A-field, an invisible force field the Ledom use for everything from spoons to buildings. He meets Mielwis, the head of the Medical One, who explains to him how the Ledom came to be gender-neutral by a mutation. Mielwis tells him that the Ledom have both genital organs, which drop down when they are aroused and retract when they are not in use.

He meets Nasive and Grocid, the heads of the Children's Ones, who explain Ledom religion to him. The Ledom worship children because ""it is inconceivable we would ever obey one"".

Then Philos, a historian, leads him to the cerebrostyle, a technology that allows a viewer to watch recorded memories in their mind. Charlie reads a ""letter"" in this machine which is a manifesto of Ledom society. It tells how sexual differences have caused strife for humans and how Ledom society has achieved harmony by following a 
charitic
 religion and creating a gender-neutral culture.

After he has finished reading the letter, Philos takes Charlie out to the edges of Ledom, where he finds Philos's partner Froure and their child Soutin. Philos had let the Ledom think Froure and Soutin had died in a landslide because the Ledom, despite what Mielwis had told Charlie, did not mutate but undergo monthly medical procedures to keep them gender-neutral, and Philos does not want this to happen to Soutin. Philos asks Charlie if he will take Soutin back to his time period, and Charlie agrees.

They go back to the Science One and after a short confrontation with Seace, Charlie takes Soutin into the time machine. However, the time machine does not go anywhere and Charlie realizes he is stuck in Ledom. Mielwis asks him for his opinion about Ledom. Charlie says they are all freaks and if humanity knew they existed, humans would kill every one of them.

Mielwis knocks Charlie unconscious and confers with Nasive about how humanity is not yet ready for gender equality.

Charlie is allowed to live with Philos, Froure, and Soutin at the edge of Ledom. The book ends with nuclear bombs bursting in the sky, with the Ledom and Charlie being protected by the A-field."

Alvin's family is 
migrating
 west. When they try to cross the Hatrack River, an unknown force, known as the Unmaker, tries to stop the still-unborn Alvin from being born since Alvin would be the seventh son of a seventh son and therefore have incredible powers as a Maker. The force sends a tree down the river to crush the wagon the pregnant Mrs. Miller is riding in. Her eldest son, Vigor, diverts the tree but is mortally wounded in the act. Because a seventh son must be born while the other six are alive, Vigor desperately clings to life until Alvin is born.

Help is dispatched at the insistence of five-year-old ""torch"" (a person who, among other things, can see the life forces of people and, under certain conditions, their myriad alternate futures) Peggy Guester, who sees Alvin and Alvin's possible future as a Maker.

As the years pass, Alvin avoids numerous attempts of an unknown force trying to kill him and us often helped by the intervention of a mysterious protector. Alvin's father, a nonbeliever in God, believes that a water spirit is trying to kill Alvin. When Alvin is seven, a new Reverend, named Thrower, arrives in town and tries to build a church. Alvin's father refuses to help, but Mrs. Miller has all of her sons work on building the church. When the ridgebeam is being placed onto the church in construction, it shivers and breaks and seems about to fall on Alvin. However, mid-air, it breaks in two and misses Alvin, which is yet another example of Alvin's near-death experiences. When Alvin goes home, he provokes one of his sisters by poking her and so they get revenge on Alvin by putting needles into his night gown. Alvin avenges himself by using his knack to send 
cockroaches
 after his sisters. The plan works, and Alvin has a victory over his sisters. However, he then has a vision that he dubs Shining Man, who makes him promise to use his knack only for good.

When Alvin is ten, ""Taleswapper"" (
William Blake
), a traveling storyteller, arrives in the town that Alvin's parents have founded. After stopping by the house of Alvin's brother-in-law, who directs Taleswapper to the Miller house, he visits the church and notices that its altar has been touched upon by an evil entity. Reverend Thrower kicks him out, and Taleswapper goes to the Millers' place, where his timely intervention stops Mr. Miller from killing Alvin. Taleswapper is welcomed in and helps to put a name to the unknown force that tries to stop Alvin from realizing his true powers as a Maker: 
the Unmaker
. Meanwhile, the Reverend Philadelphia Thrower becomes a tool of the Unmaker, the evil force that touched the altar.

Soon, the Miller family goes to a quarry to cut out a millstone. Here, one of Alvin's knacks is revealed since he singlehandedly cuts the millstone through hard rock. During the night, Taleswapper and Mr. Miller guard the millstone. Mr. Miller tells Taleswapper a story about how a force is trying to use him to kill Alvin. Taleswapper advises Mr. Miller to send Alvin away to somewhere he may be safe. The next day, the millstone is taken home. The Unmaker finally manages to injure Alvin by making a millstone fall on him. Taleswapper encourages him to heal himself. Alvin does so but finds that he cannot heal himself part of his bone. He realizes that he might need outside help to heal. Reverend Thrower, acting as a surgeon, attempts to kill him but finds himself blocked by a mysterious force. Alvin heals himself with the aid of his brother Measure, who performs the surgery. Alvin is contracted as an apprentice to a blacksmith in the town on the Hatrack River in which he was born.

Taleswapper meets Peggy. It is revealed that she, using her torch powers and Alvin's birth caul, had protected Alvin all of those years, and the Unmaker hurt Alvin with the millstone only because Alvin himself overrode her powers.

 In the book, the rock contain a form of 
grey goo
 called ""moonseed"" that starts to change all inorganic matter on 
Earth
 into more moonseed. It also gets transferred by a NASA probe to 
Venus
, and the explosion of Venus is the first clue as to what has been happening.

Stephen Baxter combines a host of disciplines (
space travel
, geology and 
disaster theory
) to tell a tale where the rocks are literally swept from under the feet of humanity. During the course of the novel, in which 
Edinburgh
 is the focus for much of the action, 
Venus
 is destroyed by an unknown cosmic event that showers the Earth with radiation that somehow stirs the moonseed on Earth. When Moon-dust containing the moonseed is dropped onto the streets of 
Edinburgh
 by a lab assistant of the main character, Earth's fate is sealed.  The moonseed begins to disintegrate the planet from the inside-out as the core heats up exponentially, while on the surface, 
nuclear power stations
 catastrophically fail, earthquakes and 
volcanic eruptions
 are abundant, and billions of people die as cities and continents vanish.

Over the course of the cataclysmic erosion of Earth, a collective of scientists and engineers in space agencies from around the world desperately try to 
terraform the Moon
 for colonisation, to provide a safe haven for some surviving humans before Earth eventually disintegrates into 
nothingness
 along with human civilisation.

This novel also presents numerous theories and ideas about the space-faring future of humanity, albeit in an alternate dimension where we are forced into space by an eroding Earth. It is also, in many stages, critical of

Sparrow refuses to join the mutiny with his friends against Kusaka, but is torn since he knows they won't survive the trip and that chances of finding life are almost nonexistent, thus making the mission futile but the Captain won't accept it. Things change when Sparrow slowly discovers that he is also immortal like the Captain, and that he has lived previous ""lives"" on the ship as the same man but with different names and his memories of every previous identity are erased every generation by orders of the Captain. He learns that he originally volunteered for the role to be the mirror for every crew to ""remember what its like to be human""; since they've been isolated from the rest of humanity over the centuries the crew has formed their own 
collective-mind
 culture that's overly benign and incapable of harm since they regard life as the most precious thing in existence (also makes them reluctant to mutiny). Sparrow also learns that he was the first mutineer and Kusaka erased his memories to keep the crew in line and Sparrow from seizing control of the ship since the 
Astron's
 central computer only responds to the minds of the immortal crew members, and should they be removed the ship would not function and would drift through space forever.

When they leave the last star system explored to enter ""the Dark"", Captain Kusaka tries to suppress the conspirators even though they are benign, but Sparrow gives them the resolution to fight when they realize that since the ship has traveled so far through 
relativistic time dilation
, human civilization on Earth may have ceased to exist and that they may be the only known lifeforms left in the universe. Moreover, since the governments that sent them out no longer exist, Kusaka is no longer lawfully in command. In a last-ditch attempt at mutiny, most of the crew get on shuttles and landers and leave the ship, preferring to die quickly in space than to venture into ""the Dark"" with Kusaka. Meanwhile, before the mutineers' life support fails, Sparrow fights Kusaka alone in a hidden room that holds the preserved remains of the original first generation crew. This triggers all of Sparrow's memories and past personalities to surface at once in a 
dissociative identity
 breakdown, which leads to the resurfacing of his original identity: Raymond Stone, who was the return trip Captain. In the ensuing fight, Raymond fatally wounds Kusaka.

With the mutiny over, Raymond takes command of the 
Astron
 and sets a course back to Earth, which takes 20 generations (400 years) to reach. During that time, Raymond watches the crew he has known age and die and recycled for mass and minerals on the ship as well as their descendant crews come and go, thus making him realize the value of life and the price of immortality.

The story ends when the 
Astron
, after 2500 ship-years (or approximately 17,000 time-dilated 
Julian years
 as calculated earlier), finally returns to an uninhabited Earth for the descendants of the original crew and Raymond to repopulate. While they are celebrating, they are shocked to discover an 
alien
 ship has also found Earth."

v
t
e


A belief is spreading in conquered China that the government has lost the 
Mandate of Heaven
. 
Han Tzu
 meets up with 
Mazer Rackham
, who passes him a blow dart pen, calling it the ""Mandate of Heaven"". Han Tzu confronts the emperor, Snow Tiger, who is shot and killed by a guard, allowing Han Tzu to overthrow the Chinese government and install himself as the new emperor.  Meanwhile, 
Peter Wiggin
, Hegemon of Earth, along with 
Petra Arkanian
, goes to visit 
Alai
, 
Caliph
 of the 
Muslim
 League. The two help Alai realize that he is little more than a glorified prisoner, and that others have been ruling 
Islam
 in his stead. After uncovering a conspiracy against him, Alai resolves to take firmer control of his nation and guarantee the human rights of his subjugated peoples.

The rest of the book deals with Peter Wiggin working to create a world government free of war through his Free People of Earth (FPE) alliance. Caliph Alai of the Muslim League and 
Virlomi
, now the virtual goddess of 
India
, oppose his efforts.  Against this backdrop of world political machinations by the former Battle School children is the extremely personal story of Julian (
Bean
) Delphiki. Anton's Key is making him grow at an astounding rate and he has only a short time before his body will become too large for his 
heart
 to support.  He searches frantically for his and Petra's missing children. Graff assists them in locating the surrogate mothers of their children. While Bean and Petra wait for news, Graff extends invitations to the other members of Ender's Jeesh to leave Earth and rule colonies, where they can conquer to their heart's content without causing needless wars between themselves, and instructs Bean to support Peter in forming the FPE.

The FPE alliance begins with only twenty-two countries, among them  
Brazil
, 
Rwanda
, and the 
Netherlands
. The first test of the FPE comes when they recognize the sovereignty and nationhood of the 
Nubian
, 
Quechua
, and 
Aymara
 peoples, ethnic minorities that are politically part of other nations.  
Peru
 and 
Sudan
 send troops against these ""rebel"" strongholds, but Peter defends them using Bean and 
Suriyawong
, leading 
Rwandan
 and 
Thai
 troops, to show that war against one FPE member is war against all of them. The FPE's victories, and especially their militarily brilliant commanders, bolster support for the FPE, and nations begin to freely vote on whether to join it.

Meanwhile, Bean suspects that Peter is embezzling 
Ender
's military pension to fund the FPE, so he requests that Ender's funds be placed under the control of an autonomous computer. 
Colonel Graff
 has the Mind Game reprogrammed to accurately predict financial markets and turns it loose over the ansible network, where it continues to invest Ender's pension and, as revealed later in the Enderverse chronology, eventually evolves into the 
artificial intelligence
 known as 
Jane
. The Mind Game also speeds the search for Bean's missing children, allowing the International Fleet to find eight of them;  two of whom have Anton's Key turned, as does the baby Petra is carrying.  The ninth remains undetected, as Achilles had it implanted into a woman named Randi, 
brainwashed
 to think that it is the baby of Achilles, whom she worships as a hero assassinated by foul enemies.  To avoid persecution, Randi determines to leave Earth and live in a colony, where she can raise her child (who appears to have Anton's Key turned, as the baby is born prematurely) to follow in Achilles' footsteps.  Her story, and that of her child Randall Firth, is concluded in Card's later novel 
Ender in Exile
.

Virlomi attempts to guarantee India's freedom via dynastic marriage, turning down an offer from Han Tzu to instead attempt to seduce Peter Wiggin.  When Peter turns her down, she turns to Alai whom she finds easier to outmaneuver.  Their new marriage is fraught with tension and Alai discovers that, despite his wife's status as an infidel and a woman, the more hotheaded members of his empire actually prefer her aggressive and expansionist policies.  Virlomi then declares war on China, setting off all manner of plots: Muslim hardliners attempt to assassinate Alai; Russia invades China and eastern Europe using ""contingency"" plans drawn up by a horrified Vlad; and 
Fly Molo
 of the 
Philippines
 is instructed to invade 
Taiwan
, his nation suicidally confident in their Jeesh member.  In these different ways, all the Battle School grads are convinced to take up Graff's offer to travel the stars, realizing that their presence on Earth guarantees continued and wasteful war.  Even Virlomi agrees, after Suri manages to snap her out of her growing 
megalomania
.

With the secret help of Mazer Rackham, Bean divorces Petra for her own sake, takes the three found children with Anton's Key, and flies away on a starship provided by the Fleet to achieve 
relativistic speeds
 and thereby stay alive long enough for medical researchers to find a cure.  Bean's departure breaks Petra's heart, but she becomes Peter's military commander, eventually marrying and having five children with him, though she never stops loving Bean. By the end of the novel, all of the world's nations, except the United States, have joined the FPE.  Peter reconciles with Ender via 
ansible
, giving the ""Speaker for the Dead"" all he needs to write 
The Hegemon
, a deeply felt and truthful biography of his brother. Petra reads his biography at his grave, thinking of him as the man who truly changed her life. Still, Bean remains the one whom she loves and has changed her life the most.

Two years pass after the Battle on Starship Hill on Tines World. The exiled Tine pack Vendacious travels to the city of East Home, seeking to ally with Tycoon, the world's richest businessman. Over the next year, Vendacious helps Tycoon expand his enterprise (using a stolen human dataset) and undertake an expedition to the Tropical Choir, a legendary mob of over one hundred million Tines living in the world's equatorial region. Meanwhile, Ravna Bergsndot has slowly begun reviving the human Children who have been kept in cold sleep pods since their flight from High Lab and the Blight at the galaxy's edge. Although the Blight was effectively destroyed by Countermeasure, its fleet survives stranded 30 light-years away from Tines World, presumably developing ramscoop technology to resume its journey. Ravna hopes to use the technical archives on the crippled 
Out of Band II
 (
Oobii
) to elevate Woodcarver's Domain and Tines World to a level of technology advanced enough to combat the Blight's remnant. The Blight may yet take decades or even centuries to arrive, but when the Zone boundaries briefly shift, those estimates become questionable.

Ten years after the Battle on Starship Hill, Ravna's plans begin to crumble. She learns of a faction of Children calling themselves the Disaster Study Group who believe that the Blight's fleet is a rescue party sent for them, and that Countermeasure, having destroyed countless civilizations by moving the Slow Zone to quell the Blight, is the true evil. When Ravna tries to explain to an assembly of Children the importance of adhering to her schedule for advancing Tines World, she is upstaged and betrayed by Nevil Storherte, who convinces most of the Children that Ravna is obsessed and misguided, and that he should be the one to lead them. Nevil then forces Ravna to turn over 
sysadmin
 authority of 
Oobii
 to him, granting him access to its archives, systems, and weapons; however, Ravna secretly retains Command Privilege over the starship, a status that supersedes sysadmin.

Support for Nevil's leadership begins to falter as the medical advances he promised fail to bear fruit. Ravna conspires with Johanna Olsndot and the pack Pilgrim to force Nevil to compromise. Before that can happen, three of the youngest Children are kidnapped, ostensibly by Tines from the Tropics. Nevil uses the opportunity to leverage more power. Later, while Johanna and Pilgrim travel to investigate the Tropics, Ravna is kidnapped herself, and Johanna and Pilgrim crash into Tycoon's Reservation in the Tropics. It is revealed that Nevil was behind all three incidents and for several years has been allied with Tycoon and Vendacious to undermine Ravna and Woodcarver. In the Tropics, Pilgrim is lost to the Choir and Johanna escapes aboard a Tropical trade convoy bound for Woodcarver's Domain. Ravna, with the help of Jefri Olsndot, his friend pack Amdiranifani, and the pack Screwfloss (a rehabilitated Lord Steel), escapes her captors and attempts to return to Woodcarver's Domain to stop Nevil's tyranny. On the way, however, the four are re-captured and taken to the Tropics aboard two of Tycoon's airships. Back on 
Oobii
, now under Nevil's control, Nevil's second-in-command Bili Yngva witnesses a massive Zone shift recorded by the ship's sensors. For a few minutes, Tines World is part of the Beyond and the ""rescue party"" fleet is estimated to close to within 20 light-years.

Ravna and company arrive at Tycoon's Reservation, where they learn that Tycoon, under Vendacious' influence, is on the verge of forcing Woodcarver to accede to an alliance, thereby removing Woodcarver's Domain as a threat to Tycoon's rapidly growing business empire. Later, when the meeting that Nevil had coordinated to force the ""alliance"" on Woodcarver and solidify his control over the Children occurs, it ends disastrously for him. Ravna regains control of 
Oobii
 with her Command Privilege, Vendacious is killed by a mutiny of his airship's crew, and Tycoon flees to the Tropics with Johanna (whom Tycoon believes to have killed his brother-pack, Scriber Jaqueramaphan) as an apparent hostage. Nevil and his fellow Disaster Study Group members (nearly half of all the Children) depart and establish their own settlement, ""Best Hope"", in a distant valley. Sometime later, Nevil announces that he remains allied with Tycoon, and Tycoon will soon return several hostages taken over the years: the two survivors among the Children kidnapped earlier, and the packs Amdiranifani and Screwfloss. Ravna and Jefri are disappointed when Johanna is not returned as well, but Johanna secretly reveals to Ravna that she has since become Tycoon's advisor and that their support of Nevil is a temporary ruse. In reality, Tycoon is forging a business partnership with Woodcarver and Ravna, who can provide technical expertise from 
Oobii
.

The story concludes as Johanna, in the Tropics with Tycoon, speculates that with Tycoon's industrial power and the condensed information of countless civilizations in 
Oobii'
s archives, decades' worth of technological progress could be made in a couple of years. In Woodcarver's Domain, Ravna prays that Tines World will be ready for the Blight, which to her knowledge is still 30 light-years away."

A group of rebels attempting to overthrow both tyrants and win back their homeland.  Many of the rebels are natives of the province of Tigana, which was the province that most ably resisted Brandin; in a crucial battle, Brandin's son was killed. In retaliation for this, Brandin attacked Tigana and crushed it more savagely than any other part of the Palm; then he used his magic to remove the name and history of Tigana from the minds of the population.  Brandin named it Lower Corte, making Corte, their traditional enemies to their north, seem superior to a land that was all but forgotten.

Only those born in Tigana before the invasion can hear or speak its name, or remember it as it was; as far as everyone else is concerned, that area of the country has always been an insignificant part of a neighbouring province, hence the rebels are battling for the very soul of their country.

In the end the rebels engineer a battle between their two enemies hoping they will defeat each other.  After victory, the magic preventing others from remembering the province of Tigana is removed."

After arriving in the Earth's solar system, the Conquest Fleet's essential personnel are awakened from cold sleep after a 20-year journey originating from 
Tau Ceti
 II. Fleetlord Atvar, busy making the final preparations for the invasion of Earth, expects a rapid victory over the primitive beings populating the planet. He is interrupted by a communications officer, who reports that radio emissions are emanating from 
Earth
. Atvar refuses to believe the report since the most recent intelligence, gathered from a probe that visited Earth in the 
12th century AD
, indicates that the inhabitants are a pre-industrial species.

The Conquest Fleet reaches Earth orbit in December 1941 and begins surveying the planet. It is shocked to find that in the course of only 800 years, the inhabitants have moved from a primitive agricultural society to an industrial civilization. The Race's technology has hardly changed in more than 50,000 years, and other known intelligent species are similarly slow to evolve.

After six months of reconnaissance and intelligence gathering, Atvar consults in May 1942 with the Shiplords of the Conquest Fleet. The troops have been awakened from cold sleep and are prepared to commence with military operations. However, Atvar can, technically, cancel the invasion. Unwilling to call off the attack and face the Emperor back on Home, Atvar orders the assault to begin.

Soon, the Race detonates several atomic bombs above the Earth's atmosphere in an attempt to disrupt human communications, and the attack begins.

On the night of May 30, only hours after detonating the nuclear bombs, the Race's forces attack human aircraft and ground vehicles in and around designated landing zones. Once the sites are secured, troop ships begin landing and disgorging ground forces. The Race simultaneously establishes bases on every continent except 
Antarctica
.

Latin America
 and 
Africa
 are overrun almost immediately, with 
Mexico
 the only one resisting the invaders but falling a week after fierce fighting. Landing bases in 
Florida
, 
Illinois
, 
Idaho
, and 
New York State
 cause widespread panic and chaos in the 
United States
. The Race's forces establish bases in 
occupied Poland
, cutting 
Nazi Germany
 off from the bulk of its forces in the 
Soviet Union
 and resulting in a massive German retreat westward. The 
United Kingdom
's air forces are battered from alien bases in 
Spain
 and 
France
. The Soviet Union must deal with enemy strongholds in 
Ukraine
, 
Outer Mongolia
, and 
Siberia
. Everywhere, humankind falls back in the face of a seemingly-unstoppable nemesis.

Hostilities between the 
Axis
 and 
Allied powers
 end almost immediately, simply because there is no other viable option. With the Race's forces battering the human armies into submission, no resources can be expended on human rivalries. The unsettling reality of the new balance of power is emphasized by the fact that in the early days of the fighting, only Germany is able to battle the aliens with any measure of success. That is only natural since Germany has been at war longer than the other major powers and has an economy specifically geared toward war. However, Americans are nauseated by the idea of fighting on the same side as Hitler, and the Soviets, having already been betrayed and attacked by the Germans, are at best reluctant to be working alongside them.

After the initial assault, the Race's troops come to a virtual standstill. It is not so much human resistance that keeps them from advancing as much as its tendency to deliberate their options before acting. Mankind takes advantage of the respite provided to wage localized counterattacks, nearly all of which are unsuccessful. In the process, it finds that the Race lacks tactical combat initiative and can be easily lured into traps, but their advanced tech makes exploiting these weaknesses almost impossible. The Race also discovers that its orbital atomic detonations had little or no effect on the human militaries. It had thought that the resulting 
electro-magnetic pulse
 would short out any advanced technology of humans, but it soon realizes that humans do not yet possess silicon computer chips. Most human electronics, such as radios, use 
vacuum tubes
, which are less efficient but also more resistant to electro-magnetic interference.

Hitler takes advantage of the brief lull in the fighting in an artillery unit in Ukraine to attack an alien base using 
railroad guns
. The German battery manages to destroy two of the Race's ships (the 
67th Emperor Sohrheb
 and the 
56th Emperor Jossano
), including the one that carries the bulk of the Conquest Fleet's atomic stockpile. The resulting explosion sends chunks of 
plutonium
 flying across several acres. Soviet partisans take notice of the care with which the Race goes about collecting the strange metal.

Elsewhere in Ukraine, Major Heinrich Jäger manages to destroy one of the Race's landcruisers and a troop carrier, and another panzer unit and infantry destroy a second landcruiser but at the cost of his entire 
panzer
 company. Narrowly escaping from the battle, he is found by Lieutenant Ludmila Gorbunova, who flies him back to the airfield in which she is stationed. From there, Jäger is sent to Moscow where he spends several weeks as an ambiguous guest of the Soviet government, considered neither an official prisoner-of-war nor an ally. Finally, he is asked to take part in a joint German-Soviet operation in Ukraine that is aimed at recovering some of the plutonium.

The 
ad hoc
 band of Soviet partisans and displaced German soldiers that is charged with the assignment manages to hijack a shipment of plutonium. In accordance with negotiated arrangements, the load is divided into two, and they go their separate ways. Jäger is given a horse and is forced to ride across the Ukrainian steppe and enemy-occupied Poland to reach Germany with the precious metal. Somewhere between the towns of 
Chernobyl
 and 
Hrubieszów
, Jäger is ambushed by 
Jewish partisans
. Though they are nominally allies of the Race, the Jews recognize the threat that the 
aliens pose to mankind
. They take half the plutonium in Jäger's possession and let him return to Germany with the other half. The Jewish partisans send their commandeered plutonium to 
England
, where it is subsequently shipped to the United States.

Upon his arrival in Germany, Jäger is promoted to the rank of colonel and awarded the 
German Cross
 in Gold at a ceremony held in 
Berchtesgaden
, 
Hitler
's 
Bavarian
 resort. While Jäger enjoys a well-deserved furlough there, 
Vyacheslav Molotov
 arrives to consult with Hitler on the conduct of the war. The Soviet ambassador is flown to Bavaria by Lieutenant Gorbunova, to Jäger's surprise. Jäger and Gorbunova grow close during their short time together.

In an attempt to reduce human resistance, Atvar orders the use of atomic weapons on 
Washington, DC
, and 
Berlin
, hoping to persuade the Americans and the Germans to surrender. Berlin is hit first, primarily in retaliation for the destruction of the Race's ships in Ukraine. Atvar regrets the need to atomize human territory, mostly because Earth has much less land than sea, but he sees the display of power as necessary since Germany fields the strongest human army. The Race is less dismayed by the attack on Washington, DC, since it is an administrative and communications center, with few industrial and commercial resources. Furthermore, Atvar rationalizes that most of the radioactive fallout will drift harmlessly out into the 
Atlantic
. Instead of breaking the human will to resist, the attacks inspire both nations to fight harder and to hasten production of their own atomic weapons.

Meanwhile, in the United States, Jens Larssen is forced to travel to 
White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia
, where the US government has set up a temporary capital after the bombing of Washington, DC. Larssen warns the Army Chief of Staff, General 
George C. Marshall
, that the US Army must defend Chicago at all costs since the metallurgical laboratory stationed at the 
University of Chicago
 is working feverishly to develop atomic power, which might be the only chance of humanity to defeat the Race. Marshall assures Larssen that holding Chicago is a key component of the army's strategy. Satisfied, Larssen makes his way back to the university.

On his way back, Larssen finds that the Race has captured most of 
Ohio
 and 
Indiana
. He carefully makes his way through and around enemy lines. In the process, he spends several weeks in one of the Race's prison camps but manages to convince it that he is no threat to them. Found by US  troops, Larssen explains that he is a physicist on important government business. After several interrogations, Larssen is granted an audience with General 
George S. Patton
, who explains that a major military operation is currently being planned to keep the Race out of Chicago. Since he is so valuable to the war effort and because of the dangers involved, Patton refuses to allow Larssen to proceed to Chicago until the Americans have secured the city.

As the winter of 1942 begins, the Race's attacks begin to lose momentum. On their home planet, snow is extraordinarily rare outside the laboratory, and much of the land is sandy desert, leaving Race forces totally unprepared for the harsh winters often found on Earth. As soon as the first blizzard hits Illinois, a handful of American fighters and bombers, hoarded for the last desperate strike, move against the Race's positions in western Indiana and southern 
Wisconsin
. Massive artillery barrages follow. Finally, American infantry and tank units, under Patton in the east and General 
Omar Bradley
 in the north, move toward their objective, 
Bloomington, Illinois
. Although human 
M4 Shermans
 and 
P-51 Mustangs
 are no match for the Race's landcruisers and killercraft, the alien forces are so badly outnumbered and the weather so inhospitable that they are beaten into a retreat. Under Patton's tremendously energetic, aggressive leadership, US troops move rapidly and manage to encircle some of the Race's slower formations in a ring of armor and destroy them in detail. Mankind scores its first major victory against the nemesis from the stars.

Fleetlord Atvar and the Conquest Fleet's Shiplords begin to grow worried about the war's progress, having lost control of all of northern Illinois. When the invasion began, they were confident that their technological superiority would guarantee a rapid victory, even in the face of expansive human industrial power. While it has managed to subdue 
South America
, 
Africa
, and 
Australia
, the Race still faces stiff resistance in 
North America
, 
Europe
, and 
Asia
 six months after the attack started, and faces the prospect of losing ground in all three theatres.

Having expected a quick and easy victory, the Conquest Fleet finds itself living a logistical nightmare as the humans continue to fight: the Race's more advanced weaponry, such as guided missiles, anti-armor rockets, landcruisers, killercraft, and helicopters, are being destroyed in ever greater numbers, and munitions are rapidly being spent. While simple weapons, such as 
rifles
, 
bullets
, 
artillery
 shells, and 
mortars
, can be replicated in captured human factories, the advanced machines and more complex munitions cannot be replaced. Worse still, the Race has already seen humans are alarmingly adaptable and quick to learn, meaning that the longer the war lasts, the faster the technological gap between the two sides will shrink. Atvar is informed by his intelligence officers that human vehicles are dependent upon 
petroleum
 for fuel and that striking at refineries that process oil might reduce the combat effectiveness of humanity's armies. Atvar orders an airborne attack upon the 
Romanian
 oilfields at 
Ploiești
, but the bombing raid meets with limited success and costs the Race valuable killercraft.

As 1942 nears its end, Patton and Bradley march their forces into Bloomington, and Jens Larssen arrives in Chicago to find the city in ruins. He makes his way through the rubble, encounters a civilian populace in severe disarray, and heads for the University of Chicago. There, Larssen is informed by a custodian that the metallurgical laboratory has evacuated the campus and is relocating to 
Denver
. Like the war, Larssen's journey has a long way to go."

The story centers on Franz Westen, a recovering alcoholic and writer of weird tales, who lives in San Francisco.

The plot unfolds as Westen discovers an old journal belonging to 
Clark Ashton Smith
, a real-life writer of fantasy, horror, and science fiction. In this journal, Smith discusses ""paramentals"", entities that feed off of human emotions and are drawn to urban environments. As Westen delves deeper, he learns about ""megapolisomancy"", a fictional occult science focusing on harnessing the supernatural forces present in large cities.

Westen begins to experience bizarre and terrifying occurrences. He sees mysterious figures on nearby rooftops and encounters eerie phenomena, suggesting the presence of supernatural forces in the city. The novel's climax involves Westen's confrontation with these forces, symbolized by the entity ""Our Lady of Darkness"" – a powerful, ancient being connected to the history and fabric of San Francisco itself."

The novel is broken into 11 parts of varying lengths. The story itself is broken into two sections: the first and shorter section covers the origins of the virus and its outbreak, while the second is set 93 years after the infections, primarily following a colony of survivors living in California. Several narrative devices are used, including email, journal entries, newspaper reports, and 
other documents
.  Occasional use is made of reference material from 1,000 years after the outbreak, coming from 
""The Journal of Sara Fisher""
, sourced from a future ""University of New South Wales, Indo-Australian Republic"".

The U.S. government is conducting a top secret experiment referred to as ""Project Noah"" which involves acquiring and transporting death row inmates to a secret military compound in Colorado, ostensibly for the purposes of testing a drug intended to greatly prolong life. These genetic experiments originate from 
patient zero
, Tim Fanning—one of two surviving members of an expedition investigating a Bolivian bat-carried virus. The virus, while causing 
hemorrhagic fever
 and death in those who initially contracted it, results in a boosting of the immune system and enhanced strength and agility in the current subjects. It is later revealed that Project Noah is intended to produce weaponized enhanced humans for the military, described as ""the ultimate 
bunker busters
"".

The FBI agents responsible for recruiting the prisoners are ordered to collect six-year-old Amy Bellafonte from a 
convent
 and deliver her to Dr. Lear, the head of the project.  At Noah she is exposed to a refined version of the serum administered to ""The Twelve""—the original inmates. Lear theorizes that as Amy's immune system has not had the chance to mature it will form a symbiosis with the virus and live with her symbiotically, instead of the violent forms it has taken with the other twelve.

Of the inmates, the first and last recruited are depicted as being different from the others: Babcock, the original test subject, is stronger and appears to have developed psychic abilities, occasionally influencing his guards and cleaners; and Carter, who was convicted of a 
first-degree murder
 he did not commit.

Zero (AKA Fanning) and the other twelve inmates mentally take control of their guards and escape their quarantine cells, rapidly killing all who stand in their way.  Amy is rescued by Brad Wolgast (the FBI agent who brought her to Noah) and Sister Lacey (a nun who was looking after Amy when she was recruited). Lacey is taken by Carter, as Wolgast and Amy escape to a mountain retreat where they live for several months, occasionally picking up news of the contagion spread throughout America. The rest of the world's fate is not stated, but it is mentioned that most European nations have imposed quarantine and closed their borders.

Despite living reasonably comfortably in the mountain site, Wolgast eventually succumbs to radiation sickness when a nuclear device is detonated nearby—he assumes that the government is attempting to sterilize infected areas of the country—and Amy is left to fend for herself.

The novel shifts forward in time approximately 93 years (with occasional reference retrospectively 1,000 years in the future), and the narrative is taken up around a self-sufficient, walled, 
isolationist
 colony established by the military in conjunction with 
FEMA
 not long after the initial outbreak. The First Colony is in slow decline, although only one character (a technician by the name of Michael Fisher) seems to recognize this; he is trying to establish clandestine radio contact with the outside world to obtain spares for their failing equipment—specifically their 
batteries
 which power the high-wattage lights which protect the colony from the 
virals
, who in traditional vampiric style are highly light-sensitive.

During a nighttime attack, Amy arrives at the gates of the camp, having previously met Peter Jaxon (one of the colony's senior figures) during a foraging expedition. Amy's arrival also results in a break-in from the virals leading to the death of ""Teacher""—the person responsible for the upbringing of all the children under eight in the colony.  Amy now appears to be a fifteen-year-old girl, and upon her arrival is grievously wounded by a crossbow, but her own recuperative powers soon heal her and within days she is as healthy as she was before being injured.

Amy's arrival, her healing abilities, Teacher's death and inner-colony friction (caused by Babcock's mental influence over several Colony figures) force several of the colony dwellers to abscond with Amy and seek out another military site in Colorado—from where Michael has been receiving faint radio signals.

Amy demonstrates a psychic bond with the virals, and manages to keep the group of travelers relatively safe during their journey. They come across another settlement established in a Las Vegas prison, known as the Haven, which, while initially welcoming, is in fact Babcock's lair. The Haven's residents, most under the mental influence of Babcock, ""feed"" him blood sacrifices in exchange for being left alone by the horde of virals at his disposal, referred to as ""The Many"" (as opposed to The Twelve).

Theo Jaxon, Peter's brother who had been captured by virals months earlier, has been imprisoned here. Babcock is slowly attempting to grasp hold of his mind to make him a Familiar, but because he does not give in, he is served as a sacrifice. After resisting Babcock's mental influence, Theo and Mausami (his pregnant lover) are rescued by Peter.

During a botched attempt to kill Babcock during one of the monthly blood sacrifice rituals, sympathizers at the Haven enable the group to escape via railroad, and they arrive at a farmstead. Theo and Maus stay behind so that the baby can be born safely while the rest of the group continue on and eventually meet up with a Texan military group, who provide assistance to Peter and Amy in finding the Colorado outpost.  The others stay with the military group, headed to 
Kerrville
 but are confronted with Babcock's ""Many"" heading over the mountain, so the core friends, along with Major Greer, decide to change course to head for the Colorado outpost instead. The bulk of the military group still continue to Kerrville. Once at the outpost, Peter discovers that it is the same compound where the outbreak started, and still serves as home to Sister Lacey. Lacey, like Amy, was treated by Lear with a modified form of the serum, providing her with longer life and a psychic bond with not only Amy and the virals, but Babcock as well.

It is decided they will lure Babcock into the outpost—Amy and Lacey confirm that he is headed towards them in any case—where they will detonate a nuclear device originally designed to sterilize the compound, but never used. The group theorize that the virals are like a hive mind and once Babcock is dead his hold over the virals created 
exponentially
 by him will cease and they will no longer be a threat. Lacey hands over files on The Twelve, revealing their hometowns, to which she suggests The Twelve will have returned. She also hands over a case of 12 syringes full of the modified serum. While waiting for Babcock to arrive, the group is attacked, resulting in Alicia (""Lish"") becoming infected, and treated by Sara, Michael Fisher's sister and the former medic of the First Colony, with 1 of the 12 syringes of the modified serum.

Upon Babcock's arrival, Lacey lures him to a chamber where she detonates the bomb, destroying herself, Babcock, and much of the outpost. Once Babcock is dead, Amy is finally able to know the virals lives and gives them back memories, telling them who they are. The attacking virals all collapse and willingly wait for the sun to rise so they can die, in most cases leaving behind nothing but dust, proving the hive theory correct.

Lish adapts to the virus in a similar manner to Amy and Lacey before her, yet with differences—she has limited psychic abilities, but has the strength and endurance of a viral.  Greer comments that she would be a formidable soldier—suggesting that Lish has become the first true ""super soldier"" that the government was trying to develop 93 years ago.

The group return to Theo and Maus at the farmstead, where the baby, named Caleb, has been born safely but they relay a strange story about being attacked by a viral and neither remembering killing it, though it has a shotgun blast through its chest. Peter and Lish realize the dead viral is actually Maus's husband, Galen Strauss who was turned since she left the Colony and either sought her out or just happened upon them at the farm. The friends stay for a while, making sure Theo and family have enough food stocked since Theo's leg was broken during the fight with the viral. The group begins discussing the idea of using the rest of the modified serum to raise more super soldiers to fight Zero, but Amy throws them all into the fire, citing concerns about sharing her miserable curse with other people and losing humanity. The next day the main group departs on foot, heading back to the First Colony, while Theo and his family, along with Hollis and Sara in the 
Humvee
, head off to Kerrville.

Amy, Peter, Michael, Greer and Lish, after months of walking, return to the First Colony only to find it deserted, with no sign of what happened or where the colonists may have gone.  There are two bodies, a victim of a suicide and that of Auntie, who seemingly died of old age. They decide to hunt down the remaining Twelve using Lear's files to determine their locations, and Lish as their primary weapon.  That night Amy meets the infected Wolgast, outside the Colony.

The other group is able to meet up with the Texan Expeditionary force, and their remaining story is related through parts of Sara's diary—her last entry is at Roswell Base, and among comments about her own pregnancy she states that she can hear gunshots, and is going to investigate.  This entry is presented as part of the future reference material, and is stated to have come from the site of ""The Roswell Massacre"".  The novel ends ambiguously for all surviving characters."

The Gentleman Bastards are masters of deception, disguise, and fine cuisine. Father Chains, their ""garrista"" leader, is a priest of the Crooked Warden, the god of thieves. He buys troublesome youth Locke for his gang. Through a series of 
confidence tricks
 on the rich, they defy the Secret Peace, an unspoken agreement between the criminal underground and the Duke's government which allows for the existence of organized crime with the understanding that the 
peerage
 and the servants of justice are off limits. After Chains' death, Locke becomes garrista of the group, consisting of Jean Tannen, an expert fighter; Calo and Galdo Sanza, jack-of-all-trades identical twins; Bug, a young apprentice; and Sabetha, a master charmer who resides elsewhere during the events of the novel.

The criminal underworld of Camorr is ruled with an iron fist by the Capa Barsavi, who collects a commission on all criminal activity under his purview. Under Locke's leadership, the Gentleman Bastards are known as a small gang of gentrified but petty thieves and pickpockets, and their dues, though regularly paid, are relatively small. Secretly, the Bastards have actually been using elaborate schemes to swindle various nobles out of large sums, and have amassed a considerable fortune; they 
purchase
 the trinkets they pass on to Barsavi as tribute, in accordance with their small-time reputation. What little is spoken of their operations is credited to the shadowy ""Thorn of Camorr.""

Locke pretends to be Lukas Fehrwight, a merchant from Emberlain,
[

]
 to con Don Lorenzo Salvara and his wife. Meanwhile, a mysterious criminal calling himself the Gray King has been killing Barsavi's most trusted garristas; fearing for his safety, Barsavi has sequestered himself in his ship-fortress, the Floating Grave. Locke finds himself face to face with the Gray King and his hired Bondsmage ""The Falconer"", who somehow know what the Gentleman Bastards have been up to; Locke agrees to impersonate the Gray King in an arranged meeting with Barsavi in exchange for the Gray King's silence, as well as the Bondsmage's magical protection from Barsavi's wrath during the meeting. The Gray King murders Barsavi's daughter Nazca and delivers her body to the Capa in a barrel of horse urine; Locke is forced to continue with the plan, even though he knows that now Barsavi will never negotiate.

At the meeting, Barsavi manages to circumvent a disguised Locke's magical protection, having him severely beaten and left to drown in a barrel. Jean and Bug save him, but they realize that the Gray King has double-crossed them; they return to their secret lair and find their wealth stolen and the Sanza twins brutally murdered. An intruder kills Bug and nearly Jean and Locke, who swear revenge. Locke goes to the Floating Grave in disguise, where Barsavi is celebrating the Gray King's supposed death. Suddenly two of Barsavi's trusted bodyguards, the fierce Berengias sisters, turn on him and cut down Barsavi and his two sons. The Gray King whom Locke deduces is the brother of the Berengias twins appears, introduces himself as Capa Raza and claims Barsavi's empire as his own.

Left without resources and needing funds to somehow strike back at Raza, Locke tries to complete the con against the Salvaras. Meanwhile, Jean investigates the after-dark activity of Raza's minions and realizes that the new Capa is secretly loading his newfound wealth onto a ship supposedly quarantined for plague. Before Jean can tell Locke, he is ambushed by the Berengias sisters. He manages to kill both, but is seriously wounded himself. The Duke's ""Spider"", Camorr's secret spymaster who is actually the elderly Doña Vorchenza, has learned that the Salvaras are being conned by the mysterious ""Thorn of Camorr."" She and the Salvaras lure Locke to the Duke's annual celebration, and he barely escapes. Returning to their hideout, Locke finds Jean incapacitated by the Bondsmage's sorcery, which relies on the use of Jean's true name. Locke, whose real name is not known, overpowers the Falconer and tortures him for information. Wary of revenge by other Bondsmages should he be killed, Jean and Locke remove his fingers and tongue so he cannot gesture or speak spells, leaving him alive but insane.

Capa Raza has planned his revenge against Barsavi and the nobles of Camorr since childhood, when his parents were murdered as collateral damage from the Secret Peace. To destroy the peers, he gives the Duke of Camorr four sculptures, actually 
time bombs
 filled with a substance that will cause all of the nobles and their children present at the celebration to slide into permanent mindlessness. Locke races back to the tower from which he escaped and manages to convince Vorchenza and the Salvaras of the danger, and the devices are defused. He next coerces the Spider to set him free to kill Raza, and not put him on trial for theft as a reward for saving their lives. Vorchenza agrees when Locke has shared the location of the stolen money; he tells her that Raza has hidden his treasure on a waste barge, and instructs her to destroy the plague ship and its crew before Raza can use it to infect the city. Locke faces Raza in mortal combat even though he is outmatched by the Capa's skills with a sword, and is nearly killed before managing to distract Raza for the split second he needs to finally slay him. When no treasure is found on the barge, Vorchenza realizes that the Thorn tricked her into destroying the ship filled with Raza's fortune, which is now an offering to the god of thieves for Locke's murdered friends. Later, Jean and Locke, recovering from their injuries, sail away to a new life.

The plot involves 24th-century entrepreneur-tycoon-scientist Simeon Krug, who has created a race of 
androids
 to serve 
humanity
. Krug directs the construction of an immense tower of glass in the Canadian 
tundra
. The edifice is not a monument, however, but a way to communicate with a distant 
planetary nebula
, 
NGC 7293
, from which an intelligent (though indecipherable) message has been received. Krug is also building a 
starship
 to send there, which is to be crewed by androids in 
hibernation
.

The tower construction is directed by Krug's most faithful android, Alpha Thor Watchman. Thor and other leading androids have invented a secret religion for androids, based on the vision that their creator, Krug, intends to eventually make them equal to humans. Krug is unaware of the religion. Thor's dream is to convince him through indirect means, including the manipulation of his weak-willed son and heir, Manuel, through a sexual relationship with a female android, Alpha Lilith Meson. Thor eventually falls in love with her, as does Manuel.

After Thor and Lilith have manipulated Manuel into telling his father about the android religion, Krug insists that the minds of him and Thor be connected in the ""shunt room"" which allows one mind to probe another's
[

]
 (a form of 
technologically enabled telepathy
). Thor discovers via the link that Krug regards androids as mere things, and has no intention of treating them as equal to womb-born humans. Realizing that Krug will never give freedom to androids, Thor loses his faith and announces Krug's true nature to androids worldwide.  With the collapse of their religion, androids across all of Earth rebel.  Many walk off their jobs, others take control of key Earth installations, and some even kill humans in their long-suppressed rage. Thor then causes the fall of the nearly-complete, 1,200-metre-tall (3,900 ft) tower.

An enraged Krug attacks Thor; the latter, unable to fight his creator, is pushed into an unprogrammed 
teleporter
 and annihilated. Krug, his empire destroyed and humanity in grave danger, flees in his starship, alone, towards the star system from which the alien message was sent.

Sarah, now 87, is tasked to decode the second message sent from the unknown alien race—if she can live long enough to do so. A wealthy industrial billionaire, Cody McGavin, offers to put up billions of dollars to perform a ""rollback"" on not only Sarah but Don as well. This process, which reverts a person's body to its condition when the subject was 25 years old, is successfully performed on Don, but fails to work with Sarah. This leaves Sarah gradually creeping toward death while Don's life begins anew. Much of the story focuses on Don as he discovers the advantages and disadvantages of being young again, with periodic flashbacks to when Sarah translated the first alien message."

A Night in the Lonesome October
 is narrated from the 
point-of-view
 of Snuff, a dog who is 
Jack the Ripper
's companion. The bulk of the story takes place in 
London
 and its environments, though at one point the story detours through the dream-world described by Lovecraft in 
The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath
. Though never explicitly stated, various contextual clues within the story (the most obvious of which is the appearance of 
Sherlock Holmes
 or ""The Great Detective"") imply that it takes place during the late Victorian period.

The story reveals that once every few decades when the moon is full on the night of Halloween (a very rare ""Blue Moon"", meaning the second full moon in that month), the fabric of reality thins, and doors may be opened between this world and the realm of the 
Great Old Ones
. When these conditions are right, men and women with occult knowledge may gather at a specific ritual site to hold the doors closed, or to help fling them open. Should the Closers win, then the world will remain as it is until the next turning, but should the Openers succeed, then the Great Old Ones will come to Earth, to remake the world in their own image, enslaving or slaughtering the human race in the process. The Openers have never yet won. These meetings are often referred to as ""The Game"" or ""The Great Game"" by the participants, who try to keep the goings-on secret from the mundane population.

The various ""Players"" during the Game depicted in the book are archetypal characters from the Victorian Era 
gothic fiction
 – Jack the Ripper (only ever referred to as ""Jack""), 
Dracula
 (""The Count""), and the Wolf Man (known as ""
Larry Talbot
"", the film character's name) all make appearances. In addition, there is a 
Witch
 (""Crazy Jill""), a 
Clergyman
 (Vicar Roberts), a 
Druid
 (""Owen""), 
Victor Frankenstein
 (""The Good Doctor""), 
Sherlock Holmes
 (""The Great Detective""), a ""Mad Monk"" (""Rastov"" – apparently modeled after 
Rasputin
), and grave robbers or 
Hermetic
 occultists (""Morris and McCab"" – based either on real-life 
grave robbers Burke and Hare

Each Player has a 
familiar
 – an animal companion with near-human intelligence that helps complete the numerous preparations for the ritual. The majority of the story describes the interactions and discussions of these familiars, all from Snuff's point of view.

Throughout the book, the Players slowly take sides, form alliances, make deals, oppose one another, and even kill off their enemies. The plot accelerates until the night of October 31, when the rite takes place and the fate of the world is decided.

The story emphasizes the various characters' reactions to the event, according to their specific scientific backgrounds. Examples include a priest's speculations on the implications for religion, a psychologist's theorizing about the aliens' psyches, the scientists' consideration of the implications of the new knowledge for their own specialties, and the president's concern for the implications for national defense.

The novel is set in an ongoing 
Cold War
 scenario. Unlike typical 
first contact
 stories, there is no dialogue between the senders of the message and mankind, as the received radio signals have traveled through space for one and a half million years.



The extraterrestrial message

The message is received with a large 
radio telescope
, the fictional Hercules Array, which was built on the 
far side of the Moon
. It is later discovered that the message was sent with an artificial 
pulsar
 built by the alien race. This pulsar with the name 
Althea
 has been known by the scientists for years. It was believed to be a normal pulsar. However, what made it special was its almost perfectly regular interval between the observed pulses.

One day, some of the pulses suddenly fail to appear. This incident draws more attention to this particular pulsar, as the newly discovered gaps show a remarkable pattern.

The first gap consists of one missing pulse, the second of two missing pulses and the third gap consists of four missing pulses. The following gaps also consist of numbers representing 
powers of 2
 (2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, ...). The transmission of these numbers goes on for a couple of days until the pulsar falls completely silent.

The silence lasts for several weeks, until it breaks again. This time, not just a simple sequence of numbers is received by the Hercules Array. Now, a very large and complex amount of binary data is sent from somewhere close to Althea. Scientists are able to decipher this data. It consists of several mathematical and physical formulae and simple graphical information. Later, more complex information is found, e.g., parts of the sender's 
DNA
, schematics for very advanced technology, philosophical texts or poems."

The novel begins sometime in the near-future in a small town in rural America. Flynne Fisher works at a local 3D printing shop and lives with her mother and her brother Burton, who sustained brain trauma from 
cybernetic
 implants he received while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps' elite 
Haptic
 Recon unit. When Burton heads to another town to counter-protest the protests of a religious extremist group known as Luke 4:5, he asks her to take over his job working security in a video game/virtual world for a supposedly Colombian company called Milagros Coldiron. Flynne takes the job and notices the game world looks suspiciously like London, but far more empty and more futuristic. Piloting a security 
quadcopter
, she fends off 
paparazzi
 drones from an unknown woman's high-rise apartment. On the second night of doing so she witnesses a man and a woman out on a balcony, where the woman is apparently killed and gruesomely devoured by a swarm of 
nanobots
; Flynne is uncertain whether this is real or part of a virtual game.

The novel alternates between Flynne's experiences and those of Wilf Netherton, a publicist who lives in the early 22nd century, seventy years later than Flynne's time, and several decades after an apocalyptic period known as the Jackpot took place. As the book begins, Wilf is working with Daedra West, an American artist/celebrity/diplomat, on establishing relations with a group of deformed native humans known as ""Patchers,"" on an enormous cultivated

Lev, the son of a powerful and wealthy Russian family that moved to Britain several generations ago, is a ""continua enthusiast."" He has introduced Wilf to ""stubs"" which are alternate pasts whose futures begin to deviate from the ones that lead to his and Wilf's present at the moment contact is made from their present - a contact only possible in a data sense and only made possible by a mysterious quantum computer running in China. Milagros Coldiron is Zubov's front organization for accessing the stub in which Flynne and Burton live. Inhabitants of Flynne's time are able to access the early 22nd century of Zubov and Netherton via headsets built using a 3D printer and technological know-how passed back to them from the 22nd century.  These headsets allow the wearer's consciousness to inhabit and control a 'peripheral' a.k.a. an artificial physical human body in the 22nd century.  Using this technology, Wilf had hired Burton Fisher from his stub to act as drone security for Daedra's sister, Aelita, as a novelty gift to her.

When Aelita goes missing, Wilf realizes that the drones controlled by Flynne were the only witness of the event while all other recording devices were disabled.

Returning from his trip, Burton tells Flynne that Milagros Coldiron wants to speak with her. Via a video call, she tells Wilf and the others about what she saw on the tower, but Wilf is reluctant to tell her that the murder was not part of a game. He does tell Flynne that an assassination contract has been put out on Burton, on their timeline, using the darknet. Burton responds by getting his military colleagues to set up a perimeter around their house. Shortly after, his friend Conner, a triple amputee who uses a motorized, road-capable wheelchair, kills four armed men in a car heading up the country road to their house, using a mentally-controlled gun rig. Milagros Coldiron begins using their advanced technology and foreknowledge to build financial and political power in the past.

Wilf, Lev, and their allies in the further future are visited by Inspector Ainsley Lowbeer, investigating Aelita's disappearance. When they tell her what Flynne told them, she insists that Flynne be brought to the future via a peripheral (a cyborg avatar that users can connect to from another location) via the quantum server so that Flynne can identify the man who was present when Aelita died, to help solve the case. Lev and his assistants Ash and Ossian send back 3D printing instructions for a peripheral-controlling headset, which Flynne's computer-savvy friends Macon and Edward use to create a connectivity headband for her called ""the crown"". She connects to a peripheral that has been brought to Lev's house, where Wilf explains that this is really the future, albeit not one possible for her now that her timeline has been altered.

Lowbeer notices that Daedra is holding a new party at her sister's apartment, and she gets Wilf to get himself and Flynne's peripheral invited, with Wilf pretending that the peripheral will be controlled by a woman who studies neoprimitive art and is a huge fan of Daedra's work. Deciding they might need extra muscle to confront Daedra, Wilf's group recruits Conner to manufacture another crown and control another peripheral, a bodyguard for Wilf at the party; Conner is ecstatic at being able to walk again while piloting a peripheral. Meanwhile, back in the 21st century, a second group of assassins is killed by Burton's military colleagues. Milagros Coldiron attempts to ""buy"" the state governor, who, like most officials of the time, is corrupt, to avoid a police investigation. Burton's group use Milagros Coldiron's money and connections to build a secure base and acquire military equipment. Flynne is kidnapped by one of Burton's colleagues under blackmail by a local drug baron named Corbell Pickett. Pickett explains that the people who killed Aelita are operating a corporate collective called Matryoshka with the goal of killing Flynne, and Pickett is negotiating a higher reward before executing her. She is rescued by Burton and Conner, who kill Pickett’s security guards and destroy his compound. Wilf's crew in the future make her, Burton, and their friends executives of Coldiron USA, which is now battling economically and politically against Matryoshka around the globe, and declares their base the corporate headquarters.

Wilf reveals that the Jackpot begins in the middle of the 21st century as a combination of climate change and other causes, followed by a series of droughts, famines, pandemics, political chaos, and anarchy. 80% of the global human population dies off. But as this is going on, scientists have created nanotech called Assemblers that begins to rebuild society, as well as finding other scientific and engineering breakthroughs. As a result, everything is very efficient and advanced in Wilf's future, but it has mostly empty cities and most natural animal species are 
extinct
.

Wilf, Flynne and Conner (the latter two in their peripherals) go to Daedra's party, which has become a celebration of Aelita's life. Flynne spots the man who killed Aelita, but he and Daedra kidnap them, revealing themselves to be behind the plot to kill Flynne. Conner's peripheral is destroyed while trying to kill the kidnappers. The man who was present when Aelita was killed is revealed to be Hamed al-Habib, who had been ""killed"" by Daedra as a peripheral that day on the garbage patch, and had undergone surgery to revert himself to a more normal human form long ago. Daedra and Hamed have conspired with a city official named Sir Henry, who holds the position of 
remembrancer
, to exterminate the patchers and sell their resources to profit themselves. Aelita was killed for reasons not entirely clear, most likely because Hamed and Daedra feared she was going to sell them out.

Conner (operating a robotic weapon designed in another stub under Lowbeer's influence) and Burton (operating a peripheral-like exoskeleton) break into the room where Flynne and Wilf are being held. Flynne and Burton fire special weapons that direct Assembler nanobots, and both Hamed and Sir Henry are eaten down to the bone by the machines; Daedra is temporarily detained but is released after interrogation. In Flynne's world Matryoshka becomes completely inoperative and Milagros Coldiron gains uncontested power.

Years later, Flynne winds up married to the police officer she had long been interested in; her brother and their friends find love as well. Conner receives a set of bionic limbs constructed from plans sent from the future. Wilf finds love with his former coworker from Canada, with whom he moves in. He and Flynne still connect back and forth between timelines to see each other; Flynne meets weekly with Lowbeer (via peripheral) to discuss the changes to Flynne's world that are being made through the funding of Milagros Coldiron in an attempt to avert the Jackpot."

Aside from such rumors, their real-life existence has been kept secret by governments around the world, who formed KPS (the Kaiju Preservation Society) to study the Kaiju Earth, prevent additional breakthroughs, and protect the denizens of each world from those of the other.

Kaiju Earth is a torrid world, high in oxygen and radioactive volatiles, dominated by Kaiju and teeming with lesser predators. Sent to Tanaka Base, an outpost in the Kaiju Earth version of 
Labrador
, Jamie supports the scientific staff studying the biota there, particularly the Kaiju ""Bella,"" a brooding mother laying her eggs at the irradiated site of the death of another Kaiju, whose internal atomic pile overheated and exploded—a not infrequent occurrence. Unfortunately, this event weakened the barrier between worlds, and Bella planting herself at the very location the event occurred is keeping the barrier from rehealing. A predatory corporation on the Human Earth side (coincidentally led by Jamie's old boss Rob Sanders), in on the Kaiju secret, takes the opportunity to breach the barrier and move the Kaiju mother and her eggs to the Human side. Jamie and the other KPS team members must somehow cross over themselves and recover Bella, both to preserve the Kaiju secret and protect both worlds from catastrophe."

Twenty years in the past, merchanter ships 
Sprite
 and 
Corinthian
 were docked at Mariner Station. What started out as a friendly sleepover between the inexperienced Marie Hawkins of 
Sprite
 and Austin Bowe of 
Corinthian
 turned into rape, with Marie becoming pregnant. She elected to raise the child, Thomas Bowe-Hawkins, on 
Sprite
, but was consumed with rage. Her brother was the senior captain of 
Sprite
. Tom grew up with an ambivalent mother and was never fully accepted by his family. When Austin later became senior captain of 
Corinthian
, Marie started tracking 
Corinthian's
 movements in order to expose what she suspected was

When the two ships cross paths again, this time at Viking, Marie initiates her long-planned revenge. She and Tom scour the docks for information about 
Corinthian

Corinthian

Sprite
 pursues. Aboard 
Corinthian
, Tom meets Austin, his domineering father, and Capella, second chief navigator and 
night-walker
.

When 
Corinthian
 docks at Pell Station, Tom's younger half-brother, Christian Bowe-Perrault, tries to solve the problem by shipping him off to Sol Station, but Tom escapes and hides on the docks. Christian and Capella search frantically for him, unaware that Sabrina Perrault-Cadiz, Christian's cousin, has already found and befriended him. When Capella contacts old acquaintances for assistance, it attracts the unwanted attention of a dissident faction within the outlawed 
Mazianni Fleet
. Capella is an ex-Fleet navigator with knowledge of Fleet routes and drop-points, which the dissidents want.

When 
Corinthian
 prepares to depart for Tripoint, Tom returns voluntarily to the ship and is no longer treated as a prisoner. He learns the ship's secret: they are illegally trading with the renegade Fleet. Austin justifies this by maintaining that supplying the Fleet means it will not have to raid merchanter ships.

Sprite
 arrives at Pell Station shortly after 
Corinthian

 immediately starts frantically offloading to the freighter, a Fleet drop-point. As the spotter and 
Sprite
 approach, Tom and Christian activate the freighter's weapons and destroy the spotter.

Tom tells his mother he is staying with 
Corinthian
 because he is more at home on his father's ship than his mother's. Marie, having taken the captaincy of 
Sprite
 from her weak brother, does not expose Corinthian's illegal trade because of Tom and because 
Corinthian

The Parijatdvipan Empire rules over several vassal states, including Ahiranya. Ahiranya’s native language, religion, and culture have been suppressed; this has led to instability and rebellion. A new disease called the rot, which causes plants to sprout from one's body, is leading to further stress.

Within an Ahiranyi temple called the Hirana, there is a source of power known as the deathless waters. By passing through the waters once, twice, or thrice, Ahiranyi temple children risked their lives in exchange for gaining magical powers related to the 
yaksa
, nature spirits. During the Parijati conquest, some of the Ahiranyi elders betrayed their companions; most of the elders and temple children were massacred.

Prince Aditya leaves the traditional Parijati religion to become a priest of the nameless god, a religion belonging to the region of Alor. His brother Chandra ascends to the throne. Chandra is a religious fanatic and attempts to impose his beliefs on the empire. Malini, Emperor Chandra’s sister, refuses to sacrifice herself in a religious ritual and is exiled. A group of dissidents, led by Prince Rao of Alor, attempts to free Malini and place Aditya on the throne.

Malini is imprisoned in the Hirana. Priya is a former temple child who survived the massacre. She is a servant in the household of General Vikram, the Parijati Regent of Ahiranya, and his wife Bhumika. Priya saves Malini from an assassination attempt and becomes her personal maid.

Ashok, the leader of a group of resistance fighters, is Priya’s older brother and another surviving temple child. He and his rebels hope to violently overthrow the occupying government. Ashok and his rebels drink their last supply from the deathless waters; they gain powers, but will die if they cannot replenish their store from the Hirana. Bhumika reveals herself as a surviving temple child and has Vikram executed, consolidating power for herself.

In exchange for independence for Ahiranya, Priya agrees to help Malini escape. Before they flee the Hirana, Priya seals the path to the deathless waters so that Ashok cannot reach them. Malini and Priya flee toward the city-state of Srugna and begin a romance. Bhumika, Priya, and Malini meet with Rao and Aditya. Priya agrees to save Ashok and his rebels on the condition that they recognize Bhumika as leader. Malini remains with her brother as the others return to Ahiranya.

Priya’s group returns to the Hirana. She and Bhumika become thrice-born, but Ashok dies in the attempt. Bhumika and Priya become elders, reinstating the traditional Ahiranyi religion.

Emperor Chandra sends a battalion to attack Aditya. The weak-willed Aditya is unwilling to sacrifice his soldiers, but Malini takes control, burning the temple of the nameless god to the ground. This kills all of Chandra’s soldiers, as well as some of Aditya’s priests. Malini claims power and is proclaimed as Empress."

Decades ago, Earth was destroyed and fourteen billion humans died during the Majo War. The majo are a group of several alien species. Most surviving humans integrate into majo society, but a few humans survive on the separatist Gaea Station.

Valkyrie “Kyr” is a human living on Gaea, which is ruled by Commander Aulus Jole. Adults on Gaea are assigned to either combat, workforce, or breeding roles. Despite her amazing scores in combat, Kyr is assigned to Nursery, where she is expected to produce future warriors. Her twin brother Magnus is assigned to combat, but he refuses his assignment and leaves the station. She and Mags’s friend Avi hack into Command’s files. They find that Magnus has actually been assigned a secret suicide mission.

The majo are led by a supercomputer known as the Wisdom. The Wisdom decides what is in the best interests of the majo, directing their society. It is so powerful that it can warp reality itself. The planet Chrysothemis will soon activate its Wisdom Node, integrating it into the Wisdom network. Magnus has been assigned to attack Chrysothemis during this event. Kyr, Avi, and a majo prisoner named Yiso escape Gaea and reach Chrysothemis. She reunites with her older sister Ursa, who fled Gaea after being raped and impregnated by Jole. Ursa tries to convince Kyr to enter a de-radicalization program, but Kyr runs away, planning to destroy the Wisdom Node herself.

She reaches the node and is met by Avi, Magnus, and Yiso. Avi decides that instead of destroying the Wisdom Node, they will use its powers to win the war for humanity. Avi takes control of the Wisdom and uses it to destroy millions of planets as revenge for the destruction of Earth. Kyr tries to stop him, but fails. Magnus commits suicide. Kyr kills Avi.

The Wisdom speaks to Kyr and sends her back in time to Doomsday, when the majo destroyed Earth. Kyr saves Earth and causes humans to win the Majo War.

In this new reality, a woman named Val has a brother named Max. Val is a member of the Terran Expeditionary Force, while her brother is working with a pro-majo insurgency. In this reality, Yiso finds Val and uses the Wisdom to share Kyr’s memories with her. The combined Val-Kyr personality then has the memories from both lives. Yiso tells Valkyr that in this new reality, Jole personally took control of the Wisdom after the Majo War. Valkyr, Max, and Yiso decide to confront Jole and destroy the Wisdom. Yiso sets the Wisdom to destroy itself. Enraged, Jole uses the power of the dying Wisdom to destroy thousands of majo-inhabited worlds. The Wisdom speaks to Valkyr and sends her back to the original timeline once again.

Kyr arrives in the original timeline just before she would have been assigned to Nursery. The Wisdom destroys itself, rocking the majo civilization and upending Jole’s plans. Jole assigns Kyr to Command and begins preparing to invade Chrysothemis. Kyr and a group of conspirators including Magnus, Avi, and Yiso plan to steal a dreadnought and free all of Gaea’s women and children.

Martin Seymour is an Australian news correspondent in 
Iran
 covering the 2012 Iranian parliamentary elections. The elections turn out to be a sham as many of the opposition candidates are banned, but Martin remains in Iran to cover the post election protests. Unrest escalates and the authorities are forced to hold free elections.

Nasim Golestani is an Iranian computer scientist living in exile in the United States following the execution of her father by 
VEVAK
,  the Iranian secret police. She works at 
MIT
 on the 
Human Connectome Project
 (HCP), which is attempting to produce a neural map of the human brain. She develops computer software that simulates 
zebra finch
 song production by using thousands of finch brain scans. But when Congress turns down funding for the project, Nasim returns to Iran to help rebuild her country.

The story moves to a democratized Iran in 2027. Martin lives in 
Tehran
 with Mahnoosh, an Iranian political activist he married, and their six-year-old son, Javeed. Nasim heads a company in Tehran that has developed Zendegi-ye Behtar, an online multi-player 
virtual reality
 (VR) gaming platform. Zendegi uses 
cloud computing
 to run its operations across several countries. But Zendegi has to compete with several other VR providers, and Nasim looks for something new to add to Zendegi to give it an edge.

Nasim learns that HCP finally took off in the US and has published its first draft brain map based on thousands of brain scans of human 
organ donors
. She discovers that her contributions were not used by the project – HCP's goals were aimed at helping 
neurologists
 diagnose 
pathologies
, whereas her goal was to simulate the brain. Nasim decides to continue what she had started on HCP using the project's publicly available brain scans. Her goal is to improve the realism of Zendegi's proxies, computer-generated people that flesh-out the VR's landscape. She takes this a step further and starts taking 
MRI
 brain scans of living people. Nasim's first breakthrough comes with Virtual Azimi, a proxy she creates by scanning Ashkan Azimi, Iran's national 
football
 team captain, to record his 
motor skills
 while he replays games in his head. Virtual Azimi enables football fans to play games with Azimi's proxy, and it is a huge success, boosting Zendegi's popularity.

Javeed loves Zendegi and Martin often takes him to local gaming booths where together they participate in 
role-playing games
. One day Mahnoosh is killed in a car accident, and Martin has to raise Javeed on his own. Then Martin discovers he has terminal cancer, and concerned that Javeed will grow up without a father, he contacts Nasim and asks her to create a Virtual Martin that Javeed can communicate with in Zendegi. Nasim conducts MRI scans on Martin while prompting him with images and memories. But Zendegi comes under fire from religious fanatics. Iranian clerics denounce Virtual Azimi as ""an afront to God and human dignity"".

 It is also criticized by the Cis-Humanist League (CHL), a human rights group who object to enslaved proxies, saying that ""it's unethical to create conscious software that lacks the ability to control its own destiny"".

Nasim continues developing Virtual Martin in secret. While she knows that Virtual Azimi has no consciousnesses, she is not sure what Martin's proxy is turning into. Meanwhile, Martin's health is deteriorating and she sets up a VR session for him to evaluate the current state of his proxy. Martin enters Zendegi using Javeed's 
avatar
, making Virtual Martin think he is talking to his son, but the proxy overreacts to Javeed's (Martin's) behaviour and this upsets Martin. After Martin dies, Nasim has second thoughts about what she is doing. The Virtual Martin she has created  from fragments of Martin's brain is far from human. She realises that CHL are right: to upload a complete person into VR to achieve immortality is a noble goal, but ""to squeeze some abridged, mutilated person through the first available aperture [i]s not"".

. Such resources are useless for any other purpose, and are therefore economically free to us. And so we colonize, and build.""

The 
self-replicating spacecraft
 are named 
Gaijin
 (Japanese for ""foreigner""), after their discovery by a Japanese observer on the Moon.  Malenfant travels in a prototype fusion engine to the Kirkwood Gap and discovers an interstellar teleportation device. He travels around the galaxy to uncover information about the Fermi paradox (see below). At the same time, the story also follows the efforts of Humans on Earth and the eventual draining of the Earth's resources, making a move off-world necessary.  At the same time a small group of humans use 
anti-aging
 techniques and an alien form of interstellar 
teleportation
[
a
]
 to ""parachute"" in on the changing solar system over many centuries.

Eventually, it is revealed that in this version of the 
Fermi paradox
, 
sentient
 life is endemic throughout the universe; Humanity simply had not noticed it earlier because the universe destroys any race before it becomes advanced enough to develop a 
Type IV civilisation
.  The story ends with Malenfant helping the Gaijin build a shield to prevent a 
pulsar
 from sterilising a large part of the galaxy. Although this project will not be completed before another predicted pulsar event wipes out all extant species, it is hoped to give the sentient aliens who develop from the aftermath of the coming extinction a better chance at long-term survival.

Set in 2030–2031, ten years after the events of 
Software
, 
Wetware
 focuses on the attempt of an 
Edgar Allan Poe
-obsessed bopper named Berenice to populate Earth with a robot/human hybrid called a 
meatbop
. Toward this end, she implants an embryo in a human woman living on the Moon (Della Taze, Cobb Anderson's niece) and then frames her for murder to force her to return to Earth. After only a few days, she gives birth to a boy named Manchile, who has been genetically programmed to carry bopper software in his brain (and in his sperm), and to grow to maturity in a matter of weeks.

Berenice's plan is for Manchile to announce the formation of a new religion unifying boppers and humans, and then arrange to have himself assassinated. (Rucker makes several allusions to the 
Christ
 story; Taze's abbreviated pregnancy is discovered on Christmas Eve, for instance.) Before the assassination, Manchile impregnates several women, the idea being that his similarly accelerated offspring will create a race of meatbops at an exponential rate.

The plot goes disastrously awry, and a human corporation called ISDN retaliates against the boppers by infecting them with a genetically modified organism called chipmold. The artificial disease succeeds in killing off the boppers, but when it infects the boppers' outer coating, a kind of smart plastic known as flickercladding, it creates a new race of intelligent 
symbiotes
 known as 
moldies
 — thus fulfilling Berenice's dream of an organic/synthetic hybrid.

Both of the two main human characters of 
Software
 play prominent roles in 
Wetware
: Cobb Anderson, whose robot body was destroyed at the end of the last novel, has his software implanted in a new body so he can help raise Manchile; while Sta-Hi Mooney—now known as Stahn Mooney—is now working as a private detective on the Moon after accidentally killing his wife, and is used as a pawn in various bopper and anti-bopper schemes.

The 
Belle of Louisville

Louisville, Kentucky
 (the setting for the earthbound portions of the book), occurs as a character in the book, in which it is revealed that the steamer has been imbued with an onboard

Peter Leigh, an English pastor, decides to leave his wife Beatrice in order to be a missionary. It is gradually revealed that rather than being a missionary in a different country, he has been hired by USIC, a private American corporation, to preach to the population of a distant planet, Oasis. Peter expects to find hostility when meeting the natives, but he finds instead that they are extremely welcoming, already speak English very well and are passionate devotees of the Christian faith, referring to themselves as Jesus Lover One, Two, et cetera. Peter sets to work trying to build a church for the Jesus Lovers and trying to live amongst them. 

On his brief trips back to the base camp where the engineers and scientist who run USIC on Oasis live, he tries to contact Bea using a Shoot, a message system which allows him to communicate back on Earth. Though Bea's initial messages are full of love, they also include information on severe natural disasters caused by 
climate change
, including flooding and famine that have happened since Peter left. After a few months, she also informs Peter that she is pregnant with his child, conceived on the last night he was with her. Peter, whose life is full with his missionary work, feels distant from Bea and begins to find it difficult to recall her face and their life together, instead focusing on integrating himself into the Oasan community. 

While helping the Oasans with a harvest, which they trade with the USIC population for medicine, Peter receives a terrible bite from an Oasan pest. The community is horrified and treat him as though he is dying. Peter believes he has been poisoned, but nevertheless he goes back to USIC, where he is treated for his wounds and receives a message from Bea telling him that there is no God. In distress, Peter decides to go back to the Oasan village in order to die, but he accidentally finds the village they abandoned before he arrived, where he meets the linguist that was his predecessor. The linguist warns him that the USIC workers are not as harmonious as they appear and that Earth is dying. 

The following day, he is retrieved by Grainger, the USIC pharmacist with whom he is closest. Grainger implies Peter may have been hallucinating as he was severely dehydrated. Back at the USIC base camp, he learns that his favorite Oasan, Jesus Lover Five, has come to the base camp seeking treatment, as a fallen painting which bruised her hand has led to her dying. Peter realizes with horror that the reason Oasans have embraced Jesus so much is because they are terribly vulnerable to injury and death, and they take the tales of healing miracles, Heaven and Jesus rising from the grave literally.

Based on Bea's attitude and the fact that he has unintentionally deceived the Oasans, Peter decides to return to Earth. He visits the Oasan town once more where his congregation, who last saw him receiving severe injuries, treat his return as a miracle. As a parting gift to them, he tries to explain that humans are capable of recovering from injuries in a way the Oasans are not, but they remain faithful Christians nevertheless. Before he leaves for Earth, Peter receives a last message from Bea which tells him to stay where he is, as she has to relocate and Earth is unsafe. However, Peter is resolved to return to her and their unborn child and remain with them even until the end of the world."

Atticus Turner, working in Florida after leaving the army, returns home to Chicago after receiving a mysterious letter from his estranged father, Montrose, saying he had left Chicago to go to Ardham, Massachusetts, where he believed he could find some information on Atticus's mother's family (previously unknown to them). Atticus, his uncle George, and his childhood friend Letitia drive to Ardham to find Montrose. They are chased, accosted, and later nearly murdered by racists on the way.

Once at Ardham they find a large manor house called Ardham Lodge. Atticus learns that he is the descendant of the Lodge's founder, Titus Braithwhite. Montrose is being held hostage, chained up in a basement. The current owner of the house, Samuel Braithwhite, is planning a ceremony with all of the members of his lodge (a sect of sorcerers called ""The Order of the Ancient Dawn"") during which he needs a Braithwhite descendant to be a conduit for some ancient power. Presumably this will kill Atticus. Caleb Braithwhite (Samuel's only son) is also in attendance and he secretly provides Atticus with an incantation to say during the ceremony. Atticus does this and it causes the unleashed power to consume Samuel and all the members of the lodge and turn them into dust while protecting Atticus.

Caleb releases Atticus, George, Montrose and Letitia and lets them leave to go back to Chicago.



Dreams of the Which House
[
edit
]


Letitia receives an inheritance from her late mother, and uses it to buy, in a white neighborhood, a large 14-bedroom house called the Winthrop House (named after the original owner, Hiram Winthrop) which was being sold cheap due to it being haunted. Letitia plans on fixing it up and renting out the rooms. After moving in, she realizes that the house is haunted by Winthrop's ghost who is not too happy about sharing it with new residents. He and Letitia struggle and he nearly kills her until she convinces him that if he does she will stay as a ghost and haunt him back. After that, they come to an agreement and even find some peace over their shared love of playing games like chess. Letitia never sees Winthrop, but his pieces move on their own.

Meanwhile the white folks in the neighborhood quickly begin harassing Letitia because they don't want black people living there. They swear at her, vandalize the car of one of her friends, threaten her, and throw manure at her front door. One night, three young men break in with intentions to burn the house down. Winthrop's ghost intervenes, and hauls the men down to the basement where they are locked in terror until the police arrive.

Later, Atticus discovers that Caleb Braithwhite arranged for the sale of the house to Letitia.



Abdullah's Book
[

Caleb Braithwhite blackmails George and Montrose to break into the natural history museum and retrieve a secret book, hidden behind magical incantations set to protect it. They bring along three members of the 
Prince Hall Freemasons
 (a lodge George and Montrose belong to) for help: Abdullah Muhammad, Pirate Joe, and Mortimer Dupree. Mortimer nearly dies during the attempt, but the men are able to retrieve the book. Caleb honors his deal with the men. It's the ""Book of Names"", once owned by Hiram Winthrop. He delivers to them the book he stole from them along with a sizable amount of money.



Hippolyta Disturbs the Universe
[
edit
]


Hippolyta, the wife of Uncle George, is traveling through Wisconsin doing research for their travel guide and stops to explore an astronomical observatory that used to be owned by Hiram Winthrop. She has always dreamed of being an astronomer, even as a child. Using a code that she found in Winthrop's house at a housewarming party thrown by Letitia, she accidentally opens a portal inside the observatory that leads to another planet.

Hippolyta goes through the portal and begins to explore the other planet, finding a woman named Ida living inside a small, gated cottage. Ida was a former maid of Hiram Winthrop's and he brought her and several other employees here years ago after his son eloped with another maid named Pearl. Winthrop meant to scare the employees into telling him where Pearl and his son were but before he could return for them, he was killed by Samuel Braithwhite, and Ida, the last survivor, has been trapped on this other planet for years.

Ida doesn't believe that Winthrop's power was ended by his death and she decides to stay on the planet, giving Hippolyta a box containing a monster inside for her journey back. Ida hopes the monster will kill Hippolyta once she is back on Earth so Ida's location will continue to be a secret. Instead, the monster kills several white men who are hassling Hippolyta as she tries to leave the observatory. When Hippolyta arrives back in Chicago, she realizes a comic book that her son Horace drew for her is not in the car anymore.



Jekyll in Hyde Park
[
edit

Ruby (Letitia's sister) is approached by Caleb Braithwhite with a proposal. He needs someone to do odd jobs for him and also keep an eye on The Winthrop House. In return, he will give her a potion that will turn her into a beautiful red-haired white woman for a period of time. Ruby tries this and discovers it is real. She explores parts of Chicago as a white woman with freedom she never would have had as a black woman. She agrees to work for Caleb in this fashion.

One of the jobs he has her do is attend a meeting of representatives of different sorcerer lodges from around the country, in disguise as the red-head (whom Ruby has named Hillary). There Caleb proposes to each lodge that they join forces, form a sort of union between them, to share knowledge and help each other. When asked who would lead this union, he suggests that they all meet back in Chicago in a few months on Midsummer's Day for a contest. Whoever has the strongest alchemy to display to the others, gets the title of their leader.

Later, Ruby discovers that the potion is being made from the blood of a woman in a coma who Caleb keeps nearly frozen in a glass coffin in his basement. Ruby says she wants nothing more to do with him, but cannot bring herself to leave. The story ends with Caleb asking her to be sure of what she wants.



The Narrow House
[

Caleb Braithwhite asks Atticus and Montrose to find Henry Winthrop, the son of Hiram Winthrop. Henry took some of his father's books when he ran away, including his notebooks, and Caleb wants them. Atticus and Montrose embark on a journey to Aken, Illinois, where Henry is rumored to be. However, they soon find that since Henry ran off with a black woman who used to work at his father's house, they were both killed by a racist mob. At their house, Montrose meets the ghosts of Henry and his wife's family, who relive the last day of their lives every day (including the murder). Montrose finds Hiram's books, but decides to tell Caleb they found nothing there.

Cousin Horace makes an appearance in this chapter, after being approached by two detectives and Captain Lancaster. A comic book he drew was found near Hiram Winthrop's observatory, and they demand that Horace ask his mother Hippolyta about it and report back to them. Horace refuses to cooperate, so Lancaster casts a spell to prevent Horace from telling others about the situation, and to cause inanimate objects to move. Soon enough, Horace begins to notice all kinds of cartoons and photographs grinning at him, and a doll attacks him. Horace manages to use Scrabble tiles to spell out to Ruby what happened, and Ruby tells Caleb. Caleb reverses the curses, believing Lancaster thought Caleb ordered Hippolyta to snoop around the observatory. He thinks that Lancaster tried to kill Horace to punish Hippolyta for working with Caleb. Caleb devises a plan to kill Captain Lancaster.

In the 24th century, humans have spread to multiple planets. Most planets are populated by one of the three 
Splinter Cultures
: the Dorsai, military elite; the Exotics, arts and sciences; the Friendly, zealots of religious faith. A group called the Others, Splinter Culture cross-breeds, are gaining dominance over the outer planets.

Hal Mayne, an orphan who was discovered alone on an abandoned spaceship as a baby, is raised on Earth by three guardians, one from each Splinter Culture. One of the leaders of the Others, Bleys Ahrens, comes to the compound to find Hal. The three guardians are killed trying to protect Hal and he escapes to the Final Encyclopedia.

The Final Encyclopedia, which orbits Earth, contains all the knowledge of the human race. Hal's reaction at the Transit Point leads the director, Tam Olyn, to believe Hal could be his successor, but Hal insists on traveling on to Coby, a mining planet. After several years on Coby, Hal spends time on a Friendly planet, an Exotic planet, and the Dorsai planet, making connections and growing in self-knowledge along the way.

Meanwhile, the Others have been extending their dominance, leading the Splinter Cultures to recognize that they are under threat of destruction. Using the resources of the Final Encyclopedia and the partnerships he's built with members of the Splinter Cultures, Hal organizes the resistance to the Others on Earth. It is eventually revealed that Hal Mayne is in fact 
Donal Graeme

Twenty-eight years have passed since the events of 
Babylon's Ashes
,
 and no one has heard from Admiral Winston Duarte and his rogue fleet in the decades since they broke away from the Martian Congressional Republic Navy and journeyed through the Laconia gate. They have spent their time in the Laconia system building an advanced fleet using leftover technology from the Protomolecule's creators, along with the sample of the Protomolecule they 
stole
 from Fred Johnson on Tycho. Duarte uses the Protomolecule to massively extend his life, planning to become the immortal emperor of the 1,300 worlds joined by the gates.  

Meanwhile, back in the Solar System, Earth is back on its feet after the attack that crippled the planet. The crew of the aging gunship 
Rocinante
 (Holden, Naomi, Alex, Amos, Clarissa, and Bobbie) are still together, working contracts for the Transport Union, who control trade through the Slow Zone and the worlds the gates lead to. After receiving a morally dubious order to blockade trade to an entire system from union president Camina Drummer, upon returning to Medina, Holden and Naomi decide to retire and hand over the 
Rocinante's
 captaincy to Bobbie. 

The Laconians send out a message announcing the end of their self-imposed exile and send an enormous, incredibly advanced battleship, 
Heart of the Tempest,
 through their gate to capture Medina station. The battleship obliterates the railgun emplacements installed in the Slow Zone using a new magnetic weapon that can disintegrate matter at the atomic level, and easily takes control of the station.  

A Laconian navy commander, Santiago Singh, is made governor of Medina. At first, Singh tries to govern Medina station fairly, but after a failed assassination attempt he is shaken and becomes paranoid, having never been in combat before. His orders become increasingly ruthless, including creating public prisons, strictly limiting communications, and enforcing heavy curfews and censorship. Singh also fires his head of Security, drawing rebukes from his superiors. The crew of the 
Rocinante
 become part of a resistance movement on Medina station, which is headed by Saba (Drummer's husband). 

The 
Tempest
 leaves Medina to conquer the Solar System ahead of schedule, leaving a single small gunship, the 
Gathering Storm
, to defend the station while another battleship, the 
Typhoon
, is dispatched from Laconia. The 
Rocinante
 crew help the resistance with a plan to steal vital intelligence about the Laconian military and their advanced weapons. They steal Laconian encryption codes, disguising their intentions by using a carefully placed bomb as a distraction, hoping this will fool the Laconians into believing they were committing a terrorist attack and not a theft. The plan goes awry and Holden has to manually set off station alarms to maintain the distraction, which results in his capture. His intervention succeeds however and the Laconians do not realize their encryption codes have been stolen. This allows the remaining crew of the 
Rocinante
 to decrypt the station's security data, and begin to form a plan to free Holden and escape.  

In the Solar System, the 
Tempest
 decimates the combined fleets of Earth, Mars, and the Transport Union. However, when the 
Tempest
 uses its magnetic weapon, everyone in the Solar System blacks out for several minutes. The 
Tempest
 crew then discover a strange artifact that has appeared on board their ship, a sphere of the same floating matter that had destroyed the alien technology on 
Ilus
 decades before. On Medina station, Singh interrogates Holden, one of the only witnesses to the artifact on Ilus, and learns that the artifact on board the 
Tempest
 came from the same race that killed the Protomolecule builders. Realizing that Holden has a unique insight into this mysterious race, Singh has him shipped to Laconia.  

Back in the Solar System, as the 
Tempest
 crosses the asteroid belt, the entire combined fleet mounts a final stand against it, using atomic weapons that would destroy any other ship. The 
Tempest
 somehow survives the attack. Although it  does not use its magnetic weapon again, it is still able to decimate the combined fleet. After realizing that the ship cannot be stopped, Drummer surrenders, and the governments of Earth and Mars quickly follow, letting Laconia take control of the Solar System. 

On Medina, the resistance decodes the intelligence they stole and formulates a plan to evacuate as many people from the station as possible, where they will scatter through the ring gates to other colonies before the 
Typhoon
 can arrive. The plan is for Saba to release all prisoners on the station to sow chaos while the resistance takes control of the docks. Meanwhile Alex in the 
Rocinante
 will distract the 
Gathering Storm
 while a boarding team led by Bobbie and Amos take control of the Laconian gunship, allowing the other ships docked at the station to escape. Clarissa and Naomi will disable the station's sensors so that the Laconians cannot tell which gates the evacuating ships have gone through.  

Although the first part of the plan works, Naomi and Clarissa are betrayed by a double agent in the resistance, informing Singh who sets up an ambush. Clarissa uses her blackmarket adrenal gland mods to kill the ambush team of Laconian marines, but dies as a result. Bobbie leads the assault on the 
Gathering Storm
 and takes control of the ship. She is joined by the 
Rocinante
 and others and they escape the Slow Zone and go into hiding on a colony called Freehold. After the massive security failure, Singh instructs his security chief to cull the remaining population on Medina. Instead, the chief informs Singh that he has been instructed by Duarte to kill him for his failure to stamp out the resistance, and shoots him.  

In the epilogue, Holden arrives as a prisoner on Laconia. He meets Duarte, and attempts to warn him of the danger the protomolecule-destroying artifact on the 
Tempest
 poses. Duarte ignores his concerns, reveals he plans to use the Protomolecule as a weapon to rule all of humanity, and asks Holden to join him."

The Eusistocratic Republic of Finland holds their citizens' health above all else, even to an extreme measure. Men and women deemed unfit (""minus men"" and ""neuterwomen"", or ""morlocks""; as opposed to the acceptable ""mascos"" and ""femiwomen"", or ""eloi"") are not allowed to reproduce or participate fully in society. The novel follows Vera, renamed Vanna by the government, a morlock that has been raised by her grandmother, Aulikki, as an eloi to provide her more opportunities in life. This disguised morlock combats her oppression and the pain of losing her missing sister, Mira/Manna, by ingesting illegal chile peppers that she obtains with the help of her partner, Jare.

Mira, renamed Manna by the government of Finland, is a true eloi and serves as a model for Vanna's behaviors. She goes missing after marrying Harri Nissila and moving back to her childhood home of Neulapää. Harri is found guilty of her murder after her hair and blood are found in the trunk of his car, but Manna's body is never found. This leaves Vanna with a sense of unrest, which leads to her chili pepper addiction.

Jare, a former farmhand at Vanna and Manna's childhood home of Neulapää, becomes Vanna's partner in crime after discovering her true nature. He loves Vanna, and helps her obtain the chile peppers she desires, maintain her image as an innocent eloi, and tries to help find Manna after her mysterious disappearance—putting himself in danger at every juncture. As the government begins to crack down and chile pepper suppliers run dry, Jare discovers a drug ring fronting as a religious group—the Gaians.

The Gaians consist of three members: Mirko, Valtteri, Terhi. After their business takes off, Vanna and Jare get married and move back to the farm at Neulapää. The Gaians conclude that their profits would be maximized by moving their business to Neulapää to grow their own chili peppers. Although it appears the Gaians are interested in lucrative gain, their true intentions are to create a hybrid chili pepper that allows the capso to 
transcend
 their physical body, similar to 
shamanism
. This is achieved when Vanna ingests a pepper named ""The Core of the Sun"". She has an out-of-body experience where she momentarily becomes one with the world. While Vanna is transcending, Jare is out making a drug deal with a man who responded to his advertisement in the paper. The man, however, pulls a fast one on Jare, physically assaults him, and steals the pepper. Jare leaves the deal in a hurry, suspecting the man was a part of the Finnish government. He rushes back to the farm and orders everyone to leave. Upon departure, the Gaians leave Neulapää, and give Vanna one last dose of The Core of the Sun.

The story culminates when Harri is released from prison and seeks out Jare and Vanna to exact revenge for leading the authorities to him. This happens after Vanna has already ingested her last dose of The Core of the Sun, allowing her to invade Harri's thoughts and prevail against him as well as find out where her sister is. Vanna is then able to find Manna, releasing her from her physical body to join Vanna in her mind where they become Mira and Vera, together as one."

's energy to power it. Humans as the Time Traveler knows them live on the sunlit inner surface of the Sphere while the Morlocks live on the outer shell. The Time Traveler convinces Nebogipfel that he will help him understand the time travelling mechanism of the time machine if the Morlock takes him back to it.

When he thinks he is unobserved, the Time Traveler reactivates his machine and travels to 1873 to persuade his younger self to stop his research on Plattnerite. Nebogipfel, who took hold of the Time Traveler once he realized what he was doing, follows him there. As the Time Traveler attempts to persuade his younger self, whom he calls ""Moses"" to avoid confusion, to stop his research by providing Nebogipfel as proof that reality is changed by time travel, a 
tank
-like 
Juggernaut
 pulls into Moses' yard. The army personnel on board, commanded by Hilary Bond and accompanied by an older version of the Time Traveler's friend Filby, take Moses, Nebogipfel, and the Time Traveler to 
their
 1938, where 
World War I
 has stretched over twenty-four years due to the discovery of 
time travel
 which was influenced by the latter's work. Britain's major cities are all encased in Domes, and with the contributions of Austrian 
expatriate
 
Kurt Gödel
, the government hopes to win the war by altering Germany's history conclusively.

Nebogipfel explains to the Time Traveler that they've entered another future as a result of their actions in Moses' past. During another bombing raid on London by the 
Germans
, Gödel provides a vial of Plattnerite and leads them to the only escape available, a Time-Car 
prototype
. Upon hearing this and what society would be like after the war (a 
pessimistic
 view mirroring Wells' own), the Time Traveler and Nebogipfel mount the vehicle and insert the Plattnerite. Moses is killed in an explosion when he tries to save Gödel, and the Time-Car travels back to the 
Paleocene
 and is wrecked on a tree. After weeks of bare survival, the Time Traveler and Nebogipfel are discovered by a scouting party from the Chronic Expeditionary Force commanded by Hilary Bond that arrived from 1944 to find them based on their remains in 
her
 time. Some time later, a German 
Messerschmitt
 plane arrives over the campsite, drops a 
Carolinum
 bomb (analogous to an 
atomic bomb
 in our world; see Wells' 
The World Set Free
), and devastates the time-traveling Juggernauts and all but twelve of the Force. Nebogipfel and the Time Traveler survive by hiding in the ocean.

Over the next year and a half, the stranded soldiers under Hilary Bond's command start the colony of First London. In off moments, Nebogipfel has worked on repairing the Time-Car and acquired shavings of Plattnerite to power it on a journey through time. When the Time-Car is ready, the Time Traveler joins Nebogipfel in a fifty-million year journey through which they see First London expand and develop colonies on the 
moon
 and in Earth 
orbit
. Eventually, human tampering with the Earth's 
environment
 renders the planet uninhabitable, and humanity departs for the 
stars
. When the Time-Car finally stops due to depletion of its Plattnerite fuel, Nebogipfel and the Time Traveler are tended by a 
Universal Constructor
, a life form (or lifeforms) composed of thousands of 
nanotechnological
 entities. They see that there are few stars left in the night sky; this is due to the human descendants colonizing many worlds and constructing 
Dyson Spheres
 around the host stars. The goal of the 
Universal Constructor
 is to harvest the energy of the sun to build time-travel vehicles from Plattnerite and travel to the beginning of the 
universe
. However, this goal is not due to be completed for a million years.

Nebogipfel and the Time Traveler acquire enough Plattnerite from the Constructors to journey to the point in the future (i.e. another million years hence) when the Constructors will have finished building their time ships. Once the Time Traveler and Nebogipfel reach this point, the Constructors integrate them into a time ship and thus begins the journey back to time's beginning. At this central point from where all matter and energy and timelines branch off, the Constructors apparently start a new history in which they become something even more grand and knowledgeable than before. These successors of the Constructors place the Time Traveler and Nebogipfel into the Time Traveler's original history in the year 1871. It is revealed that the Time Traveler himself 
is
 the mysterious stranger who gave his younger self the Plattnerite sample under the 
alias
 ""Gottfried Plattner"", and that because of this, the circle of causality is closed and thus, the whole multiplicity of histories which ends up creating the Constructors and their successors begins anew. Nebogipfel, with his consciousness enhanced by his time with the Constructors, leaves the Time Traveler behind to travel with the successors of the Constructors. These successors plan to travel ""beyond"" the ""local"" multiplicity into a new realm of historical dimensions.

The Time Traveler then makes one final journey to AD 802,701, along his historical axis, and just barely saves Weena from the death she suffered before. Since (the reader is led to suppose) travelling in time again would cause this reality to branch off and become inaccessible again, the Time Traveler destroys the machine and encourages the Eloi in an 
Agrarian Revolution
 to reduce their dependence on the Morlocks for food and clothing, hoping to one day eliminate it entirely. As he works, the Time Traveler writes down the recounting of his adventures and seals them in a Plattnerite packet, a ""
time capsule
"", so to speak, in the hope that it will travel in time to a faithful scribe. Before sealing the packet, the Time Traveler writes that he plans to go into the world of the Morlocks again, hopefully to return and add an appendix to the story. The book ends by saying that no appendix was found."

Billionaire Richard ""Dodge"" Forthrast is declared brain-dead after a routine medical procedure. Friends and family find his last will directs that his body be 
cryonically
 preserved for the purpose of future brain scanning and eventual revival. His wishes are fulfilled, his frozen brain destructively scanned, and his 
connectome
 saved in digital form.

Several years pass in which portable 
augmented reality
 viewers become ubiquitous, social media echo chambers cause rural lawlessness, commercial 
quantum computing
 is feasible, and anonymous 
distributed ledger
 identification becomes popular in business.

Dodge's grandniece Sophia animates Dodge's connectome as an experiment on secure 
distributed computing
, for her senior thesis at 
Princeton
. The connectome remembers nearly nothing, but names itself ""Egdod"" after Dodge's character in the video game made by his company. It builds a virtual world, with physical laws similar to what little it does ""remember"". Wealthy anonymous donors initially fund the support of datacenters running this ""world"". Brain scanning gains general popularity, after 
traffic analysis
 shows that virtual minds are achieving an afterlife in a medieval fantasy setting.  All the downloaded minds, however, suffer extreme amnesia.

Egdod is usurped by El, a terminally, and mentally, ill billionaire who is funding the computing process. El believes that Dodge not only lacked imagination when constructing the virtual world, but that he also consumes a disproportionate amount of computing power. El conquers the world, isolates Dodge (with the power of his mind, aided by augmentation by his private data centers). El subjugates the (virtual) population with a religion centered upon worship of him. Sophia (after being murdered by El) enters this virtual world, to assist Dodge in disrupting El's power. She, and several other characters, embark on an epic quest. Stephenson, in narrating this, is able to describe many aspects of this medieval fantasy world, and of the beliefs that El has instilled amongst its peoples. In the end Dodge and El have one final confrontation to determine whose vision for this virtual world prevails."

Seven hundred years before the story's start, humankind colonized 
Luna
, where the Society—a rigid social hierarchy of 14 Colors with specialized roles—was developed for efficiency and order. The Society, harshly ruled by certain families of mentally and physically superior Golds, conquered 
Earth
 and colonized moons and small planets. Reds are the Society's lowest-status laborers. 
Mars
's underground Red mining colonies compete in rigged contests that sow discord and are lied to that Mars is not yet 
terraformed
.

At the story's outset, 16-year-old Darrow is a rash, intelligent, dexterous, newly-wed Red 
helium-3
 miner. Darrow and his wife Eo are publicly whipped for visiting a restricted underground forest. With Mars's ArchGovernor Nero present and the event being filmed, Eo sings a song protesting the Reds' enslavement. Nero has Eo publicly hanged. A grieving Darrow illegally buries Eo and is hanged too, but survives due to his uncle Narol drugging him.

Narol then delivers Darrow to the Sons of 
Ares
, who aim to overturn the Society's hierarchy. The Sons used footage of Eo's song and execution as propaganda. Dancer, a Red, wants Darrow to infiltrate the Society as a Gold. Darrow is physically transformed by Mickey (a Violet) via a ""carving"", physically trained by Harmony (a Red), and taught Gold customs by Matteo (a Pink). 

Under the fabricated Gold identity of ""Darrow au Andromeda"", he excels in testing and is accepted into Mars's Institute. He is drafted into House Mars, one of 12 schoolHouses, where he befriends Cassius. The Institute begins with the Passage where students are beaten, then paired off (a high test scorer with a low test scorer) to fight to the death barehanded. Darrow kills Cassius's brother, Julian, and lies about it. Sevro unexpectedly kills high-status Priam.

Next, in the 
Valles Marineris
, each schoolHouse is assigned a castle and told to conquer the other SchoolHouses. Each schoolHouse's flag can enslave other schoolHouses' students. House Pluto, led by Nero's son Adrius (""the Jackal""), resorts to 
cannibalism
 to survive. Darrow wields a 
scythe
; he is nicknamed ""Reaper"". House Mars fractures into factions: Darrow and Cassius's, Antonia's, Titus's. Sevro operates alone. Quinn saves Darrow from Titus's faction. The bloodthirsty Titus rapes enslaved peers and captures Quinn; Cassius challenges Titus but Titus's group assaults Cassius. Darrow manipulates House Minerva, led by ""Mustang"" (Virginia), into defeating Titus and retreating. Sevro saves Darrow and Cassius from House Minerva. Darrow speaks to a captive Titus and realizes he is a Red that has also undergone a ""carving"" as an agent of the Sons of Ares. To maintain his cover, Darrow sentences Titus to death. Cassius duels and kills Titus, thinking Titus killed Julian.

Darrow outwits and enslaves House Diana and most of House Minerva but lets Virginia escape with her flag, leading the sadistic Vixus away. Adrius's subordinate, Lilath, declares a bounty on Darrow and passes Cassius a pouch that Darrow asks Sevro to steal; Cassius thwarts this and watches the pouch's video of Darrow killing Julian. Antonia, Vixus, and Cassandra use Lea to ambush Darrow. He hides; they execute Lea and flee. Cassius stabs Darrow in a duel and leaves him for dead, usurping House Mars, but Virginia rescues Darrow. As he recovers, they develop romantic feelings. Virginia falls gravely ill. Fitchner, House Mars's Proctor and Sevro's father tells Darrow that Nero manipulated the Proctors to help Adrius. Darrow obtains medicine from Fitchner to cure Virginia.

Darrow and Virginia amass an army by freeing slaves using House Minerva's flag. When Tactus tries to rape Nyla, Darrow has both Tactus and himself whipped, earning his army’s loyalty. Darrow conquers Houses Ceres and Apollo. Sevro rejoins Darrow, who incapacitates Fitchner for his flying boots. Darrow traps Adrius, who amputates his own hand to free himself. The Proctors help Adrius counterattack and escape; Pax protects Darrow; Adrius kills Pax. The Proctors kidnap Virginia. Enraged, Darrow slays Proctor Apollo.

With the Proctors' flying boots, Darrow's army storms Olympus, the Proctors' base, freeing Virginia and capturing the Proctors. Sevro deletes evidence that Darrow is a Red. Darrow usurps Cassius, who declares a blood feud. Learning that Virginia is Adrius's sister, Darrow fears her betrayal, but Virginia dutifully delivers Adrius, and Darrow wins the Institute's title.

Many Golds covet Darrow. Nero proposes to help Darrow join the fleet-commanding Academy and rise to power if Darrow hides Nero's game-rigging and becomes his Lancer (
aide-de-camp
). Darrow agrees, publicly joining House Augustus."

Distress
 describes the political intrigue surrounding a mid-twenty-first century 
physics
 conference, at which is to be presented a unified 
Theory of Everything
.  In the background of the story is an epidemic mental illness, related in some way to the imminent discovery of the TOE.  The action takes place on an 
artificial island
 called ""Stateless"", which has earned the wrath of the world's large 
biotech
 companies for its pilfering of their 
intellectual property
.

The narrator is a journalist for a science channel called SeeNet named Andrew Worth who carries video recording software in an intestinal implant. He is offered a story on a new illness called Distress, but declines. He journeys to Stateless through a series of convoluted flights to cover a presentation by 27-year-old South African physicist Violet Mosala, supplanting the preproduction by a colleague, Sarah Knight. When he arrives, he is informed by an asex anthrocosmologist named Akili that Violet's life is in danger. Violet is finishing her Theory of Everything, which she intends to present on the conference's last day.

Through interfacing with a talkative local, Worth learns that Violet plans to emigrate to Stateless after the conference to use her celebrity status to provide an opportunity for South Africa and other nations to end their support for the United Nations boycott of Stateless. He also witnesses the islands' physical underpinnings: it is basically held up by the activity of millions of micro-organisms. After meeting with a faction of anthrocosmologists, he learns that they believe in the concept that the universe is created by one person's Theory of Everything. That person is called the Keystone.

Worth becomes deathly ill and believes he has been infected with cholera by a faction of anthrocosmologists who wanted him to transmit the disease to Violet Mosala.  He recovers and is kidnapped by this group, who are led by a rival physicist Worth saw with Violet at the conference.  Worth and Akili are held on a tanker where it is explained that these cultists believe Violet's TOE will destroy the world.  Worth signals for help by connecting his implant to a port on the ship.  He and Akili are rescued by citizens of Stateless.

Worth returns to the conference and learns that a biotech conglomerate sent a militia to Stateless, angry at the technology they have appropriated. He negotiates with the militia to let a suddenly ill Violet return to South Africa, where she dies. Before her illness, however, she tasked an AI to synthesize her final theory. The militia moves to take over the main city of Stateless, brutalizing the citizens as they evacuate to the outskirts. While seemingly helpless to do anything at first, they soon strike back at the invaders by having triggered microorganisms consume the cities structural underpinning, sinking it into the ocean. Worth is fired from SeeNet and Sarah Knight replaces him, covering the war. Worth discovers that Sarah was working with the cultists, and that AIs are exhibiting symptoms of the titular mental illness as well. Believing that the AI that wrote the paper became the Keystone and that Distress will continue until a human reads it, Worth downloads and reads the paper, and realizes that all minds, together, collaborate in being ""the"" Keystone, giving all of humanity an intuitive connection with the universe."

Most games are reruns, with team after team of players attempting to complete the pre-packaged adventure.  But someone always has to be first – and every player wants to be part of the initial team that beta tests a game.

Candidia Maria Smith-Foster, an eleven-year-old girl, is unaware that she is a 
Homo post hominem
, mankind's next evolutionary step. 
Hominem
s have higher IQs, they're stronger, faster, more resistant to illness and trauma, and have quicker reflexes. Their eyesight, hearing, and sense of smell are superior as well.

By the time the narrative opens, Candy has acquired a high school education, some college, and learned karate, having achieved her Fifth Degree Black Belt from her neighbor, 73-year-old Soo Kim McDivott, who she is led to believe is merely a retired schoolteacher. McDivott, whom she calls ""Teacher"", is actually the discoverer of the 
H. post hominem
 species, and has identified and continues to mentor and lead a group of them, the AAs. As part of her karate training, she has learned to release her 
hysterical strength
, which permits brief bursts of nearly superhuman activity.

With international relations rapidly deteriorating, Candy's father, publicly a small-town pathologist but secretly a government 
biowarfare
 expert, is called to Washington. Candy remains at home.

The following day a worldwide attack, featuring a bionuclear plague, wipes out virtually all of humanity (i.e., 
Homo sapiens
). With pet bird Terry, a 
Hyacinthine macaw
, her ""lifelong retarded, adopted twin brother,"" who tends to ""parrot"" Candy's words even before she speaks, she survives the attack in the shelter beneath their house. Emerging three months later, she learns of her genetic heritage and sets off to search for others of her kind.

First the hunt turns up ""Adam"", a cheeky, irrepressibly punning, multitalented 13-year-old boy, who immediately sets out to win Candy's heart; next, Rollo Jones, a middle-aged physician with a broad history of survival-in-the-wilds experience ranging from a stint in the Peace Corps to mountain climbing; and finally, Kim Melon, an early-20s mom whose background is in computer engineering with Lisa, her six-year-old daughter. Rollo reveals himself as a sociopath, whom Candy is forced to kill defending Terry and herself.  Adam, Kim, and Lisa join Candy's quest for the AA community.  As part of the search, Adam reveals that he is an ultralight aircraft pilot.  Later he teaches Candy to fly.

Thereafter, an ultralight engine failure separates Candy from the others.  After getting it running again, she spots a contrail, which leads her to Vandenberg Space Shuttle Launch Complex, where Teacher and the AAs are laboring to preflight a shuttle, renamed the 
Nathan Hale
.  They have identified those who wiped out mankind, the 
Bratstvo
, translated as the ""Brotherhood"", a cabal of 
H. sapiens
, working from inside the Russian military to destroy all 
H. post hominem
s.  As insurance, they have  placed a doomsday device in geosynchronous orbit, a 
Strontium
-90 bomb whose fallout will render Earth uninhabitable for 200 years.

At this point, however, the AAs' plans have come unstuck:  They have modified the 
Hale
 to reach geosynch orbit, though it is a one-way, suicide voyage for the crew; but the miniature robot handler they have built to penetrate the bomb-carrying rocket and disarm the doomsday device is not up to the task.  Candy realizes, with her small size and hysterical strength training, she is the only one who can get inside the warhead chamber and disarm the bomb.  Despite the fact that it is a suicide mission, she volunteers.

Meanwhile, as Adam, Kim, and Lisa search for Candy, Terry begins relaying her thoughts, though initially they do not realize that is what they're hearing.

Arriving in orbit, Kyril Svetlanov, thought to be a 
Bratstvo
 defector, kills Harris Gilbert, the mission commander.  Kyril turns out to have been a double agent, whose job ultimately was to sabotage the mission, but he does not know about Candy's karate skills.  She breaks his neck and assumes responsibility for completing the mission.

Navigating across to the bomb-carrying rocket in a spacesuit, she disables the warhead.  Then she resets the navigational computer to land on the dry lake at Edwards Air Force Base and tries to secure herself against a bulkhead in preparation for the stresses of reentry.

As the missile begins to power-up for reentry, Adam finally realizes Terry is in fact relaying Candy's thoughts; that somehow she is in fact in space, about to attempt reentry in a non-human-rated vehicle, and that she'll soon be landing at Edwards.  He, Kim, and Lisa arrive as the missile is touching down, just in time to extract her, resuscitate her, and treat her injuries.

The author has left a number of threads trailing at the conclusion, some of which are followed-up on 25 years later in a sequel entitled

In the beginning of 
Ombria in Shadow
, Royce Greve, ruler of Ombria, has just died and his mistress Lydea is being thrown out of the castle by the ancient, evil, and powerful Domina Pearl who wishes to gain control over the court by acting as regent for Royce's young son Kyel. Lydea flees through the dangerous night-time streets and eventually, with some aid from a mysterious source, reaches the tavern of her father. Meanwhile, beneath Ombria, Faey, a 
sorceress
 who can wear any face she likes, and her assistant Mag, who helped Lydea survive her flight from the castle, work on magical potions and charms for the wealthy of the city, including Domina Pearl.

In the castle Ducon Greve, Royce's bastard nephew, tries to support Kyel against the machinations of Domina Pearl in an increasingly paranoid climate. Various nobles, unhappy with Domina's ruthless rule, attempt to convince him to work against her and set himself up as the new prince of Ombria. Unwilling to go down such a dangerous route and concerned that it could have dire consequences for Kyel, Ducon manages to foist them off, escaping through the vast network of secret passageways and rooms that permeate the castle.

Faey is hired by one of Ducon's enemies to kill him; she makes a magical piece of charcoal that is imbued with poison. Mag, who has been observing Ducon, does not want him to die and searches for a way to undo the spell. However, she becomes trapped in the castle, eventually freed by the historian Camas Erl on the promise that she will bring him to meet Faey, who has been alive for ages, and whose history is entwined with the city's.

Ducon uses the charcoal to sketch a man who looks just like him, who seems to come to life. Pursuing him, but delirious from the poison, he inadvertently falls into Faey's lair. Lydea, there to seek Faey's help, insists that Faey cure him. With Ducon and Faey's help, Lydea is able to return to the castle where she works as Kyel's tutor alongside Camas Erl, who is obsessed with discovering the secret to Ombria's shadowy underworld. After being introduced to Faey, Camas wanders the underworld, trying to find out about the Shadow City and how Ombria has been changed in the past by its manifestation.

Mag is given a pendant by Faey, which had been left with her as a baby on Faey's doorstep. Using the small piece of charcoal that she finds inside, Mag begins to draw random shapes. The drawings are able to destroy various parts of Domina's body. Domina, enraged by what she considers Faey's betrayal, captures Ducon and Lydea along with Mag, bringing them to the secret room where she keeps her regenerative bed, the reason that she has lived so long. Faey leaves the underworld, and the stirrings of the incredibly powerful sorceress are the trigger for the manifestation of the Shadow City. While Ducon fights Domina, Lydea escapes with Kyel by running through a rift into the Shadow City shown to her by the same mysterious man seen earlier by Ducon. Ducon kills Domina, and then meets the man who looks like him - His father. From Ombria's reflection, years ago he fell in love with Royce's sister, and tarried with her long enough to get her with child. The shadow transition eventually finishes, and Ombria has changed. No one has memories of the previous Ombria but for Faey and Mag. Ducon is now Prince and Lydea his love, Kyel is his heir and Mag is Kyel's tutor. All is happy."

 is set several decades after the 
zombie apocalypse
, referred to as the Rising. Two man-made viruses (a cure for cancer and a cure for the common cold) combined to form Kellis-Amberlee, a virus that quickly infects all 
mammalian
 life. Kellis-Amberlee is normally benign, but the virus can ""go live"" or ""amplify"", converting any host mammal over 40 pounds (18 kg) into a 
zombie
. There are three mentioned ways amplification takes place: the death of the host, contact with a live specimen (being bitten by a zombie) and spontaneous conversion. Those infected that have not undergone amplification remain lucid until the virus has time to spread through the body. Lucidity is followed by lack of sensitivity to pain, memory loss and finally conversion.

Most humans reside in tightly controlled safe zones, with rigorous blood testing and decontamination protocols used to prevent the spread of the live K-A virus. After the inaction of 
traditional media
 during the Rising, 
blogs

 occurs in 2040 and is written from the perspective of Georgia ""George"" Mason, a Newsie blogger and head of the After the End Times website. Georgia, her brother Shaun (an Irwin), and their friend Georgette ""Buffy"" Meissonier (a Fictional and a technology guru), are selected to cover the 
presidential campaign
 of Senator Peter Ryman, a 
moderate
 
Republican
. The campaign is mostly uneventful until it reaches 
Eakly, Oklahoma
, where zombies attack the campaign convoy, killing several before security (assisted by Georgia and Shaun) can contain them; they later discover it was an orchestrated attack. The next stage of the campaign is the 
Republican National Convention
, where Ryman faces off against 
religious, right-wing
 Governor David Tate and sex-over-substance Congresswoman Kristen Wagman. During the convention, Rick Cousins (a Newsie and former print journalist) defects from Wagman's campaign to join After the End Times. Ryman is selected as the Republican presidential candidate, but as this is announced, Georgia learns that a zombie outbreak occurred at the senator's horse ranch, and his eldest daughter is dead. Georgia and company investigate and find that the outbreak started from a horse injected with the live virus.

Ryman and the campaign relocate to Texas, where Ryman joins his 
vice-presidential
 candidate: Tate. The bloggers must drive their vehicles and equipment overland. During the trip, the journalists' convoy (which has become separated from that part of the presidential entourage that drove ahead of them) is attacked by a sniper. Georgia, Shaun, and Rick survive, but the van carrying Buffy and Chuck (Buffy's beau) crashes. Chuck dies, zombifies, and bites Buffy. She confesses to leaking information to a group undermining Ryman's campaign; the attack occurred because she had refused to continue. After administering a coup de grâce, Georgia calls for rescue, but the 
Centers for Disease Control
 (CDC) team drugs the surviving group members and takes them for testing. After being released, the team's work on the campaign is hampered as they dig into the underlying conspiracy, souring the bloggers' relationship with Ryman and Tate. The team finds evidence linking Tate to the attacks, along with hints of a broader conspiracy involving the CDC and other parties, but when Georgia confronts Ryman during an event in 
Sacramento, California
, he is skeptical and sends them away to prepare to convince him with facts, otherwise he will fire them from the campaign. As the bloggers leave, they are attacked, and Georgia is shot with a 
tranquiliser dart
 containing the live virus. Rick escapes with a copy of the group's evidence just before a zombie outbreak is instigated, and Shaun helps Georgia expose the conspiracy through one last blog post. She then begins amplifying, forcing Shaun to execute her.

The novel's narration then changes to Shaun's perspective. He rallies Ryman's security detail to help contain the outbreak, then breaks into the convention centre to confront Ryman and Tate. Tate takes Ryman's wife hostage with a syringe of the zombie virus, claiming his actions were part of a plot using fear of the zombies to reshape America into a more faith-based society. Then the governor injects himself instead, and Shaun shoots him to prevent zombification.

The first chapter, originally a short story, uses the family of one carpet-maker to describe the generations-long tradition of hair carpet-making on an unnamed world and how it was based on religious devotion to a distant, and seemingly immortal, Emperor.  The next several chapters describe more of the carpet-making culture from the viewpoints of a carpet buyer, a teacher with religious doubts, another carpet maker, a traveling peddler and a tax collector.  Some of them are aware of rumours that the reign of the Emperor may be at an end after tens of thousands of years.  As the story expands beyond one planet, we learn that a rebellion has in fact overthrown the central government and killed the Emperor and is bringing the news to the galactic region which includes the carpet-makers---a region that seems to have been removed from all official records.  The rebel leader who killed the Emperor has a secret:  the rebels' success and the Emperor's death were planned by the Emperor himself, grown weary of his long life.  Meanwhile, a distant space station near a black hole continues to serve as a delivery point for all the hair carpets, which come from not only one world, but more than ten thousand.  In an isolated bubble of space, removed from all the other stars of the galaxy, a lone planet is, over millennia, being paved flat.  Only an ancient palace remains and, within it, a captive former king kept alive by artificial means is forced to watch the destruction of his world.  The rebel leaders are astonished to learn that all the hair carpets have been sent through a hidden portal to this world and now cover most of its surface.  Back at the Imperial Archives, the still-loyal Archivist finally tells the ancient story:  the conquered king had teased the Emperor's predecessor about being unable to grow hair on his head, so in vengeance the old Emperor had decided to cover his enemy's entire planet with the hair of his former subjects, a plan which the next Emperor had allowed to continue for 100,000 years."

The Survivors live deep underground in a world of complete darkness, divided into two clans, one living in the Lower Level and one in the Upper Level. Their legends tell of the Original World where man lived alongside the Light Almighty (a concept of which they can no longer conceive) and away from the ultimate evil, Radiation, with its two Lieutenants the Twin Devils Cobalt and Strontium. The Lower Level Survivors venerate a relic known as the Holy Bulb. ""
So compassionate was the Almighty
 (it was the Guardian of the Way's voice that came back [to Jared] now) 
that when He banished man from Paradise, He sent parts of Himself to be with us for a while. And He dwelled in many little vessels like this Holy Bulb
.""

Jared is the son of the Prime Survivor, the leader of the Lower Level clan. He is himself due to become a Survivor (i.e. an adult clansman), but Jared is too busy with his quest to find Light. He rationalizes that to find distant Light he must first locate its opposite, Darkness, which is near and ""abounds in the worlds of men!"" He goes on to theorize that:

""Darkness must be something real. Only, we can't recognize it.""

...

""There's a clue [however]. We know that in the Original World - the first world that man inhabited after he left Paradise - we were closer to Light Almighty. In other words, it was a good world. Now let's suppose there's some sort of connection between sin and evil and this Darkness stuff. That means there must be 
less
 Darkness in the Original World, Right?""

...

""Then all I have to do is find something there's less of in the Original World [than there is here].""

...

""If Darkness is connected with evil and if Light is its opposite, then Light must be good. And if I find Darkness, then I may have some kind of idea as to the nature of Light.""

By leaving the safety of the central echo-caster, with only a pair of click stones with which to listen, Jared exposes himself to soubat (once common cave bats that either ""Cobalt or Strontium took ... down to Radiation and made [them] over into ... super-creature[s]"") and Zivvers (people with an apparently unfathomable ability to navigate despite having poor hearing compared to the Survivors; it turns out that Zivvers navigate in darkness using infrared, while Survivors use echolocation). The soubats and Zivvers are thought of as similar, or even related, by the Survivors because of their similar abilities. ""It was an uncanny ability nobody could explain, except to say [soubats and Zivvers] were possessed of Cobalt or Strontium.""

Jared's quest for Light is interrupted by unexplained disappearances and an arranged marriage to Della, a girl from the Upper Level, the daughter of their chief 'the Wheel'. Things get progressively worse as strange monsters roam the world and the hot springs begin to dry up. Along with his betrothed, Jared sets out for the Zivver world, hoping it will bring him closer to Light, instead they find themselves fleeing from the monsters once again, and being pushed closer to the Original World."

Born in 1840, Enoch Wallace is an 
American Civil War
 veteran who fought at the 
Battle of Gettysburg
. He is recruited by an 
alien
, whom Enoch names Ulysses (after 
Ulysses S. Grant
), to operate a way station for interstellar travelers for Galactic Central. The equipment is installed in his house, while he lives in a small adjoining shed. His job is to monitor the machinery, including the regular and emergency ""materializers"", and make sure the biological needs of the wide variety of travelers are met. Enoch tries to communicate with them, with varying degrees of success, and befriends some of them.

He does not age while he is inside. His neighbors are aware of his longevity, but he keeps to his family farm, and they mind their own business. He has only a few friends, including old mailman Winslowe Smith and a woman in her early twenties, 
deaf-mute
 neighbor Lucy.

Almost a hundred years later, the 
US government
 becomes aware of him, and 
CIA
 agent Claude Lewis is sent to investigate. Lewis and his team secretly keep him under surveillance for two years. Enoch realizes he is being watched, but is not overly concerned.

One day, Lucy comes running to Enoch. She shows him her back; she has been whipped until she bled. When he sees her pursuers approaching, he takes her into the house on impulse, breaking his rule of letting no human inside. Hank Fisher (her 
white trash
 father) and her brother come. Lucy tried to stop her brother from training his new 
coon
 dog using a live animal, eventually paralyzing first the dog, then his master, with her mind. Her father then started whipping her, so she temporarily blinded him and ran away. When the men accuse Enoch of harboring her, he invites them to search. Hank tries to enter the house, but cannot, even with an axe. Enoch tells them to leave and never come back.

Ulysses shows up. Years before, an aged 
Vegan
 had died at the station, and in accordance with Vegan custom, Enoch had buried the body in the family plot. The authorities dug it up and took it away, upsetting the Vegans. Alien factions opposed to expansion in this direction seize upon the incident to force the tolerant Vegans to deliver an official protest to Enoch as representative of the Earth and have the station shut down. Ulysses gives Enoch the option of remaining on Earth (and aging normally) or manning another station.

Enoch tells Lewis it is vital that the body be returned. Lewis agrees. However, Ulysses does not believe it will change the decision.

Ulysses gives Enoch further bad news. Long ago, a mystic had created the Talisman, which enables people to make contact with the universal ""spiritual force"". It is unique, and with the death of the mystic, nobody has been able to create another. Very few possess the sensitivity or rapport to activate the device, perhaps one in many billions; the custodian took it from planet to planet for others to see and use. The Talisman was lost, misplaced or possibly stolen several years before. Despite the news being kept secret, Ulysses suspects the unusual unrest in the galaxy is somehow linked to its disappearance.

Enoch reveals that he has used the ""
Mizar
 system of statistics"" to determine that war is looming on Earth. Ulysses informs him that there is a drastic, reliable method to stop it, but Enoch alone can apply for its use. It creates the mental inability to operate or understand machines for several generations before gradually wearing off. Enoch is undecided.

He starts packing his journals and alien artifacts he has been given by travelers, having decided to remain on Earth, but is interrupted when a ""ratlike creature"" emerges unannounced from the official materializer. The intruder takes out what looks like a gun, but Enoch grapples with it. The creature flees outside. Enoch chases after, and luckily his quarry runs into a dead end. The alien fires at him. Lucy and Ulysses arrive separately, and the latter tells Enoch that the intruder has the Talisman. Then they see Lucy struggling with the creature. Ulysses tells Enoch to shoot, and Enoch finally does, killing the alien. As Lucy comes to them with the Talisman, Ulysses joyfully tells Enoch that she is its new custodian, perhaps the best custodian in centuries. A mob, incited by Hank Fisher's lies, comes for Enoch, but Ulysses has Lucy use the Talisman to calm them down.

Afterward, Enoch ""borrows"" Lucy and the Talisman to attend a scheduled peace conference, before she leaves to take the Talisman around the galaxy. Ulysses states that Earth will become part of the galactic community because of her."

The book covers several periods from the life of 
Lazarus Long
 (born Woodrow Wilson Smith), an early beneficiary of a breeding experiment designed to increase mankind's natural lifespan.  The experiment is known as the Howard Families, after the program's initiator.  Lazarus is the result of more a mutation than the breeding experiment, and he is the oldest living human at more than two thousand years old.

The first half of the book takes the form of several 
novellas
 connected by Lazarus's retrospective narrative.  In the 
framing story
, Lazarus has decided that life is no longer worth living, but, in what is described as a reverse 
Arabian Nights
 scenario, agrees not to end his life for as long as his companion and descendant, chief executive of the Howard Families Ira Weatheral, will listen to his stories.



""The Tale of the Man Who Was Too Lazy to Fail""
[
edit

This story concerns a 20th-century 
United States Navy
 
seaman
, 
midshipman
, and 
officer
 David Lamb, who receives multiple promotions while minimizing any semblance of real work or combat by applying himself enthusiastically to the principle of ""constructive laziness"".



""The Tale of the Twins Who Weren't""
[
edit
]


Lazarus tells of his visit as an interplanetary cargo trader to a planet, where he bought a pair of slaves, brother and sister, and immediately 
manumitted
 them. Because they had no knowledge of independent living or any education, Lazarus teaches them ""how to be human"" during the voyage.

The two were the result of an experiment in genetic recombination in which two parent cells were separated into complementary 
haploid
 
gametes
 and recombined into two embryos. The resulting 
zygotes
 were implanted in a woman and gestated by her, with the result that although both have the same surrogate mother and genetic parents, they are no more closely related genetically than any two people taken at random. They have been prevented from sexual relations by a 
chastity belt
. However, having confirmed that there is no risk of genetic disease in their offspring (described as the only valid argument against 
incest
), Lazarus solemnizes their marriage and later establishes them as the owners and operators of a thriving business. At the end of the story, he reveals that the twins looked the same age decades later and expresses his belief that they were his own descendants, from an earlier time that he had been a slave on the same planet.



""The Tale of the Adopted Daughter""
[
edit
]


A short scene-setter introduces a planet on which Lazarus has led a group of pioneering colonists.

Lazarus, now working as a banker and shopkeeper on the frontier planet and keeping his true age secret, saves a young girl, Dora, from a burning house and becomes her guardian. When she becomes an adult, he leaves the area but returns as a younger man and marries her, and the two move away to start a new settlement, where Lazarus' long life is less likely to be noticed. They eventually manage to build a thriving community. Because Dora is not a descendant of the Howard Families, the source of his longevity, she eventually dies of old age, leaving Lazarus to mourn.



""Boondock""
[
edit
]


At the beginning of this story, Lazarus has regained his enthusiasm for life, and the remainder of the book is told in a conventional linear manner. Accompanied by some of his descendants, Lazarus has now moved to a new planet and established a 
polyamorous
 family, with three men, three women, and a larger number of children, two of whom are female clones of Lazarus.



""Da Capo""
[
edit
]


In the concluding tale, Lazarus attempts to travel backward in time to 1919 to experience it as an adult, but an error in calculation places Lazarus in 1916, on the eve of America's involvement in 
World War I
. An unintentional result is that Lazarus falls in love with his own mother. To retain her esteem and that of his grandfather, Lazarus enlists in the army. Eventually, before Lazarus leaves for the war, he and his mother, Maureen, consummate their mutual attraction, as his mother is already pregnant and so accepts that there is no collateral risk.

Virgil Copeland and Randall Panwar are forced to present a project review to the senior staff of 
Equatorial Systems
, and their fellow scientist Gabrielle Villanti fails to attend. Panwar struggles with the presentation, in which they present their research about asterids (artificial neurons) known as LOVs. Although LOVs showed promise in initial experiments, the enhanced intelligence of the test animals was offset by the 
uncontrolled growth
 of the LOVs, which eventually killed their hosts. LOVs were therefore made dependent on two 
amino acids
: 
nopaline
 for 
metabolism
 and 
octopine
 for 
reproduction
. In the second phase of the experiment, the LOVs were encased in 
silicate
 shells. These LOVs were able to safely interact with the test animals, but an unrelated incident at a rival 
biotechnology
 company prompted a government crackdown, and the LOVs were exported to the 
Hammer
, a space station in low Earth orbit.

Panwar's presentation is interrupted by news of an incident at the lab. Gabrielle, Panwar, and Virgil had illegally implanted LOV clusters on their foreheads to communicate with the LOV colonies in their care, and Gabrielle had entered a 
fugue state
 and died of exhaustion while connected to their latest experimental subject. Their administrators discover Virgil attempting to surreptitiously remove the LOVs from Gabrielle's corpse, and the two surviving scientists are put into 
quarantine
. However, the LOV colony is more intelligent and resourceful than anticipated, and overcomes several obstacles to colonize key areas of the 
Hammer
. When it learns what has happened, it takes control of several drones and severs the lab module from the space station.

Ela Suvanatat is a freelance journalist doing a story on struggling fishing villages in Vietnam when the 
Equasys
 lab module crashes offshore. Although it is quickly declared off-limits by the government, Ela hires a boat and visits the crash site. She is able to scoop up a few stray LOVs which have survived 
atmospheric reentry
 and return to shore before the military arrives and cordons off the site.

Fleeing from military patrols through marshland, Ela comes into contact with the 
Roi Nuoc
, a group of children under the care of a nearly sentient computer program named 
Mother Tiger
. The 
Roi Nuoc
 take her to one of their benefactors, a businessman named Ky Xuan Nguyen. At his house, Ela discovers that the packet of LOVs has torn and most of them are missing, but a few LOVs are still lodged in her forehead.

Meanwhile, Virgil and Panwar attempt to escape from quarantine, but Panwar is gunned down and Virgil is only just able to reach Panwar's one-man automated submarine. Virgil soon receives a message from Ela, who is worried that her LOVs seem to be dying. He tells her that 
crown galls
 on some plants might contain nopaline, and orders her a supply of both nopaline and octopine tablets from a chemical supply company.

Ela is forced to flee her 
safe house
 when the military begins a house-to-house search, but she stops to gather crown galls and then asks one of the 
Roi Nuoc
 to lead her back to the pool where she took shelter after swimming ashore. At the pool, Ela puts half of her crown galls into the mud, hoping to save any LOVs which had reached the water."

9-year-old Prabir Suresh lives on a small tropical island among the South Moluccas where strange 
mutations
 generate unique plants, birds and creatures. His life revolves around the jungle, which he calls Teranesia; school; and friendships he makes on the internet. Prabir lives on the island with his baby sister, Madhusree and parents who are both research 
biologists
, currently studying the evolution of a species of butterflies that strays from conventional 
evolution
.

Civil war breaks out in 
Indonesia
, with heated attacks against the 
Javanese
 empire. One day planes fly by and drop mines, some falling in Prabir's family garden. While tending to the garden the next day, Prabir's father is gravely injured by a mine. Prabir and his mother attempt to help pull his father out of the garden, but his mother loses her balance and Prabir witnesses them both die after falling on another mine. Shocked from the explosion and sudden death of his parents, Prabir escapes the island with his fifteen-month-old sister. As the civil war expands across the area, they scramble on a boat to the nearest inhabited island, where they are taken to 
Australia
, and seek asylum with their aunt in 
Canada
, far way away from Teranesia and their family's homeland of 
India
.

Prabir dedicates his life to parenting Madhusree over the next 20 years, while navigating his sexuality as a gay man and being separated from his homeland. He starts work at a bank and Madhusree grows to pursue biology, carrying the lineage of their parents' passion for evolutionary research. One day, reports emerge of an abnormal species of plants and animals that have mutated throughout the South Moluccas region that are going out of control, including on the island Prabir called Teranesia. Prabir recognises the similarity in these characteristics to the butterflies his parents were studying many years ago. Madhusree decides to go on a scientific expedition to explore these strange mutations. Prabir suffers anxiety and apprehension at the thought of revisiting the islands they grew up in. He tries desperately to convince Madhusree not to go, but this only motivates her more strongly. Prabir, left alone, broods about the meaninglessness of his life and attempts suicide. In the last minute, he decides to chase her to the islands instead, still distressed at the thought of her revisiting Teranesia.

Traveling to back to the islands, Prabir undergoes a traumatic realisation of his past. When Prabir was young, he exchanged messages with a professor in the United States, posing as his father. While trying to reassure her of the growing unrest, he made statements that made him sound like an insurgent. He assumes the messages were intercepted, and believes he's the reason the militia plane flew to their home, ultimately causing his parents' deaths. In considering his past, Prabir realises his effort to prevent Madhusree from traveling to the islands was more to protect himself than her.

Now invigorated to uncover the mystery of the mutations, Prabir encounters Martha Grant, a biologist who is also studying them. Grant is working under a 
pharmaceutical
 company, which forbids her to publish her results. They strike a deal – Prabir will guide her to the island Teranesia if she promises to publish her results on the internet. Grant challenges Prabir, asking if he had ever tried to protect Madhusree for another reason than the fact she's his sister. Prabir becomes agitated at the thought that his inclination to take care of Madhusree was genetically determined rather than a choice he made of his free will.

A research team identifies the gene causing the unusual mutations as the São Paulo protein. A physicist on the team suggests the protein uses 
quantum superposition
 to figure out which mutation is most beneficial to the 
organism
. They realise this is how the mutations are propagating at such a rapid pace. 

Prabir gets scratched by mutant shrubs that are native to the island. After exploring his family's former home, disgusted by his behaviour as a child, he proceeds to the mine-infested garden in a suicide attempt. Grant, having pretended to return to their boat but realizing something is off, uses multiple tranquilizer darts to stop Prabir and convince him that his parents' death wasn't his fault. In a moment Prabir ends up regretting, he and Grant begin to kiss, but she rebuffs him when coming to her senses.

When they return to the island where Madhusree'a expedition is camping, Grant and Prabir encounter Christian militia, who end up testing him for the mutant gene, only to find that he carries the São Paulo protein in his bloodstream. The militia commander starts interrogating Prabir, asking if he had raped Grant. Prabir, being gay, realises his uncharacteristic sexual urges towards Grant were probably due to the high libido associated with the protein. Upon reflection of his behaviour and the speed of propagation of the protein, he discerns the protein must have some 
consciousness
 in how to breed most successfully.

The militia group immediately 
quarantines
 Prabir on an offshore boat, only for him to be rescued by Madhusree, who keeps him in an isolation raft. She continuously monitors his condition as they hurry to the nearest hospital, while Prabir's physicality changes in extreme ways. He starts to grow a rigid carapace rendering him immobile. Prabir senses the gene has enabled him to undergo an intense 
metamorphosis
. In the havoc of this change, he realises the gene is going seize all elements of human consciousness - love, intelligence, honesty and reflection. The gene's sole aim is to procreate above everything else, stripping him of his 
sentience
 and agency.

He tells Madhusree to tranquilize and burn him, in an attempt to end his life before he is taken over and stop the spread of the São Paulo protein. She is unable to knock him out due to the protein adapting to the tranquilizing agent. Madhusree has an epiphany and realizes the protein is somehow sentient and is reacting to their attempts to destroy or stop it. She extracts a sample from Prabir's last remaining spot of human flesh, and makes a promise to give it a new host to propagate in. Prabir rapidly returns to normal, and promises to take Madhusree to a festival in Calcutta, where their parents tested the limits of the human body before they were born."

At the end of the journey the crew meets a Centaur-like species on a planet they call Tahir that has left spacefaring behind. Sentient life is also detected in connection with a nearby black hole, a reading confirmed by the Tahirans. Their interest aroused, the Earthlings can send a combined crew to investigate.

Communications with this ""Holont"" is established and much knowledge is acquired. Differences aboard the ship, however, lead to the death of three men (Brent, Russek, and Cleland), and female pilot Kilbirnie crashes into the black hole. The six Earthlings left drop the Tahirans off at their homeworld and head towards Earth.

In between the story jumps regularly back to the development of human society over the gaps of many thousand years and to that of the 
Kith
, the closed group doing the starfaring, who are often shunned by the rest of Earth. The Kith have their own settlements on different planets, where some retire from time to time.

Earth has changed over the long period taken up by the voyage of the 
Envoy
, and no one is much interested in spacefaring anymore. On Harbor, a colony of Earth, the 
Envoy
 crew finds remains of the Kith society, which still are connected to spacefaring. But the last ship to plot trade-routes in space, the 
Fleetwing
, disappears from tracking. The cause is a Zero-Zero-failure ripping off the rear part of the ship. The 
Envoy
 sets out on a rescue mission as soon as possible but twenty years of outside time have passed by the time they reach the 
Fleetwing
. They save the remaining crew, thus building a foundation of experienced spacefarers to start spacefaring anew with the knowledge acquired from the Holont."

The territory is the vicinity of 
Tombstone, Arizona
 in 1881, but also refers to the magicians' power struggle. Most of the characters are named for historical individuals from the era; the aim is a tale that parallels recorded events, but places those in a context where magic is real.

The principal male character, Jesse Fox, is a horse trainer in the manner of 
John Solomon Rarey
. He has professional qualifications, but no stomach to pursue them: he is drifting, uprooted by unease over the abilities that have led to his sister's demotion to madwoman status and his own share of such abilities. The principal female character is Mrs. Mildred Benjamin, widow of David Benjamin, supporting herself as a typesetter for one of the Tombstone newspapers but moonlighting as the freelance author of Wild West stories for a ladies' periodical. She has a slight supernatural talent of perception.

The plot has multiple black magicians as its villains, but avoids identifying just whose hat is blackest until the final showdown. A bungled stagecoach robbery that involved one of the four Earp brothers, Morgan, leads to much ado with misdirected posses and the deaths of all participants except for him. Along the way Jesse's Chinese buddy Chow Lung, another magician, but one who is comfortable in his powers, is also killed, to keep Jesse in Tombstone. Jesse helps fight a major fire in downtown Tombstone and has his injuries nursed by Mildred; Mildred's house burns and Jesse helps her defend the lot from the machinations of a mining outfit that lays claim to the whole neighborhood. Jesse escorts Mildred to a ball, where the pair witness the magical dimensions of an altercation between 
Wyatt Earp
 and 
Doc Holliday
. By the closing pages Jesse has come to accept and is learning to manage his magical abilities, applying them to block Earp's deadly excesses in his efforts to defend and enlarge the well-being of his clan."

Several attempts are made on Giraut's life as he works on his new Ix cycle of music. He is sent back to Wilson, his home planet and culture of Occitan, to complete the new music along with his Office of Special Projects team as protection. Paxa retires from the OSP and leaves Giraut after finding out she cannot be successfully backed up on a psypyx, which would make her death permanent. Giraut begins to fall in love with a fellow musician Azalais who introduces him to Ebles, a contact for rogue colonies outside of Council space which call themselves the Union. Soon after, Azalais is killed and Giraut is severely injured in another assassination attempt.

After Giraut is healed he is contacted again by Union. Margaret sends him, along with Raimbaut and Laprada, to the rogue Union colony of Noucatharia to get to the bottom of several coincidences, including the whereabouts of a possible psypyx of Shan, and to find out who keeps trying to kill him. Once there Giraut begins to fall in love with Rielis, a talented musician and singer, as he tries to uncover what Union wants from him and the Council. It is revealed to Giraut and his team that everyone on Noucatharia is either an aintellect in human form or a chimera human/aintellect, both of which are forbidden horrors in Council space. They are also told there are multiple aintellect conspiracies unknown to the OSP, and that Noucatharia was the site of the first invasion by an unknown Alien army, in which humans were beheaded and aintellects/robots fought as best they could. After another amateurish assassination attempt he is kidnapped, separated from his team, and implanted with Shan's psypyx.

As Rielis questions Shan, Giraut and Rielis rapidly come to know what happened on Addams to cause it to lose contact with Earth. An aggressive alien aintellect-run invasion overwhelmed their defenses and killed everyone not in hiding—their goal being to destructively holograph brains, deconstruct aintellects and send back those memories and experiences to their home planet to be consumed as entertainment for their dependent organic creators who had isolated themselves in virtual reality. Only by advanced planning by Shan's father and help from his personal aintellect was a very young Shan able to escape via springer to Earth.

The OSP invades Noucatharia with help from Raimbaut just as Giraut/Shan and Rielis are beginning to agree on the cooperation that is needed between the Council and the Union to face the alien threat. Giraut/Shan are held prisoner by Margaret until the OSP can sort out friend from foe, but Paxa comes through a springer to free Giraut. He quickly recognizes that Paxa is joined to Azalais as a chimera in exchange for being able to be psypyxed in the future, and to help the progressive and dynamic Union face an alien threat. Giraut/Shan and Paxa/Azalais mount a rescue mission and free the aintellect humans and chimeras from OSP control and get Raimbaut to join them.

Raimbaut and Giraut/Shan then choose to stay behind in an attempt to rescue or destroy a Rielis psypyx from an OSP building before it can be tortured for its knowledge and secrets. They destroy the psypyx and Margaret captures them before they can make it to a springer. Raimbaut is quickly cleared of charges and Shan is eventually implanted in Margaret's brain—but Giraut is found guilty of assisting the aintellect conspiracies in escaping from Noucatharia. His trial is a rallying cry for human supremacists, but over time and as the facts come out they are increasingly marginalized by society who see Giraut as a martyr. The only thing left is for him to be executed to permit his public beheading to serve as a unifying story for future generations, as contact is made with the aintellect-run Union colonies."

The novel is set in a world that is 
tidally locked
. Thus one side of the 
planet
 is always in light, and the other in darkness. 
Science
 rules on the dayside, while 
magic
 holds sway in the night.

Powerful magical entities live on the night side of the planet, and for the most part the entities' magical powers emanate from distinct loci.  Jack of Shadows (also known as Shadowjack), the main character, is unique among the magical beings in that he draws his power not from a physical location but from 
shadow
 itself. He is nearly incapacitated in complete light or complete darkness, but given access to even a small area of shadow, his potency is unmatched.

Jack's only friend, the creature Morningstar, is punished by being trapped in stone at the edge of the night, to be released when dawn comes.  His torso and head protrude from the rock, and he awaits the sun that will never rise.

Jack seeks ""The Key That Was Lost"", Kolwynia. The Key itself and the consequences of its use parallel Jack's progress in his own endeavors. Ultimately, the Key will be responsible for Jack's salvation and his doom.

Fleeing the dark side, Jack gets access to a computer and uses it to recover Kolwynia.  This makes him unbeatable, but not all-powerful.  Having made a mess of ruling with his new powers, he seeks the advice of Morningstar, who advises him to destroy The Machine at the Heart of the World, which maintains the world's stability, and set it rotating."

The book begins with the Mysterious Stranger, known as X, the renegade Ethical (one of the Riverworld's creators) who posed as the engineer Barry Thorn on the airship 
Parseval
 and there murdered Milton Firebrass and several others, all of whom were fellow Ethicals.  He is now posing as a Mayan named Ah Qaaq, in the company of the 
Chinese
 poet 
Li Po
.  Through his internal reverie he reveals that his identity was discovered by Monat Grrautut, the director of the Riverworld project, who recalled 'X' to the Dark Tower to be judged. Against this, 'X' used a remote command to kill all the inhabitants of the tower and stop the resurrections of Riverworld's inhabitants. His reverie when the left bank's 'grailstones' (supplying food and stimulants) fail to operate and are not mended by the Ethicals, who are either dead or confined (like 'X' himself) to the river. After the grailstones fail, the inhabitants of the left bank invade the right for resources, and half of humanity dies in the conflict.

Concurrently, protagonist Richard Burton and his friends have joined the crew of 
King John
's ship, the 
Rex Grandissimus
, where Burton, masquerading as a Dark Age Welsh warrior, becomes King John's security chief.  One day 
Tom Mix
, 
Jack London
, and 
Peter Jairus Frigate
 apply to join the crew; and Burton, recognizing Frigate, attacks him as a spy for the Ethicals. Realizing his mistake, Burton allies himself with Frigate, Mix, and London. Meanwhile, the Ethical Monat Grrautut has boarded Sam Clemens' ship, where he is murdered by the renegade Ethical.

Eventually, the two riverboats reach Virolando, a wide lake before the headwaters, home to the pacifist Church of the Second Chance, where 
Hermann Göring
 has become a priest. There, King John and Clemens begin an aerial dog-fight, and later a naval combat in which both riverboats are sunk and most of the crews die. King John is killed by Clemens and Clemens dies of a heart attack after being pulled from the water by his mortal enemy 
Erik Bloodaxe
, who has become an adherent of the Church of the Second Chance, and seeks no revenge against Clemens. Among the survivors are Burton, Frigate, Alice, Joe Miller, Li Po, Ah Qaaq, and Nur ed-Din (""Light of the Faith""), now joined by 
Tom Turpin
, 
Aphra Behn
, a man claiming to be 
Gilgamesh
, and 
Baron de Marbot
.  They take the only craft to survive the fight upriver, then scale the waterfall at the end of the river and enter the polar sea.  At the tower, they expose Ah Qaaq as the renegade Ethical and take him prisoner.  He identifies himself as Loga, a grandson of 
King Priam
 of 
Troy
, resurrected centuries ago and raised by the alien Ethicals on the Gardenworld.  He reveals the current date is 2307 AD and other stories were false stories to throw off investigators. He reveals also that the Riverworld is a moral test, to allow humanity enlightenment.  When the project is brought to a close the souls of those who have not achieved enlightenment will wander the universe aimlessly. Loga, being obsessed with sparing his earthly family this fate, awakened Burton prematurely, recruited Clemens and the others, and diverted a metal meteorite (disrupting social harmony) to Clemens.

The protagonists discover a malfunction in the computer which runs the tower, threatening to release the stored 
wathans
 (souls), of the people who died on the Riverworld. Göring attempts to fix the computer, but is killed by security measures put in place by Monat, who was a member of the fifth-generation sentient race to receive 
wathans
 from the First Race to have 
wathans
. Alice then devises a way to evade this programming, and deactivate the security. Loga is then able to repair the computer."

Professor Arton Daghdev's biology research is considered heterodox by the Mandate, the 
fascist
 government of Earth. Daghdev's theories contradict the Mandate's assertion that humanity is the pinnacle of evolution, and he additionally consorts with more direct revolutionary thinkers. He is convicted and sent to a labor camp on the 
exoplanet
 Kiln. There, he learns that the government has found remnants of an intelligent alien civilization. Commandant Terolan asks Daghdev to study the ruins and identify the builders. Daghdev is placed under the supervision of Mandate scientist Doctor Primatt.

Life on Kiln is exceedingly complex and interconnected; alien microorganisms have the capacity to infect humans. All Kilnish life is able to hybridize and form “macro-species” which are composed of many different organisms. This level of 
symbiosis
 and 
parasitism
 contradicts the Mandate's human-centric theory of evolution. Primatt is forced to censor her reports to the commandant to conform to scientific orthodoxy.

Daghdev begins a sexual relationship with Primatt while simultaneously planning an uprising with fellow prisoners. On the night of the planned revolt, a worker betrays the conspirators, and the revolution is stomped out. As punishment, Daghdev and Primatt are demoted to Excursions, while the ringleaders are executed. Excursions is the most dangerous job, composed of teams of laborers who are forced to leave the Mandate compound to inspect newly identified ruins.

On an excursion, an elephantine Kilnish animal destroys the team's flier. The Excursionistas are forced to brave the distance back to camp by foot. On the march back to camp, they are infected with Kilnish microbiota. They find that, just as the organisms of Kiln can all reach symbiosis with each other, the Excursionistas can now connect with each other on a nonverbal and subconscious level.

When they return to camp, they use their newfound connection to stage a more successful revolt against the Mandate. The narrative reveals that the “builders” for which the Mandate is searching are not a single species. Instead, they are an 
emergent property
 of the entire Kilnish ecosystem, which can become sentient under the right conditions. The newly awakened sentience, powered partly by the computing power of the Excursionistas’ brains, uses the native life of Kiln to destroy the Mandate's compound. Daghdev and the other survivors plan to return to Earth and colonize it with Kilnish life."

The premise of this novel is the banishment to the seemingly metal-poor planet Treason of a group of people who attempted to create rule by an intellectual elite. The novel centers on the descendants of these anti-democratic thinkers who remain imprisoned on the planet. Through the ages, these descendants have formed nations which warred and allied with one another to gain advantages over their rivals in the race to build a starship. Due to the metal-deficiency on Treason, nations are forced to obtain it through a system of barter using 
teleportation
 devices known as Ambassadors.

The protagonist of the book is Lanik Mueller, 
heir apparent
 to the Mueller family kingdom. The Muellers, through generations of 
eugenics
, have the ability to heal at an accelerated speed and regrow body parts naturally. The dark side to the Mueller nation is that, in order to obtain iron and other metals, they trade organs and body parts, which are harvested from radical regeneratives (""rads""). Radical regeneratives are people whose bodies can't distinguish between health and injury, and so grow extra appendages as well as organs of the opposite sex; although this is a normal phase for most Muellers at the age of 
puberty
, the bodies of radical regeneratives never outgrow it.

After it is discovered that Lanik is a radical regenerative, Lanik's father must essentially banish him from the kingdom, so as to avoid sending him to the ""pens"", a place where radical regeneratives are kept in order to harvest their body parts; exile also functions to get Lanik out of the eye of the Mueller public, as well as to prevent harm from coming to Lanik's supposed younger brother Dinte. The banishment comes in the form of sending Lanik as an emissary and spy to the Nkumai, a rival nation. Due to his radical regenerative body, Lanik has grown breasts, which makes him appear to be a woman. Using this subterfuge, he poses as an ambassador from the 
matriarchal
 nation of Bird in order to discover what the Nkumai are trading in exchange for their abundant metals, which have allowed them to dominate their region militarily.

This mission is only the beginning of the adventure for Lanik, who discovers the secrets of the most powerful nations and at the same time gains additional abilities to save his people and determine the fate of his planet."

The novel is set in the 2100s, about a century after a series of pandemics decimate humanity. Existing governments prove to be unable to deal with the crisis and are discredited; their core functions come to be exercised by the Trusts, corporate entities dominated by the oligarchic Families, which function as both business conglomerates and charitable NGOs. Having restored order, the Trusts evolve into a quasi-feudal political structure resembling an enormous worldwide 
company town
, with managerial cadres serving the owner-class Families and having vast authority over their subordinates. The wider solar system also contains a society of asteroid settlers, who did not experience the pandemic crisis; they retain a more liberal mode of existence, and maintain cautious links with the Trusts, cooperating on matters of mutual interest.

Interstellar travel via quantum teleportation is possible, but difficult and hugely expensive; each launch is enormously energy-intensive, consuming a medium-sized 
Kuiper belt
 ice body. The Trusts and the asteroid dwellers collaborate to send a large scientific expedition to the planet Isis, the only world found so far to possess a complex biota. A significantly older world than Earth, Isis features a rich ecology which is – like Earth's – DNA-based. However, Isian life violently outcompetes terrestrial biology; any exposure to Isian microorganisms causes death within hours. The human research stations on Isis and the expedition's HQ in orbit must be kept sealed and sterile, with elaborate anti-contamination countermeasure. The world is nonetheless deemed worthy of intensive investigation, as understanding an entire evolutionary process parallel to Earth's could provide important biological insights.

As firsthand research on Isis is extremely difficult, an initiative within the Trusts produces a small group of genetically engineered children specially designed to survive its environment, with enhanced immune systems capable of countering the ravenous Isian microbiome. During a Byzantine power struggle among the Trusts' ruling Families, however, the project is deprecated and the children - all girls -  callously disposed of to a brutal orphanage, where most of them die. The sole survivor, Zoe Fisher, is rescued when her patron finally prevails in the inter-Trust power struggle, and is sent to the Isis system, where the researchers are having increasing difficulty maintaining their quarantine. The Isian biota seems to be adapting to their containment measures in ways that seems almost purposeful, with the seeming goal of breaching the seals of the human surface stations.

Zoe is dispatched to one of the surface stations, where she meets and befriends a young man from the asteroid-dweller contingent, and begins making unprotected exploratory trips through the Isian ecology. The marine station is eventually lost when its seals are compromised by a heretofore unknown Isian organism. Some evacuees are quarantined aboard the orbital HQ, where they eventually sicken and die as well, after first experiencing strange hallucinations. The orbital station is found to be contaminated with a microscopic agent capable of tunneling through rubber seals. Its population becomes increasingly ill and erratic; the manager in charge destroys the quantum-entanglement transceiver that is the expedition's only means of communication with Earth. On Isis, the microbiota begins degrading equipment, including the drones and robots necessary for external maintenance of the surface stations. Zoe's patron arrives on a quantum transport, and assumes command of the expedition. With evacuation of the surface stations looming, Zoe is sent on a last-ditch effort to investigate the ""diggers,"" a primitive Isian species that is suspected to be near-sentient.

Zoe encounters the diggers, but the poor condition of her escorting drones makes them unable to intervene when the diggers assault and abduct her. The surface station is abandoned; Zoe's asteroid-dweller friend (who has become her lover) stays behind, going on a hopeless mission in a suit of hazmat armor to rescue her. He finds Zoe dying inside the diggers' underground colony; his own suit breached, they wait to die together. In space, the inhabitants of the orbital station quietly die. Its badly-ill and no longer rational manager attempts to launch the expedition's only Earth-return vehicle to evacuate the senior staff, but all of them also die during the shuttle ride out to it. Meanwhile, a feverish Zoe experiences a hallucinatory quantum link with a 
Gaian
 super-organism consisting of not only all the life of Isis, but a vast number of worlds throughout the galaxy whose life shares a common origin via 
panspermia
, all of them sharing a connection on a quantum level. This line of descent includes Earth life, which however descends from a genetically damaged branch in which the quantum link has been broken. The emergent intelligence cherishes the sentient life that occasionally evolves on its worlds, and regrets that it cannot communicate with humans or control the virulence of the Isian biome. Zoe, her lover, and - it is implied - all the humans who had died after being infected by Isis are ""remembered"" by the super-organism, in a sense living forever within the immortal quantum ""cloud.""

The remaining ground stations fail one by one. Zoe's patron - having been implanted with the same experimental anti-Isian-life countermeasures before leaving Earth - is left alone on the slowly deteriorating orbital station, as the only living human in the Isis system.

In a distant epilogue, a second Earth expedition arrives a century later. It is revealed that the Trusts have fallen, and a more humane regime now rules the Solar System. The new arrivals have advanced synthetic immune systems that make it possible for them to live on Isis without protection."

Isabella Clara Eugenia
, in this history the Spanish-imposed Queen of England


Shakespeare, actor and renowned playwright, is contacted by 
Nicholas Skeres
 on behalf of members of an underground resistance movement who are plotting to overthrow the Spanish dominion of England and restore Elizabeth I to the throne. To do this, they employ Shakespeare himself, tasking him to write a play depicting the saga of 
Boudicca
, an ancient 
Iceni
 queen who rebelled against the 
Roman
 occupation of 
Great Britain
 in the 1st century A.D. The conspirators hope that the play will inspire its audience, Britons once again under the heel of a foreign enemy, to overthrow the Spanish.

The plan is complicated by the Spaniards who, also recognizing Shakespeare's talents, commission him to write a play depicting the life of King 
Philip II of Spain
 and the Spanish conquest of England. Now Shakespeare must write two plays—one glorifying the valor of England, the other glorifying its conquest and return to the Catholic Church—at the same time. There is also a subplot of the exploits of the skirt-chasing Spanish playwright and soldier 
Lope de Vega
, who is tasked by his superiors in the Spanish military hierarchy to keep an eye on Shakespeare and while he does so flirts from woman to woman. De Vega even acts in Shakespeare's 
King Philip
.

Despite danger at every turn from both the 
Spanish Inquisition
 and a home-grown English Inquisition, the secret play comes to fruition, and despite qualms from Shakespeare and his fellow players it is performed. As the conspirators had hoped, the audience is roused into an anti-Spanish fury and rampages through London, killing any Spanish official they see and freeing Elizabeth from the 
Tower of London
. Despite this victory and England's reclaimed freedom, there is considerable loss of life on both sides.

Shakespeare is rewarded by the reinstated Queen Elizabeth with a knighthood and an annulment of his unhappy marriage to 
Anne Hathaway
, which frees him to marry his longtime mistress. The queen also grants his daring request that his 
King Philip
 play, which he considers to contain some of his best work, be staged. At the end of the story, Shakespeare uses his new status to facilitate the release of his friend Lope de Vega from English captivity, provided that he immediately return to the Continent."

The novel opens with an Okeke man, Sunuteel, who finds an ancient cave of computers. His portable finds an open file and he starts listening to an audio file called ""The Book of Phoenix,"" which is called a ""memory extract.""  He becomes immersed in the story.

Phoenix is an accelerated biological organism who was created by LifeGen Technologies and lives in Tower 7 in 
Manhattan
 with other SpeciMen. She is told that her lover, Saeed, has committed suicide. Phoenix and Mmuo, her friend and another SpeciMen who can walk through walls, attempted to escape and destroy the tower, after freeing Seven, a mysterious winged man who appears to be a powerful SpeciMen, locked in a dome, hanging like the Hanging Man in the 
Tarot
. However, Phoenix is unable to escape and the Big Eyes catch her.  She explodes into fire like a bomb, killing everyone near her and knocking Tower 7 down, freeing everyone inside who is still alive.

It seems she dies, but she regenerates a few days later and is given an alien seed by the Backbone to return to 
Ghana
. Phoenix is being chased by the Big Eyes and while on the run she develops wings and with the aid of Seven flies to 
Wulugu
, Ghana where she secretly plants the seed.  Seven flies with her and teaches her how to ""slip,"" which is using time travel.  She can use this ability to go back in time.

In Ghana, she is given the name Okore and she lives peaceful with the residents. A year later the Big Eye shows up in Wulugu under the disguise of investors and shoots Kofi, her lover. She then explodes into fire, putting Kofi out of his misery and killing all nearby Big Eyes.

A reawakened Phoenix gives herself to the Big Eyes and is taken back to a tower in America. She escapes and reunites with Mmuo and Saeed. Saeed did not die of suicide, and instead awoke in a place where other dead SpeciMens are sent.  But he was created to survive, and he did.  Together the three of them destroy Tower 1, freeing all the inmates.

Phoenix is deemed a terrorist, but she still manages to get inside of the 
Library of Congress
,
 to learn more about the corporation, herself, her history, her friends and her mother before she heads to Tower 4 along with Saeed and Mmuo.

They successfully free the inmates and find HeLa, who is a SpeciMen who has the DNA that will produce blood that will make the recipient of it immortal.  That's what LifeGen Technologies is really doing: selling her blood to billionaires so they will live forever. There are 7 so far. Phoenix is attacked by the Big Eye at Tower 4. HeLa asks Phoenix to kill her so that she can escape her fate, and not provide immortality to any others, denying them the power of immortality. Phoenix burns and kills her and several Big Eye members before she dies. Phoenix regenerates and ""slips"" to take a trip to visit her surrogate mother just before the woman dies of cancer. Returning from the trip, she finds out that Mmuo is dead and Saeed has been taken away by the Big Eyes.

In a might of anger and rage she over heats like the sun and explodes, causing an apocalypse to fall on Earth. Saeed survives, which is what he was engineered to do, and leaves the deadland of America and walks to the ruins of West Africa. Using Phoenix' feather and a machine, he extracts her memory which is sent to an unknown database center, before placing it on his skin to extract his memory.  This is how The Book of Phoenix is preserved and told.

The novel ends with Sunuteel misinterpreting the Book of Phoenix on purpose and rewriting a wrong version of the story full of his own ideas which are used as the basis for the justification of the enslavement and oppression of the Okeke people by the Nuru people.  Because this is what he was always taught and he could not believe otherwise.  Another reason he changes the story was because he truth terrifies him after seeing Phoenix.

The epilogue is spoken by a mysterious white man.  He says that the story will continue, which points to the next book in the series, 
Who Fears Death

The book is about a 
solar geoengineering
 project conceived by a Texas oil-industry billionaire named T.R. Schmidt.
[
1
]
 Schmidt builds a launcher on the Texas-Mexico border to fire 
sulfur
 into the air, a form of 
stratospheric aerosol injection
 intended to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight into space.
[
2
]
 This technique replicates the effects of volcanic eruptions that inject sulfates into the atmosphere and produce global cooling, such as the 1991 
Mount Pinatubo eruption
.
[
3
]
 Schmidt's plan has uneven effects, helping low-lying areas such as the 
Netherlands
, 
Venice
, and the 
Maldives
, but threatening the 
Punjab
 with drought.
[
4
]


The main characters are Frederika Mathilde Louisa Saskia, the 
Queen of the Netherlands
,  and granddaughter of 
Queen Beatrix
;
[
5
]
 Rufus Grant, a part-
Comanche
 exterminator of 
feral hogs
; and Deep ""Laks"" Singh, a 
Punjab-Canadian
 
Sikh
.
[
6
]
 Saskia and Grant become entangled in Schmidt's plan, while Singh travels to the 
Line of Actual Control
 on the China-India border, where Chinese and Indian volunteers fight each other using non-lethal martial arts. Singh becomes a world-famous hero after several dramatic and well-promoted victories, but is felled by Chinese 
directed-energy weapons
.
[
6
]


Meanwhile, the Chinese government observes Schmidt's 
geoengineering
 efforts, and engages in advanced 
psychological warfare
, 
cyberwarfare
, and deadly 
tsunami bombs
 to shift European governments towards a pro-geoengineering stance. This also results in Saskia 
abdicating
 her throne for her daughter, after which she joins the growing consortium of smaller pro-geoengineering nations as the ""Queen of the Netherworld.""

In the climax of the book, Singh is sent with a team of 
drones
 on a covert mission by India, whose monsoons were delayed by Schmidt's geoengineering campaign, to destroy the Texas launcher. He is thwarted by Rufus, who takes action largely to protect Saskia, who is hiding in the launcher's subterranean shaft.

The book's title refers to the idea that once a solar geoengineering scheme begins, abruptly stopping it would result in rapid warming, called a 
termination shock
.

Veniss Underground
 alludes in several places to the myth of 
Orpheus
 and 
Eurydice
. Like Orpheus, Shadrach descends into the underworld to retrieve his love, Nicola, but here from a 
cyborg
 
hell
, where genetic engineering and DNA splicing create fantastic and horrific creatures. Parallels also exist with Dante's 
Inferno
. Throughout the novel the idea of heaven and hell come into play. Nick looks into the chaotic world in which he tries to find purpose through what is called living art. Nick journeys into the underworld and makes a deal with the ""devil"", also known as Quin. 

As the story progresses, the reader takes on the second person perspective of Nicola and is introduced to a meerkat whom Nicola names Salvador. Salvador (an assassin meerkat sent by Quin) attacks Nicola but she incapacitates him. Nick arrives at Nicola's door and chokes her till she is near death and sent to an organ bank in the underworld. Shadrach comes into play in the third person point of view and takes the initiative of finding his lost love Nicola in the underworld. He finds Salvador injured at Nicola's apartment and cuts off the meerkat's head and attaches it to a plate and renames him John the Baptist. 

After, with the help of Dr. Fergusen, he finds a partially mutilated Nicola in an organ bank under a pile of miscellaneous body parts guarded by a naked troll. He carries Nicola through the tunnels back to his childhood home and finds a creation of Quin named Candle. Candle leads Nick to the Psyche witch named Rafter. After Rafter decides to try to salvage Nicola, Shadrach takes the action of venturing deeper into the underworld to kill Quin. He finds Nick, now transformed into a piece of living art, being attacked by some in the garbage re-cycling facility. Nick takes Shadrach lower and tells him how to get to Quin by jumping off a moving train with a parachute. Nick pushes Shadrach out of the train only to be shot by Shadrach as he falls. 

Shadrach manages to open his chute yet he hits the ground hard. Later, he wakes by a beach and an ocean and kicks over a skull where he finds another creation of Quin's called the Gollux. The Gollux tells him the truth while John the Baptist lies, the Gollux leads Shadrach to a ray-like creature named the saylber which Shadrach rides across the ocean and into Quin's world which is actually a very large minnow named the leviathan. 

He kills Quin and the remote and the whole place explodes. Shadrach climbs up the cliffs back to the subway level. Shadrach retrieves Nicola and takes her to the surface where they are both on a bridge staring at the city which is called Veniss.

 Edwin travels to Caiette, a fictional settlement (which also appeared in Mandel's previous novel 
The Glass Hotel
) on the sparsely-inhabited 
Vancouver Island
.

 Venturing into a forest, Edwin is overwhelmed by momentarily experiencing being within a vast, dark space, hearing a violin and other sounds he cannot recognize. A stranger named Roberts, claiming to be a priest (but is in fact the same time traveler introduced later in the novel), questions him about this experience, but flees when Edwin becomes suspicious.

book tour
.

 His prodigy sister, Zoey, who followed in their late mother's footsteps as a physicist, confides in him her research into Edwin, Vincent, and Olive's experiences of having swapped places, impossibly, across centuries.
[

 Zoey believes that this anomaly supports the 
simulation hypothesis
, their mother's field of research, if it represents 
data corruption
 in the simulation.

Zoey admits that she works, under strict secrecy, at the Time Institute, a government agency wielding sole legal authority over 
time travel
, which will officially investigate this anomaly. Impatient to escape his humdrum life, and despite warnings about the institute's ruthless bureaucracy, Gaspery-Jacques discovers a mutual friend at the Institute who eagerly recruits him to join the investigation.

After uneventfully interviewing Alan Sami, an elderly man who played the violin in Oklahoma City Airship Terminal, Gaspery-Jacques interviews Olive, also learning little. Knowing that she is about to die during an imminent global pandemic, he defies protocols and warns her to return home immediately. Trusting his warning, Olive avoids her fate and safely reunites with her family as the pandemic erupts.

Zoey urges Gaspery-Jacques to go on the lam, but he persuades her to help him continue investigating the anomaly, incriminating herself as well. He witnesses the anomaly at the same time as Vincent, then travels to 1918 to accomplish his true goal: to personally assure Edwin of his sanity, saving him from being committed to an insane asylum.

  Gaspery-Jacques's punishment is carried out by forced time-travel to 20th-century Ohio, where, at the murder scene that Mirella witnessed, he is framed and left to be arrested and sentenced to life in prison.

Years later, Zoey, who has joined another organization with time travel technology, saves a sixty-year-old Gaspery-Jacques from his incarceration, bringing him to safe lodging near Oklahoma City in 2172. To evade the Time Institute, he receives a new identity and facial surgery, becoming Alan Sami. He realizes that he himself will cause the anomaly by the meeting of his past and future selves at the spaceport.

The novel takes place inside and on the exterior of a 
megastructural
 cylindrical building called Cylinder, which one character says ""violates at least a dozen laws of physics."" It is not explained how this building can exist, or why it was built or by whom.
[

]


The novel begins with Ny Axxter, a ""graffex"" (
graphic designer
) on the exterior surface of the building trying to make a living as a freelancer, selling content to Ask & Receive, an information repository and apparent 
monopoly
.

Axxter discovers a location where the exterior of the building has been blown out by an explosion and the interior rooms are full of corpses. He attributes this to 
bogeymen
 called the Dead Centers that live in the sealed off center sections of Cylinder.

Axxter gets a job working for one of the warrior tribes that inhabit the exterior of the building, redesigning their graphical branding identity. But the big reveal is hacked, apparently by the company that previously designed the tribe's graphics, embarrassing the tribe and leading to Axxter fleeing for his life.

Aided by a gas angel (a humanoid with a large gas bag growing out of its back so it can float in the atmosphere around the building) Axxter ends up on the far side of Cylinder. Axxter hatches a plan to travel through the center of the building back home, and to report on his odyssey as a form of entertainment for residents of Cylinder.

Along the way Axxter meets and is aided by a hacker who can move between bodies stashed in different parts of the building, and a Dead Center who teaches Axxter about an alternate information source to Ask & Receive.

Axxter learns that the destruction of the site that he discovered at the start of the novel was not done by the Dead Centers, but instead by a collaboration between the two most powerful warrior tribes on the building, enabled by doctored information from Ask & Receive. Axxter broadcasts this information to the entire building, leading to the collapse of the dominant power structure of Cylinder.

 Fifteen-year-old Caitlin Decter has been blind from birth. The Decter family recently moved from 
Austin, Texas
 to 
Waterloo, Ontario
 after Caitlin's father, Malcolm, received a job at the 
Perimeter Institute
. Caitlin is emailed by Dr. Masayuki Kuroda, a scientist specializing in ""signal processing related to 
V1
."" He believes that her blindness is caused by her retinas miscoding the visual information and offers to install a signal processor behind her left eye to unscramble the data. The device sends the data to a miniature computer, or ""eyePod"", which reprocesses the signals and returns them. The correct data is sent to her optic nerve, theoretically granting her sight. In duplex mode it sends and receives the signals, and in simplex mode it only sends them. Caitlin and her mother, Barbara, fly to Tokyo for the procedure. Although her pupils now react to light, Caitlin still cannot see. They return to Canada while Dr. Kuroda works on updating the software.

A bird-flu epidemic with a mortality rate of at least 90% has begun in China. Dr. Quan Li, a senior member of the 
Communist Party
, recommends the President order a culling of ten to eleven thousand people in the infected area with an airborne chemical. The President agrees and launches the Changcheng Strategy, cutting off all telephone, satellite, and wireless communication with the rest of the world, so that word of the culling does not spread beyond China's borders. Wong Wai-Jeng, a freedom blogger who is known online as 
Sinanthropus
, attempts to circumvent 
Internet censorship in China
 along with many other hackers. Collectively they learn about the bird flu outbreak. Many days after enacting the Changcheng Strategy, Zhang Bo, the Minister of Communications, convinces the President to restore communications. The moment they are back up, Sinanthropus posts a blog, informing the world of the bird flu outbreak and the culling. He is tracked down by the police and, while attempting to flee, breaks his leg and is captured.

The first software update Kuroda attempts is a partial success. Although Caitlin can still not see the outside world, it enables her to visualize the 
World Wide Web
 while the update downloads when the eyePod is in duplex mode. Dr. Kuroda speculates that the data being transmitted between the eyePod and his server in Tokyo is being interpreted by her optic nerve, allowing her to see this. He decides to travel to Waterloo to work with Caitlin on the implant more directly. In the interim, he suggests sending the retinal feed from her eyePod to his Tokyo server through Jagster, a fictional search engine,
[
2
]
 so that he can monitor how she reacts to different inputs. He dubs her ability to visualize the internet ""websight"". Caitlin notes that, along with websites and links, she can visualize a background in websight that looks like a chess board. Dr. Kuroda speculates that the background is made up of 
cellular automata
, which Caitlin suggests is caused by corrupted 
packet loss
. Several 
Zipf plots
 are run of the cellular automata, which has a negative one slope. The Decters, Dr. Kuroda, and Anna Bloom, a network cartographer, realize that means the cellular automata contain intelligent content, which Anna suggests is secret communications from the 
National Security Agency
. They decide to keep investigating the cellular automata discreetly.

In San Diego, California, Shoshana Glick, an ape-language researcher and graduate student, works at the Marcuse Institute, a primate research centre. Hobo, a 
chimpanzee
-
bonobo
 
hybrid
, communicates by sign language. Doctor Harl Marcuse, the owner of the Institute, sets up a connection with the Miami Zoo. Hobo communicates with an 
orangutan
 named Virgil in the first interspecies 
webcam call
. The Marcuse Institute and Miami Zoo agree to announce the chat jointly, but the Miami Zoo leaks word of it to 
New Scientist
, who go to the Georgia Zoo – Hobo's birthplace – for information on him. Georgia Zoo, fearing about the contamination between the captive chimpanzee and bonobo bloodlines, demand Hobo be returned to them so that he can be sterilized. Hobo paints a portrait of Shoshana, surprising everyone at the Institute as it had been believed that chimpanzees could only paint abstractly. Dr. Marcuse theorizes that the communication with Virgil had shown Hobo ""how three-dimensional objects could be reduced to two dimensions."" The Marcuse Institute decide to record Hobo painting a second time and then go public, believing that the outcry over sterilizing him would force the Georgia Zoo to back down from their plans. The Georgia Zoo issues a lawsuit, planning to castrate Hobo.

Dr. Kuroda sets up a final software patch. While at school, Caitlin decides to take a break from her work and switches the eyePod to duplex mode so she can look through websight. It fails to load and, disappointed, she returns the eyePod to simplex mode. She sees several lines crossing her field of vision and is surprised when she realizes that they are the edge of a lab bench and that she can now see. Barbara picks Caitlin up from school and informs her about the patch. Malcolm runs 
Shannon entropy
 graphs on the cellular automata to gauge how complex the information in them is. He shows Caitlin how to run it, and they discover that the information has little complexity. Dr. Kuroda holds a press conference, announcing the success of his invention that has made Caitlin able to see. Caitlin receives an electric shock which crashes the eyePod. She reboots it in duplex mode and sees a mirrored representation of her face in websight.

An intelligence has spontaneously emerged on the Web. Cleaved in two when the Changcheng Strategy was enacted, the restoration of communications by China causes the two halves to coalesce, and it gains in intelligence. The intelligence can view Caitlin's eyePod feed. It believes that her vision is an attempt to communicate with it and, when her eyePod was rebooted, it sent an image of Caitlin in an attempt to communicate back. As Caitlin begins to learn how to read letters, the intelligence believes it is a further attempt to communicate and learns with her. When she switches to duplex mode, it takes that act to be a reward for its learning progress. Caitlin believes it to be ""visual noise"" as a result of gaining sight. Dr. Kuroda looks at the information on his server, and Caitlin realizes that the information is her reading exercises being bounced back to her. She then runs another Shannon entropy scan, realising that the information in the cellular automata has increased in intelligence. Caitlin deduces that the information is trying to communicate with her and decides to help it. Dr. Kuroda feels it is now time to return to Japan and informs her that, as she can now see, he will remove the duplex setting from her eyePod. Caitlin convinces him to keep it as is so that she can continue to see websight. She runs another Shannon entropy plot and realizes that the intelligence has increased yet again. She continues with her teaching efforts, leading the intelligence to different websites so that it can continue learning. She runs the Shannon entropy a fourth and fifth time and finds that the intelligence is double that of human complexity.

The intelligence contacts Caitlin via email and wishes her a happy birthday. It thanks her for helping it to learn and invites her to communicate with it through instant messenger. She asks it what she should call it, and the intelligence replies ""Webmind"". Webmind and Caitlin decide to go forwards together.

The third part of the trilogy, 
Helliconia Winter
 is set during late autumn in the northern continent, Sibornal. The book's protagonist, Luterin Shokerandit, is the son of the Keeper of the Wheel of Kharnabar, located above the far north of Helliconia. The Wheel is an extraordinary revolving monastery/prison built into a ring-shaped tunnel with a single entrance and exit, powered entirely by the efforts of the prisoners pulling it along by means of chains set into the outer wall. Once a prisoner enters a cell of the Wheel, it is impossible for him to leave until its full ten-year rotation has passed.

Luterin joins the army, where he gains renown by killing the commandant of an enemy battalion, taking his widow Toress Lahl as a slave. Soon, however, the first cases of Fat Death begin to appear in the Sibornalese army. The Oligarch, autocratic ruler of Sibornal, orders other troops to destroy this army in an attempt to halt the spread of the epidemic. Luterin is warned by Captain Fashnalgid in time for the two of them to escape with Toress Lahl and a foreign trader who has arranged for a ship to flee the area. While the ship is at sea, the Fat Death spreads among those aboard; however, thanks to the skills of Toress Lahl, who was trained as a doctor, the major characters survive. It is during this voyage that a great deal of information is discovered about the deep past of the Helliconia-Batalix solar system, its capture by Freyr, and the intertwined fates of humans and phagors.

After the ship lands, the Oligarch's army continues to pursue the deserters. They go on the run again, hiring a dog-sledge with a semi-human driver and his phagor slave in order to cross the mountains. Fashnalgid mortally offends their driver by sleeping with his wife, and the driver retaliates by arranging for his phagor to push Fashnalgid off the sledge while they are travelling through a dangerous tunnel. Luterin tries to save Fashnalgid, but also falls from the sledge. He is forced to walk for miles through the polar cold until he eventually rejoins the sledge and is able to travel the rest of the way to his father's estate.

Once home, Luterin proclaims that he wishes to marry Toress Lahl rather than his arranged noble bride, and gives Toress the key to an ancient shrine. A few days later, he expresses hatred for the Oligarch who ordered his army to be destroyed. From his father's reactions, he realises that his father is in fact the Oligarch. Luterin kills his father and flees to the Wheel of Kharnabar; he enters the Wheel and therefore remains in solitary confinement for ten years. When he at last emerges, he finds that the assassination of the former Oligarch is now seen as a positive event.

A party is arranged to celebrate Luterin's freedom and also to observe the day of Myrkwyr, when Freyr is seen for the last time, marking the beginning of the centuries-long great winter. After the festivities, the Master of Kharnabar has Luterin seized, with the intent of throwing him back into the Wheel. For phagors, Myrkwyr indicates the return of conditions favourable to their kind, and a phagor tribe makes plans to regain their dominance over humans. The phagors attack the party; Luterin escapes in the confusion and is reunited with Toress Lahl. The book ends as they leave for the shrine, where she has been living in hiding with their now ten-year-old son."

Told in alternating, non-chronological chapters, the novel is separated into three parts: ""Winter Kitchen"", ""Summer Kitchen"", and ""Oz Circle"". The story follows three characters, each connected to the story of 
The Wizard of Oz,
 and how they are all connected to one another without even realizing it.

The primary focus is on Jonathan, a gay actor with 
AIDS
 who goes on a obsessed pilgrimage of sorts to 
Manhattan, Kansas
, in search of the ""real"" Dorothy. 

Other portions of the novel explore the tragic life of ""Dorothy Gael"" in 1800s Kansas, whose traumatic experiences with Aunt Emily and Uncle Henry after her mother's death leads her to create an imaginary and idealized world in her mind based on some of her real-life experiences as a way of coping with her bleak reality. Unlike Baum's fairy tale book, she never gets to experience the magic of Oz, thus turning her into an insane and bitter old woman.

The novel follows the protagonist, Onyesonwu (
Igbo
 for ""who fears death""), who is an 
Ewu
, i.e. the child of an Okeke woman raped by a Nuru man. On reaching 
maturity
, she goes on a quest to defeat her sorcerous father Daib using her 
magical powers
. The novel is narrated by Onyesonwu to a journalist who interviews her before her execution. It is divided into three parts.



Part I
[
edit
]


The novel opens with the death of Onyesonwu's Father, which occurs when Onyesonwu was sixteen. The plot shifts back to her arrival in Jwahir. Onyesonwu  is a product of rape, her mother Najeeba's was raped alongside other Okeke women by a Nuru man when her village was attacked and destroyed by the Nurus.

Onyesonwu grows up in Jwahir after spending six years in the desert alone with her mother. She does not fit with the town people and is often ostracized because she is an Ewu. Onye meets a blacksmith named Fadil Ogundimu who treats her well, and eventually marries her mother.  Onyesonwu undergoes female circumcision at eleven in an attempt to become normal and accepted by the community against her parents wishes, giving her biological father the chance to haunt her. She bonds closely with the three other girls who undergo the rites, Binta, Diti, and Luyu. Soon after the rite, an Ewu boy named Mwita arrives at school. Mwita and Onyesonwu befriends each other because of their shared status and shared powers, but Onyesonwu is skeptical about him because Mwita is trained by Aro, the local sorcerer, who refuses to coach her because she is a girl. After Onyesonwu father's burial Aro decides to coach her.



Part II
[
edit
]


Onyesonwu's return to school days later after her father's death. She goes through a terrifying initiation which is literally her own death. She bonds with Mwita and develops her powers of shape shifting, resurrecting creatures, traveling to the ‘wilderness’ (spirit world) and she regrows her clitoris.

Onyesonwu's apprenticeship ends when she is mocked at the market and uses her abilities to make the mockers relive her mother's rape. After this, she leaves Jwahir and moves to help the Okeke in the west of the desert. Mwita, Binta, Diti, Luyu, and Diti's fiancé Fanasi decide to travel with her. On the way, Onyesonwu asks for direction to find the Nuru man prophesied by a Seer to rewrite the Great Book and she discovers that it was she who has been prophesied to rewrite the Great Book which justifies the oppression of the Okeke people and stop the Nuru attack in the west. The Seer was afraid to admit that an Ewu woman will change everything so he switched the race and gender.



Part III
[
edit
]


Tension grows among the group due to the harshness of the desert and Luyu and Fanasi begin to have an affair after Onyesonwu regrows her friends clitoris despite Fanasi's betrothal to Diti. They reach a supply town where Onyesonwu and Mwita are stoned because of their Ewu status and Binta is killed in the process. Onyesonwu, out of rage, blinds everyone in the town. After Binta's death, they encounter the Vah, a tribe who travels in the sandstorm. The Vah invites the group to stay with them for the three weeks they plan on remaining there. Onyesonwu discusses with the goddess Ani and she meets a Kponyungo (dragon like creature) who takes her to the east. Onyesonwu's spirit travels to the west and attacks Diab but Diab uses an evil juju to poison her.

Diti and Fanasi return to Jwahir after the Vah sorcerers heal Onyesonwu and the others continue on their journey. Onyesonwu, Luyu and Mwita reach ruined Okeke villages and people and Onyesonwu heals the sick among them. They reach Durfa, where Onyesonwu attacks Diab and Mwita is killed by him. Onyesonwu uses her ability to move one of her eggs towards Mwita's sperm causing an explosion which injures Diab and eventually leads to his death.

Luyu and Onyesonwu discover that the blast killed all fertile men around the region and impregnated all the fertile women. They both flee to an island where Onyesonwu finds the Great Book. She rewrites it with a magical script called 
Nsibidi
. The remaining Nuru men reach the island, kill Luyu and take Onyesonwu prisoner.

The epilogue, narrated by a Nuru who interviewed Onyesonwu, asserts that she was stoned to death and explains how he worked with his sister to dig her body. While a narration of the last two chapters by Sola describes Onyesonwu escaping execution by transforming into a Kponyungo and flying east to meet Mwita."

Recovering from his near-fatal Moon-run escape through vacuum, Lucas Corta has only one source of potential allies to reclaim his empire: Earth. But as those who have lived on the Moon for an extended period are physically incapable of surviving on Earth, he enlists Dr. Galina Volikova to help him overcome this obstacle on the Vorontsov orbiting cycler 
Saints Peter and Paul
. Months later he makes the journey, knowing a stay longer than four months will kill him. While making connections on Earth, Lucas meets his cousin Alexia Corta, and enlists her as an ally in his plan to reclaim the Corta empire.

Eighteen months after the destruction of the Cortas, the triumphant Mackenzie family gathers for the 105th birthday celebration of patriarch Robert on their smelting train Crucible, which perpetually follows the 
Sun
. The facility's mirror array suddenly turns on itself, and though key members of the family and their guests escape, almost two hundred of the partygoers are incinerated as the compound is destroyed within minutes. Robert himself is left to die by his wife Jade Sun, whom he manages to kill before he perishes. Surviving the catastrophe, the Sun matriarch Cixi takes Jade and Robert's son Darius Mackenzie under her protection. Robert's son Bryce Mackenzie learns that Crucible's destruction was caused by a 
Trojan horse
 planted decades before, and connects it to the Cortas. Robson Corta, the orphaned son of Rachel Mackenzie and Rafa Corta who has been living as a veritable Mackenzie hostage, flees Bryce's revenge and joins his uncle, Wagner Corta, in hiding.

In the wake of Robert's death, Bryce seizes control of the Mackenzie helium-3 operations at João de Deus, formerly Corta property, and establishes Mackenzie Helium. His elder brother Duncan solidifies his hold on Mackenzie Metals and reopens the only remaining smelter on the Moon, the original Mackenzie facility at Hadley. Bryce's blades decimate one of Duncan's work crews, nearly killing Duncan's son Denny. Citing Corta honor, Wagner rescues Denny even though he murdered Wagner's brother Carlinhos. As payback, Denny agrees to protect Robson while Wagner is away. Bryce's knives come for Robson, and though Denny and his people intervene, Robson flees.

Paralyzed from the waist down, Ariel Corta is in hiding but performs legal work remotely. Her bodyguard Marina Calzaghe's ""Moonday""—when she must decide whether to return to Earth before the Moon's changes to her body are irreversible, or stay on the Moon permanently—is approaching. With the LDC board turning against him, Jonathan Kayode hires Ariel as his legal advisor, knowing that her current lack of family and business alliances makes her the only person he can trust. Without warning Ariel, Jonathan seizes control of the LDC and arrests its board members. Ariel meets with Lady Sun, Lousika Asamoah, and Duncan Mackenzie to confirm whether they will position their families with or against Jonathan. She seeks out banker Vidhya Rao, whom she believes can give her insight into the Vorontsovs, who have gone quiet. Ariel is shocked to learn that the Vorontsovs have begun a brutal coup of their own.

Wagner and his team of surface workers encounter an Asamoah farming facility seemingly crippled by malfunctioning Vorontsov moon-dozers, who are now heading in the direction of the Asamoah city of Twé. The inhabitants of the facility have been assassinated by robots who now pursue Wagner's rover; he loses two teammates, but the survivors rendezvous with a rescue team. With his father Lucas missing and presumed dead, Lucasinho Corta is living under the protection of the Asamoahs in Twé. An attack disables the city's fusion reactor and the dozers begin covering the domes of Twé with surface 
regolith
 to render its solar panels useless. Lucasinho flees the city with his nine-year-old cousin Luna, daughter of Rafa and Lousika, but their transport pod is stranded at a remote relay station due to a lack of power. Lucasinho finds a rover, and their journey toward João de Deus is fraught with danger. Running out of energy and air, Luna and an unconscious Lucasinho find refuge in the destroyed subterranean Corta mansion, Boa Vista.

Aided by the Vorontsovs, the Lunar Mandate Authority of Earth has seized control of the Moon. In Meridian, Jonathan is assassinated, and Marina returns to Earth. Ariel is summoned by the mastermind behind the brutal takeover: her brother Lucas. Duncan seeks Robson as leverage against Lucas, but Denny lets the boy flee with Wagner, and is exiled by Duncan. Lucas reclaims Boa Vista."

Planetfall
 takes place an unspecific number of years into the future. Twenty years before the beginning of the novel, Renata Ghali (Ren) befriends Lee Suh-Mi (Suh) when both women intend to rent the same apartment in 
Paris
. They become fast friends, and Ren falls in love with Suh. While they hike in the Alps, Suh eats a seed from an unidentified plant and falls into a coma. Suh is deeply changed upon awakening, and writes down the location of a planet from which she claims God is calling to her.

Suh recruits 1,000 people for an expedition to the planet, including wealthy marketing executive Cillian Mackenzie (Mac), Suh's son Lee Hak-Kun, and Ren as the chief 3-D printer engineer. The expedition constructs a spaceship called Atlas and travels through space to the unnamed planet. A small group including Suh, Ren, Mac, and Hak-Kun land first and explore a large bio-mechanical alien structure they call ""God's City"". At the top of the structure, Suh disappears into a room, then returns minutes later in tears claiming that God has died. She removes her helmet and is immediately killed by the toxic air inside God's City.

With Suh's status as ""Pathfinder"" vital to keeping the colony together, Mac decides to tell everyone that Suh remained in God's City to commune with God. The advance party returns to Atlas, where Hak-Kun disagrees with Mac and prepares to tell everyone about Suh's death. To protect the secret, Mac sabotages Hak-Kun's pod during the second planetfall, apparently killing him and his followers. With Ren sworn to secrecy, Mac establishes a colony at the foot of God's City, and institutes an annual ritual in which the colonists gather to await Suh's return."

Following the events of 
Tiamat's Wrath
, the mysterious ""dark gods"" or ""ring entities"" have been experimenting with methods to kill humans in various ways, including adjusting the principles of physics in some systems, and launching their loss-of-consciousness attacks. Winston Duarte suddenly awakens from his semi-catatonic state with newfound knowledge about the Ring-Builders, and new abilities, including being able to project a vision of himself into other people's minds. He projects himself into the mind of Admiral Trejo, who is currently reconquering the Sol system for the Laconian Empire. Duarte expresses gratitude for Trejo's efforts in preserving the Empire and admits they had been thinking too small in their empire-building vision. Duarte then vanishes, prompting Trejo to order a return to Laconia. Upon arrival, Duarte has already disappeared from the state building, and Colonel Aliana Tanaka is tasked to locate him with the highest possible level of security clearance.

Tanaka's search leads her to the cave Amos Burton once inhabited, where she deduces that Duarte left Laconia in a small alien ship. She decides to use Teresa Duarte, who had fled Laconia with the crew of the 
Rocinante
 in 
Tiamat's Wrath
, as bait to lure Winston. She begins her search for Teresa by investigating Duarte's known relatives in various ring systems. Meanwhile, Elvi and her team, along with the protomolecule-resurrected children Xan and Cara, are investigating the Adro Diamond, a Ring-Builder record keeping device. The team uses the protomolecule to activate the diamond, which then communicates with Cara through her enhancements to show her the history of the Ring-Builder civilization. The Ring-Builders were sea-slug like creatures that evolved under the ice of a 
Europa
-like water world, and eventually evolved beyond their physical bodies and into a hive mind, able to communicate faster than the speed of light. Some of Cara's experiences bleed into Amos, who has been similarly altered.

Meanwhile, the 
Rocinante
 crew (Jim, Naomi, Alex, Amos, and Teresa) are avoiding Laconian ships while Naomi manages the underground resistance. They transit to the colony world of New Egypt to take Teresa to a boarding school near her relatives, but they find Tanaka and a team of Laconian marines already waiting for them. After a firefight, they escape to the 
Rocinante
 and flee to the Freehold system, the location of the underground's base, Draper Station. However, Laconian forces are already present when they arrive, and suspicious of the disguised ship, alert Tanaka. As the 
Rocinante
 covertly resupplies at Draper Station, Tanaka arrives in the system and delivers a message from Trejo to Naomi. The message offers an armistice and alliance between the Laconian Empire and the underground, implementing Naomi's gate travel protocols, and the withdrawal of Laconian forces from Freehold. In return, he simply wants them to return Teresa. The crew deems Trejo's demands unreasonable, but resistance member Jillian Houston takes matters into her own hands, locking the 
Rocinante
 crew in their quarters and accepting the Laconian offer. Tanaka, however, has no intention of honoring the deal and kills Jillian's guards before searching Draper Station for Teresa.

Jillian releases the 
Rocinante
 crew, who launch and escape through the ring gate, while the 
Gathering Storm
 sacrifices itself to cover their retreat. A particularly devastating dark god attack eradicates all but the most basic life forms in one system, sparking mass fear that the dark gods have figured out how to eradicate humanity as they had the Ring-Builders. Amos convinces the crew to head to the Adro system to meet Elvi and aid in the investigation of the diamond. Tanaka, losing the 
Rocinante's
 trail, mistakenly follows another ship to the Bara Gaon system. During her search, a large colony ship enters the ring space from the Sol system too soon after another transit. The ship begins to vanish, but it is saved by an unknown force. This event causes the rings to glow brightly and triggers those in the slow zone and aboard the ship to begin to experience shared memories. After this, the attacks by the dark gods cease in all systems.

When the 
Rocinante
 finally reaches the Adro system, they decide to perform a dual dive into the alien device with Cara and Amos. During this process, the vision of Duarte appears to Elvi and Holden, proposing that humanity must join him in creating a hive mind to counter the ring entities' attacks, just as the Ring-Builders had. The mind-melding and shared memories experienced by those in the slow zone begin to spread like a virus throughout humanity, and the crew of the 
Rocinante
 realizes that Duarte is starting his plan of gradually converting humanity into a hive mind. Following the dual dive, Amos convinces Elvi to cease the dives with Cara for ethical reasons. Meanwhile, Tanaka, troubled by the shared memory experience, seeks psychiatric help and receives medication to mitigate the issue. She learns that Laconian scientists believe they have found Duarte's alien ship on the surface of the Ring Station, and both the 
Rocinante
 crew and Tanaka decide to head there. Naomi sends Trejo a message accepting his earlier offer and providing the data from the dual dive experiment, while simultaneously sharing the information with the underground resistance and urging them to send ships to the Ring Space. Trejo orders Tanaka to either retrieve Duarte or assume control. As more ships arrive into the Ring Space, some lose contact as Duarte gains control of their crews through his burgeoning hive mind.

Upon arrival in the slow zone, Tanaka, Teresa, and Amos perform a dive to attempt to open the Ring Station that angers Duarte. Seeing no other options, Jim injects himself with a live sample of the protomolecule, dooming himself to its slow death. For the first time in more than three decades, the protomolecule induced vision of Joe Miller appears to Holden, just as he had hoped it would. Miller helps open the Ring Station, and Holden, Tanaka, and Teresa enter to find and stop Duarte. Meanwhile, a massive space battle unfolds in the slow zone, as the joint underground and Laconian fleets desperately try to buy Holden and Tanaka time despite heavy fire from Duarte's hive mind controlled ships. While they journey through the station, Miller explains that the Ring-Builders had discovered that the universe existed alongside a much older parallel reality, and built the slow zone within this alternate realm, using the immense energy of the other dimension to power the gates. However, stealing energy from this dimension to allow for the travel of ships through the rings hurt the alternate dimension's mysterious inhabitants, the dark gods, leading them to attack the Ring-Builders, and now humanity. Reaching the center of the ring station, the team finds Duarte connected to the station, creating his hive mind and stalling the dark gods attacks.

Teresa's attempts to convince Duarte to stop his hive mind fail, and Tanaka kills him, simultaneously ending the hive mind and unleashing the dark gods on humanity. In the ensuing struggle, Tanaka is also killed. Jim realizes what he must do in order to save humanity. He connects himself to the station, taking Duarte's place, and holds the dark gods at bay while Teresa escapes the Ring Station and orders the remaining ships to exit the slow zone. After an emotional goodbye, the crew of the 
Rocinante
 splits for the final time after decades of flying together. Alex takes the 
Rocinante
 to Nieuwestadt system to live with his son and grandchild, while Amos, Naomi, and Teresa travel with Elvi back to Sol. Once the slow zone is empty, Jim destroys the Ring Station, sacrificing himself, but severing the dark gods' connection to the human universe and causing the ring gates to collapse. Each of the 1,300 colony systems, now unable to communicate with the others, is left to fend for itself.

In an epilogue set 1,000 years later, humans have developed their own form of 
faster-than-light
 travel. A team from The Thirty Worlds, a federation of colonies, journeys to Earth, where they are greeted by Amos Burton."

With electricity and telecommunications links down, petroleum increasingly scarce and with water supplies of unknown potability, former 
Concord
 police detective Henry Palace is in a race with time. As the apocalypse approaches, individuals are abandoning their former professional and vocational responsibilities to pursue various personalized ""bucket lists"" of preferred activities, but despite his redundancy from the nationalized Concord Police Department, Palace still intends to fulfill his duty to Martha and Brett Cavatone. As the U.S. economy is dismantled, Concord is full of empty storefronts, while remaining police protect citizens from their feral apocalyptic fellow inhabitants.

Henry and Nico, his sister, travel to the former 
University of New Hampshire
 (which has now ""seceded"" from what used to be the United States), in search of Brett. One member of the UNH student ""free republic"" government, Julia Stone, is engaged in firearms transactions. Eventually, Palace finds Brett in a small community near

 and tries to persuade him to return to his wife. Remnant cutters from the 
U.S. Coast Guard
, assisted by the U.S. Navy, are attempting to prevent refugees and illegal immigrants from the eastern hemisphere and the vicinity of the impact zone from entering into the contiguous United States, using deadly force, which disturbs Palace, who witnesses refugees at sea being killed by them. It also emerges that Martha was having an extramarital affair and that her estranged husband abandoned the relationship for that reason.

Brett Cavatone is shot and killed by a sniper, who shoots Palace as well, injuring him. Although Palace is injured, he is flown to Concord by an SH-60 helicopter, where Concord medical staff are still maintaining healthcare services. It turns out Jeremy, a coworker of Brett's, killed him because he wanted Martha for himself, even faking evidence of an affair. He later dies of an overdose. As for Martha, she and her father Rocky are enmeshed in a fraud promising miraculous escape from the impending cataclysm. It is presumed that they died in the riot that occurred in Concord after the water is shut off.  However, Nico Palace is also pursuing a nostrum of her own- the use of nuclear deterrence against 2011GV1, which sets up the core scenario for the final book in the trilogy,

Robert Luczak is sent by the American 
literary magazine
 
Other Voices,
 where he works as an editor, to 
Calcutta
 to locate 
poetry
 alleged to have been recently authored by a legendary poet, M. Das.  The literary world considers this development newsworthy because Das disappeared and is presumed to have died eight years ago.  Robert's Indian wife, Amrita, and their infant child, Victoria, accompany him on his assignment.

Upon arriving, he is met by a Mr. M. T. Krishna, a local intellectual who claims to have been asked to assist them by a mutual friend. The next day Robert meets with the local writers guild who were the source of the few bits of poetry that made their way to America. When he asks to meet Das, he is told this is impossible. Robert considers leaving Calcutta at this point, his duty done, but feels that he doesn't yet have enough material for an interesting article. The night before he and his family are to leave, Krishna returns and takes Robert to a man who can provide him with information relevant to his story.

The man tells how he and a friend tried to join a religious 
secret society
 dedicated to 
Kali
, the 
Hindu
 goddess associated with death and destruction.  One of the 
prerequisites
 was for each initiate to bring a corpse to a secret temple, there to be laid at the feet of a statue of Kali.  One of the corpses, 
bloated and decayed
 after being dredged from the river, is chosen by Kali, vivified by her, and reanimates; this corpse is said to be that of the poet, Das.

Robert finds the man's tale too fantastical to believe, and still hopes to meet and interview the poet.  While he is not granted an interview with Das, Robert receives an extensive manuscript collection of Das' poetry, which is very different from his earlier work, describing dark, 
mystical
, 
grotesque
, and 
apocalyptic
 happenings.

Robert again insists that the writers guild allow him to see Das, and threatens to call them and the manuscript a fraud in his article. This time they agree. He is brought through the Calcutta slums by gangsters belonging to the cult of Kali, and taken to the poet. Shocked by the man’s appearance, Robert first takes him for a reanimated corpse, but then recognizes the symptoms as the advanced stages of 
leprosy
.  Das confirms that he is suffering from the affliction, but also insists that he really did return from death. Robert is unconvinced, feeling Das may be going along with the cult members who might be holding him captive. Das then asks him to bring him books of poetry, making a reference to a certain poem about a 
suicide
 to hint that he really wants the means to kill himself.

Becoming concerned at the eerie and sometimes frightening events that he has experienced, Robert attempts to send his wife and child home, but they are unable to get a flight. Concealing a gun (given to him previously by Krishna) in one of the books he has bought for Das, he returns to the poet. Robert leaves the books and departs, but, as he exits the house, hears two gunshots. Das is dead. Robert is captured by guards and drugged. He awakens to find himself in a temple of Kali, where the statue of the goddess seems to come to life and attack him (though it is left deliberately ambiguous as to whether this actually happens, or is instead a hallucination). He is loaded into the back of a truck by the cultists to be taken somewhere, but manages to escape with Krishna's help. He returns to the hotel, only to find his wife informing the police that their daughter has been kidnapped.

After a couple of days of dead-end leads, an Indian couple is caught at the airport trying to take someone resembling Victoria out of the country. Robert and Amrita go to identify their child, but find that she is already 
dead
.

With their child dead, and no hope of finding the perpetrators of the crime nor bringing them to justice, Robert and his wife return to America. Robert decides to destroy the poetry, and, gradually, the couple's relationship returns to something resembling normal. Robert still wrestles with the desire for revenge, and after training himself in the use of firearms he returns to Calcutta with a smuggled handgun, intending to track down and kill everyone he considers responsible. At the last moment, however, he manages to resist what he believes to be the ""Song of Kali"" - the force of devastation, cruelty and madness that exists somewhere within every human heart. He returns to the US and successfully comes to terms with the events that have befallen him and his family.

Whispers can still be heard, though, of the ""Song of Kali"", the condition of humanity dominated by hatred and violence, perfectly embodied, in the mind of the narrator, by the squalor and chaos of Calcutta."

The futuristic novel is set mostly upon Prokaryon (“The Children Star”), a world with highly different biological foundations than ours.

In the beginning of the novel, the orphaned toddler ’jum G’hana (‘pig urine’) is rescued from pandemic-ravaged Reyo on the world L'li by Brother Rod, who takes her first to a satellite, the Fold Council Station for Xenobiotic Research and Engineering. The central question of the novel is whether or not Prokaryon will be terraformed, as Valedon has previously been. Terraforming and mining for rare-earth elements with lanthanide extractors is illegal in the Fold, unless scientists have established the existence on a planet of no intelligent life forms that can lay prior claim.

On the satellite, ’jum is cared for by Reverend Mother Artemis, an electronic being who has won her freedom as a “sentient”–– she has a screen for a face, nanoplastic hands, multiple breasts, and skirts which display holographic bears, lions, and flying fish from the Elysian ocean.  On the station, Mother Artemis discovers that ’jum is a prodigy at mathematics and geometry.

The group move to their Spirit Caller colony on Prokaryon, a world with triple-stranded DNA and a thin ozone layer, and colonists share rumors of “hidden masters”, unknown beings which direct the vegetation and animals to behave in odd ways. Indigenous life on the planet consists of zoöids, wheelgrass, helicoids (which fly in flocks), hoopsnakes, ring fungus, singing trees, tumblerounds (tire-shaped tumbleweeds), etc. The colony, which raises orphans, supports itself partly through mining for corundum and gem-quality stones in a nearby gravel pit.

Sarai, who is a Sharer from Valedon, is conducting research on Prokaryon. She heals children of the colony, and requests help –– in specific, the child ’jum, who she has taken a liking to, and whose analytical skills she finds useful. Together Sarai and ’jum study microzoöids. Their work is threatened by Proteus Unlimited, a company which the Fold has entrusted to manage Sarai’s research facility. Sarai threatens Proteus Unlimited’s “male-freakish” representatives.

In the second half of the novel, Sarai and ’jum learn to interpret the light-emissions of the microzoöids, and they prove themselves to be an intelligent life form on Prokaryon. At the same time, however, preparations are being made to terraform Prokaryon. While debate in preparation for the terraforming takes place, the microzöids reveal themselves to be the hidden masters of Prokaryon, and they also reveal they have decided to destroy humanity, because “Intelligent worlds are too dangerous. Not worth the risk.” However, say the microzoöids, “The few left will be bred as animals.” In the end, a fragile truce is established between humans and micozoöids, who have generated so quickly, the younger generations have lost their taste for universal domination."

The Goblin Reservation
 is the tale of Professor Peter Maxwell. It is set in the distant future when the Earth has been transformed into a university planet; a planet where creatures from all over the galaxy come to study, teach, and be entertained by the amazing discoveries that Earth is now rich with. Among the many things that Earth can now boast is Time University: a university devoted to slipping through time and discovering the truth about past events. People and creatures from the past are brought forward in time to be interviewed, studied and to provide entertainment for the people of the future. Among these are Alley Oop, a very smart, if at times crude, 
Neanderthal
 rescued from certain death and educated in the future. The creatures that people of the past always thought to be myth—such as trolls, fairies, goblins, and the like—have been discovered and placed on various reservations where they live and are studied by those working at Supernatural, a division of the planet-wide university.

The story begins when Peter Maxwell comes home to Earth only to discover that he has died. He is forced to investigate his own ""murder"" and discover who or what wanted him dead. He also returns with an additional mystery. He was apparently copied by unknown aliens and sent to a hidden crystal world that may have come from the universe that existed before ours.

The knowledge contained in the crystal planet could belong to Earth if Maxwell can discover what the intelligences remaining on the planet want. The alien race known as Wheelers want the Artifact, a monolith on display in a museum on Earth. The connection between the two provides the climax to the story. Before the events of the story, the University is expecting to close a lucrative deal for the Artifact, as well as mounting a prestigious series of talks by William Shakespeare in person.

Shortly after rescuing thousands of prisoners of war from the Cetagandans, as detailed in the novella ""
Borders of Infinity
"", Admiral Miles Naismith and his Dendarii mercenaries arrive on Earth, fleeing Cetagandan retribution and needing to repair the resultant damage to their ships.

Miles visits the Barrayaran Embassy in London to obtain desperately needed payment for their last mission. He reports to Captain Duv Galeni, his Imperial Security superior and a Komarran whose aunt was one of the victims of an infamous massacre of civilians allegedly committed by Miles' father. As the funds will have to come from the nearest sector headquarters in another star system, Miles resumes his real identity as Lieutenant Vorkosigan and is assigned to the embassy as third assistant military attaché, under Galeni's command. He finds his cousin Ivan Vorpatril is the second assistant attaché. Galeni later mysteriously disappears.

During his wait, Miles has to frantically fend off financial disaster due to the Dendarii not being paid promptly. Then he is abducted, and his place taken by a clone created and trained as an assassin by Komarran diehards determined to free their planet. The Komarrans are led by Ser Galen, Galeni's own father, who had been presumed killed while fighting against the Barrayaran occupiers. Miles is locked up with Galeni, who has been interrogated using drugs, but has resisted attempts by his father to get him to join the Komarran resistance. Miles himself is given a dose of fast-penta, a 
truth drug
, but his reaction to it is idiosyncratic.  Instead of docilely answering all questions, he becomes manic; he finds that he can beat the drug by flying off on wild tangents, such as reciting military manuals, poems and plays from memory.  Meeting his clone, Miles tells him that he could claim his rights as Miles' brother under Betan law.  Just before Miles and Galeni are to be executed, they are inadvertently rescued by his Dendarii subordinate (and lover) Elli Quinn.

Galen captures Vorpatril and uses him to force a tense meeting in the bowels of the 
Thames Barrier
 with Miles, who unexpectedly brings along Galeni. Galen disarms them, then orders the clone to kill Miles. However, the talks Miles has had with his clone bear fruit. The clone shoots and kills Galen instead, then flees. Complicating matters are Cetagandan and Barrayaran assassination squads (targeting Naismith and the clone, respectively), a Dendarii contingent and the local police, all converging on their location. Miles, with his usual tactical wizardry, is able to get himself, his clone, Vorpatril and Galeni safely away. As an added bonus, Miles arranges for the Cetagandans to see him and his clone together, ""proving"" that Naismith and Vorkosigan are not the same person. (It is revealed that Galen intercepted all messages to sector headquarters, explaining both the lack of payment and Miles' assignment on Earth.)

Miles is well aware his Betan mother would be greatly displeased if he did not help what she would consider his sibling. According to Barrayaran tradition, his brother would be named 
Mark Pierre Vorkosigan
. Miles gives the psychologically scarred ""Mark"" a considerable sum of money and an invitation to claim his Barrayaran heritage, if he wants to—or dares—then lets him go.

As Miles prepares to depart Earth, his Dendarii mentor, Ky Tung, announces his retirement to get married and live in Brazil."

The story begins in 1942, with a man named Saul Laski who fears for his life while at the 
Chełmno extermination camp
 built by Germans during World War II in 
Poland
. He is determined to resist being taken away in the night but something supernatural compels him to obey the orders of the 
Schutzstaffel
.

It continues in 1980 with a meeting of Melanie, Nina, and Willi in 
Charleston, South Carolina
. They discuss a game that involves using an innate power they have, which they call an Ability, to take remote control of people simply through thought and cause them to do anything. When these people are controlled to murder, it imparts those with the Ability to look and feel younger and more alive. As each member of the group presents their recent exploits, such as the 
murder of John Lennon
, a tension and unease between them is revealed as a kind of truce. When Willi's plane explodes the next day, Melanie suspects Nina and then a fight ensues, with both characters using innocent bystanders as soldiers and victims in a bizarre series of brutal murders involving children, old men, and security guards until Nina is shot in the head and dies.



An investigation
[
edit
]


There is a police and FBI investigation into a bizarre series of seemingly unconnected murders that span down a street on a single night as Sheriff Gentry and FBI Agent Haines interview a visiting psychologist named Saul Laski. Saul is famous for his theories about seemingly strange and impossible violence, but is as stumped as the sheriff. Later, Saul is compelled to break into the house where the murders started to investigate, and meets Natalie; who has come for the same reason; to find out why her father, a photographer used and murdered in the battle, has died so bizarrely. After realizing they are both looking for answers, Saul reveals to Natalie that he has a past with supernatural violence, having been used by someone with the Ability in 
Chełmno
 long ago, ever since looking to find the 
SS
 Officer, an 
Oberst
, who controlled him in a perverse series of ways, including as a living pawn in a life-size game of chess with a Nazi General where each piece removed from the board was executed. As the chess game ended, Saul continued to be used to hunt down the Nazi General, who apparently had a weaker Ability than the Oberst. Saul is controlled to kill the General. Regaining his willpower for a moment in an explosion, he flees into the forest and survives the rest of the 
holocaust
 amongst 
Partisan Polish
 and later 
Partisan Jewish
 forces before finding solace in 
Zionist
 Israel. This story is shared with sheriff Gentry later.



The Island Club
[
edit
]


Sheriff Gentry, now the only one investigating the murders as the 
FBI
 has shown no interest, realizes he is being followed. Eventually he confronts his follower, who instead of speaking immediately attacks Gentry and is killed in the ensuing struggle. There is no record of the person existing in US Government files, which leads Gentry to begin to believe Saul's incredible story. It is revealed that the reason the FBI was quick to stop investigating is that it is in part controlled by elements of the 'Island Club,' a 
Cabal
 of influential people with The Ability in the United States, such as Charles Colben of the FBI and Special Agent Haines, as well as 
billionaire
 C. Arnold Barent, Senatorial aide Nieman Trask, an influential 
Televangelist
, and others. They discuss that 
Ayatollah Khomeini
 has a weak ability and thought he was the only one, and thus saw himself as godlike. They also discuss that they are manipulating the 
1980 United States presidential election
 by way of the 
Iran Hostage Crisis
 to ensure 
Ronald Reagan
's election. Willi kills a member of the club through long-distance use of a controlled surrogate to get their attention, asking to be a part of the games.

Meanwhile, Melanie flees, accessing hidden identities and bank accounts throughout the US, and prepares to hide using identities and money she has waiting in France. At the 
Atlanta Airport
, she is terrified by a courtesy phone call when she hears Nina's voice, convincing her that somehow Nina has cheated death, perhaps with a stronger Ability than previously known. Melanie uses people in a blind panic and ends up in 
Germantown, Philadelphia
. She meets and conditions a new pawn, a hitchhiking thug called Vincent, into a mute killer. Saul, after years of working with various groups to track down the Oberst, believes he has found him—a man named Willi Borden. Saul hires 
Private detectives
 to track Willi, but they either disappear in 
Los Angeles
 or die. Saul reaches out to family members working in the 
Mossad
 for help in the same search for Willi Borden. This leads to his nephew Aaron, as well as Aaron's wife and children, being killed by agents of the Island Club.



Events in Philadelphia
[
edit
]


Melanie begins setting up a new series of controlled helpers and a new life in 
Philadelphia
. Verbally harassed by gang members, she begins sending Vincent to brutally butcher and 
impale
 the heads of gang members as a warning, which sparks further violence in the community but also draws the attention of both Saul's group and the Island Club. Tony Harod, a vile 
Hollywood
 producer who only uses his Ability to subjugate and rape women, has been offered a membership in the Island Club if he agrees to help hunt down Willi and Melanie. He arrives in Philadelphia as all other characters arrive for a variety of reasons, the Island Club using the CIA and FBI to cordon off Germantown, Philadelphia from any outside intervention, including 
police
 and 
firefighters
. As Natalie and Gentry investigate, the Island Club uses a bus full of people to attack them—and they flee to the safety of the gang since no authorities arrive to help. A huge firefight erupts as Natalie and Gentry marshall the gang forces against the ""
voodoo
 woman"" who killed their comrades against those she controls, while the FBI adds to the violence in an attempt to flush out either Willi or Melanie, as well as kill Gentry and Natalie for knowing too much. Gentry and Natalie get to the house and almost to Melanie, but Vincent attacks, killing Gentry, as Natalie kills Vincent. Melanie has been driven more 
insane
 by the thought of Nina being alive, and sees the violence erupting around her through her lens of 
racism
 as a bad northern neighborhood gone worse. Melanie escapes, controlling one old woman in a car. She is followed by Charles Colben of the Island Club in a 
helicopter
 with a rifle. The controlled old woman is shot. Melanie manages to destroy the helicopter and Colben through use of the old woman who appears dead but can be pushed beyond human limits by her Ability, and escapes to a park where she meets and takes over a family.

Saul and Natalie escape wounded but alive, heal, and get help from the 
Mossad
 revealing some but not all information about the Island Club. They manage to get supplies for a complicated trap for Tony Harod. They kidnap him in Los Angeles and take him to a secret 
interrogation
 room operated by the Mossad in an abandoned barn east of 
San Juan Capistrano, California
 off the 
Ortega Highway
. There Tony Harod is interrogated under drugs to find out as much as possible about the Island Club and the Ability in general—getting info from 
EEG
 readouts as Tony tries in vain to control Natalie to escape. The 
EEG
 reveals information about a 
theta rhythm
 signature that occurs when people with the Ability attempt to control others. Harod believes this interrogation about the Island Club is the work of Willi, using Saul and Natalie, and he is released, being told to follow Willi's instructions, upon penalty of death, through his supposed pawns (Saul and Natalie). Saul realizes as they are packing up that he is being pursued by FBI Agent Haines, and sets the barn on fire and flees with Natalie. They eventually kill Haines just outside 
Lake Elsinore, CA
 and escape, lost in a stolen car along fire service roads until ending up in 
Fallbrook, California
.



Island Club Games
[
edit
]


The Island Club ""games"" begin on a private island of C. Arnold Barent. Willi has apparently been working with the televangelist to vote to take the Island Club ""games"" global. This means they will not simply control a few people on the private island to see who is the most powerful, but control leaders of nations with nuclear results.  Willi has shown his power earlier by using one of two people stationed in the control room at an 
Air Force
 
missile silo
 in 
Meriden, Wyoming
 to demonstrate his ability to instigate United States-
USSR
 
nuclear war
. Saul and Natalie plan to infiltrate the island. Saul will pose as one of the runaways used as human pawns in the island games, being brought there by Tony Harod as instructed after his interrogation. Natalie, back in Charleston, has found Melanie and convinced Melanie that Natalie is an agent of Nina warning her of Willi's power (his death on the plane was faked) and the Island Club's growing power.

The story's action climaxes at the private island. Saul becomes a willing pawn in the ""game,"" having trained himself with self-hypnosis for months to memorize as many details as possible of the lives of death camp victims and survivors of the 
holocaust
 so that when Willi attempts to control him, the memories of others will confuse Willi in a way that will gain Saul a few seconds to attack and kill the old man. Willi takes over the ""use and hunt"" aspect of the ""game"" and suggests taking the game global—which he and the televangelist support, and Barent and Kepler don't. Harod, being technically a full voting member of the club, abstains; caring less about old ambitions and more about surviving. The night quickly becomes a contest between those with superior Ability: Willi and Barent. They agree to play a living chess game for the fate of the ""games"" to come. If Willi wins, the game becomes global in lethality. If Barent wins, its barbarism is contained to the island. Saul gets his chance and kills Willi, who won the chess game. As Barent leaves, he is killed by Melanie's use of surrogates, coerced by Natalie back in Charleston. The book ends with Natalie going that same night on a suicide mission to finally kill Melanie and her collection of family, nurse, and doctor pawns. She barely succeeds, but it is revealed she only killed someone Melanie made to look like a body double through surgery and obfuscation. The book ends with Melanie comfortable and unchallenged in her abilities in France, keeping tabs on control of officers of a 
nuclear submarine

While leading the Dendarii Mercenaries on a hostage rescue mission, 
Miles Vorkosigan
 has a seizure — a recurring consequence of his death and resuscitation in 
Mirror Dance
 — which results in his accidentally (and non-fatally) severing the rescued hostage's legs with his weapon. Terrified of the consequences, Miles falsifies his mission report to his boss, Simon Illyan, the head of Imperial Security (ImpSec). Illyan finds out anyway, and Miles is forced to accept a medical discharge.

Miles becomes seriously depressed. His cousin Ivan Vorpatril, with the help of his friend and ImpSec Captain Duv Galeni (who encountered Miles during the events of 
Brothers in Arms
), manage to get him to break out of his funk.

Duv Galeni is enamored of Laisa Toscane, a very wealthy heiress and member of a Komarran economic delegation. Miles gets them invitations to a party hosted by Emperor Gregor, hoping to help him to score points with Laisa, but unexpectedly she and Gregor fall in love.  When their engagement is announced, Galeni is furious with Miles, calling him on a monitored line to express his rage at Barrayarans in general and the 
Vor
 class in particular.

When Illyan suffers a sudden, crippling mental impairment, Miles attempts to investigate, but receives no cooperation from Lucas Haroche, ImpSec's acting chief, so he asks Gregor to assign him an Imperial Auditor, a troubleshooter answerable only to the Emperor. Gregor unexpectedly decides that it would save many steps (and his time) by making Miles himself a temporary Auditor, even if Haroche considers Miles a prime suspect in Illyan's impairment.

Illyan's breakdown was caused by a malfunction in the memory device implanted in his brain when he was a young lieutenant. The device begins dumping random sets of memories into Illyan's mind at an accelerating pace, causing him to believe he is at different points in his life. After consulting with Gregor, Miles orders ImpSec's doctors to remove the device as soon as possible. Then he sets out to find out whether the breakdown was natural or artificial. He recruits ""Dr. Waddell"", formerly Hugh Canaba, a biotechnology expert he extracted from Jackson's Whole (in ""
Labyrinth
"").  Waddell discovers the culprit is a synthetic biological agent specially designed to target Illyan's implant.

Illyan moves into Vorkosigan House to recover, where he receives visits from Lady Alys Vorpatril, Gregor's social secretary, who was also at his bedside during his breakdown.

While making a thorough inspection of ImpSec headquarters, Miles finds the first clue: a false record that claims he entered ImpSec's storeroom recently. An inventory establishes that the weapon was commissioned by Ser Galen, Duv Galeni's now-deceased Komarran terrorist father. It was stolen by someone trying to frame Lieutenant Vorkosigan, not Lord Auditor Vorkosigan.

Thanks in part to his ill-advised call to Miles, Duv Galeni is arrested for the attack. However, Miles is certain that this is also a frameup. When Haroche offers to reinstate Miles and put him back in charge of the Dendarii Mercenaries, Miles realizes that he has been offered a (nearly irresistible) bribe and that Haroche committed the crime to become head of ImpSec. He maneuvers Haroche into incriminating himself. Gregor consults with the other Auditors and makes Miles' appointment permanent.

Miles makes one final attempt to persuade his second-in-command and lover, Elli Quinn, to marry him, but she cannot bear being planet-bound, so he gives her command of the Dendarii. Gregor and Laisa become betrothed. Illyan and Alys, meanwhile, have become secret lovers, to Ivan's dismay. Duv Galeni becomes engaged to Delia Koudelka.

Miles undergoes surgery to implant a device that can pre-emptively trigger a milder seizure at a time of his choosing as a palliative measure, the underlying condition being incurable."

A small number of students, who are angry at the breaking of their contract with the University of Mars, Sinai, start a protest and plan to storm the university. Although the attempted coup ends in a stalemate, a protester, Casseia Majumdar, establishes her position. The story picks up again a few years later when Casseia is more mature. She does not necessarily regret her actions in the attempted revolution, but continues to be haunted by their consequences, especially her love affair with fellow student Charles Franklin.

Casseia eventually emerges as a fledgling politician in her BM, and wins a trip to Earth with her BM's representative and the BM's Thinker to discuss the situation between Earth and Mars, which is getting increasingly worse. Meanwhile, Charles, her one-time lover, along with a team of super-geniuses called the Olympians, discovers a radical new technology that has the potential to turn the tables on the conflict. He theorizes that the universe is basically a large computer and discovers a way to ""tweak"" the laws of the universe to create an effect. The Earth does not know exactly what this new technology can do, but they have hints of it and fear it. Casseia returns to Mars and marries into a family with potentially political ambitions due to their perceived neutrality. Her mother-in-law eventually becomes president of an interim central Martian government, and chooses Casseia as her vice-president. Tensions between the BMs and Earth grow to crisis levels, as news of the Olympians' discovery frightens the Earth government into pressuring the Martians to cooperate. One method of coercion that the Martians fear is ""evolvons"", or small undetectable computer viruses implanted during manufacture into all Thinkers. Martians fear that the Earth will use these to control all Martian Thinkers, and therefore cripple essential operations.

While the tension between Earth and Mars builds, the Olympians, led by Charles Franklin, reveal to Casseia that they have the ability to instantly move anything an infinite distance or to redefine the properties of an object by ""tweaking"" the properties of an object, with the help of a QL Thinker. The ramifications of this become clear to Casseia and the leaders of the interim government immediately, but they so fear its power that they refuse to use it as anything but a last resort. Charles is convinced that ""tweaking"", as the technique is called, is the solution, and orders a QL Thinker to speed up the process.  Eventually, he is able to test his technique by converting part of a substance into an 'anti-matter' of its properties.

The test shows everyone on Earth what the potential of this breakthrough really is, and Earth fears the power it gives the Martians. They double their efforts to 
duplicate the technology
 and eventually activate the evolvons, creating chaos on Mars but also uniting it against the Earth. Earth then demands that Mars government allow them to take over and place themselves into a junior relationship status. Martians retaliate by moving the moon Phobos into Earth orbit to demonstrate their ability to respond, but this only escalates the conflict.  Earth withdraws their demands but now are racing to duplicate the technology they now know is possible. Charles is able to test the moving object technique by linking his mind to a QL Thinker and using Phobos as a base, visits a planetary system to investigate as a new potential home for moving Mars to. Casseia travels along with his team as the government representative. The test goes well, but with Charles' mind linked to the QL Thinker, it nearly ends in disaster when the QL Thinker becomes distracted trying to test other ""truths"". While connected to the Thinker, the raw intelligence of the Thinker imposes its intellectual will on Charles, and tempts him to test every use of this technique, these ""truths"", even those that would be destructive.

Shortly after the planetary system visit, Earth invades Mars with nanotech robots that kill the Martian President, leaving Casseia as the one in charge.  Under attack and with no hope of fighting back, she makes the decision to go along with Charles Franklin's desperate plan to completely remove Mars from the 
Solar System
 and place it in orbit around a star 10,000 light-years away. To do it, Charles Franklin must connect his mind to the QL Thinker again. The same temptation as in the first test nearly overcomes Charles' willpower; he prevails, but it costs him his mind. The novel ends with an aged Casseia looking at the new Martian sky and hoping that the decision she made was the right one."

On the grossly-overpopulated planet, remnants of ""nature"" exist only in the isolated areas not covered by housing, industry and industrial farming. Creativity and individuality are suppressed and channeled into rigid social formats. A powerful 
bureaucracy

police state
 oversees the acts of all citizens. Its purpose is to maintain control for the planetary elite, and to that end it is prepared to resort to any method, however ruthless.

In contrast to all this, the author introduces another planet on which human development has followed a diametrically opposite path: the natural world is respected; population is limited; and each individual is encouraged to develop uniquely. On this other world, human beings are known to be basically ""spiritual"", and immortal in nature.

The story takes place in 2048, 51 years after scientists at 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
 develop a 
force field
-generating device they term the Bobbler. The Bobbler creates a perfectly spherical, reflective, impenetrable, and persistent shield around or through anything.

The bureaucracy running the Laboratory decide to use the Bobbler as a weapon. Declaring themselves the ""Peace Authority"", they enclose the world's weapons and military bases in bobbles, and occasionally entire cities or governments. A brief war is triggered but ends quickly as the military is cut off from command, their weapons, and each other. It is presumed that the people within the bobbles die due to a lack of air and sunlight, since it is believed that the universe is partitioned by a bobble into two sections (inside and outside the bobble). In this new world, governments are weak where they are permitted at all; the Peace Authority seizes control and becomes a 
worldwide government
. In an effort to retain their monopoly on the Bobbler, the Peace Authority makes technological progress illegal and returns the planet to a level similar to that of the 19th century.

The story opens with the crew of a military spaceplane emerging from their bobble and being picked up by a group of Tinkers. The Tinkers are a rebel group who have continued to secretly develop technology to a point well beyond what the Authority allows. Their emergence reveals two previously unknown facts about bobbles: one is that they are not force fields, but rather 
stasis fields
 inside which no time elapses, and the second is that they do not last forever, but will eventually ""pop"" at a time that is not initially determinable by the operators of the Bobbler. The bobble around the spaceplane is the first one known to pop; it is eventually found that the first bobbles last roughly fifty years.

One of the original inventors of the bobble helped form the Tinkers. He develops a more advanced version of the bobbler which can produce bobbles of any size, unlike the Authority's original which is at least house-sized and requires a huge amount of power to run. They also find that they can set the duration of a bobble. Using their new device, they learn that one cannot form a bobble around another. This provides a defence; one can carry a small bobble (in a pocket, for instance), making it impossible for the Peace Authority to bobble that person. With the help of a young thief and mathematical genius, they lead a rebellion to try to bobble the power generators of the Peace Authority and thus neutralize its primary weapon."

The story begins in the year 2010, which was 25 years in the future from the time of the novel's writing. A 
UN
 financed research lab is pursuing a strange goal: manipulate 
metabolism
 and 
brain
 function in order to eliminate the need for 
sleep
. They are currently working on 
Kodiak bears
 and 
domestic cats
, but hope to adapt their techniques to humans. The world situation is very dire. 
Global warming
 is in full swing. Crop failures and production shortfalls are dragging down the standard of living, with no sign of relenting. Political tensions are very high.

Meanwhile, an eccentric billionaire industrialist has privately financed the construction of many massive orbital 
arcologies
. Via 
asteroid mining
 these 
space stations
 have become the world's single richest entity. The UN cuts funding for the zero-sleep lab and the industrialist hires their entire staff to work in his primary station.

In the middle of the scientist's 
rocket
 approach to the station, catastrophe strikes. 
China
, whose population is suffering massive famine, launched a desperate 
nuclear attack
 against the West. The 
mutually assured destruction
 policy plays out and the new station residents watch as the world is destroyed below them. The industrialist is so distraught by the end of 
Earth
 
civilization
 he suffers a fatal 
heart attack
. His dying words to the chief scientist instruct her that his real motive for hiring them was to research 
suspended animation
 technology. His dream is to fit the arcologies with interstellar drives and create human colonies on 
extrasolar planets
.

The novel then begins Part II nearly 30,000 years later. On a planet called Pentecost in the 
Eta Cassiopeiae
 system, a large human civilization of indeterminate technological level now exists. A standout feature of their culture is ""Planetfest"" a series of grueling 
endurance challenges
. The top 25 finalists are given large prizes like high government positions or land holdings. This civilization is only aware of their Earth origins in a 
legendary
 sense. They have limited 
space travel
 capacity, and citizens who go to work in space come back with rumors about beings called 
Immortals
, who apparently live forever and can travel 
light years
 in days, and have some kind of shadowy influence on their planetary 
government
.

The story follows a Planetfest contestant, Peron, who has just found he finished in 3rd place. This year the winners are all taken to space, where further competition will send the top 10 to meet and work with the mysterious Immortals. Peron makes fast friends with the other top finalists and during their next cycle of challenges begin to uncover suspicious elements of the Immortals, Planetfest, and their entire society. During one of the off-planet trials, Peron is critically injured and another contestant (a ringer for the Immortals) makes a snap decision to bring him to the Immortals prematurely in order to save his life.

Peron awakens on a space ship in a strange dream-like state, and is introduced to the ship's Immortal crew, some of whom are scientists from the first part of the book. They consider Peron a nuisance for circumventing the normal process of being indoctrinated into Immortal society from a distance before meeting them. He is given very little information, but witnesses the Immortals 
teleport
 throughout the ship and make objects appear in their hands at will. His compatriates are all being held in suspended animation. Peron breaks away from the Immortal's monitoring and discovers the secret to their power. He gains control of the ship, awakens his friends, and holds the ship 
hostage
 until the Immortals explain what's going on.

The last 30 millennia of human history is then summarized quickly. After the 
nuclear holocaust
 the self-sufficient space arcologies (with a total population less than 1 million) began to fragment and some went off looking for new planets, as their industrialist founder had intended. The majority stayed in earth 
orbit
, continuing to use the resources available in our home system. The travellers developed very slowly, because they had to spend all their energy on survival in deep space. Those left behind continued scientific research and tried to re-colonize Earth, but the severe 
nuclear winter
 led into 10,000 year 
ice age
.

Their crowning scientific achievement was called Mode II Consciousness or S-Space. This was an accidental byproduct of their zero-sleep project, which revealed a way to slow human metabolism and consciousness such that they would remain fully aware, but perceive time at 1/2000th the normal rate. This explains how they live ""forever"" and can travel between stars in ""days"", because they are calculated from the subjective perspective of someone living in S-Space. The Immortals' ability to make objects appear in their hands instantly, is just a result of service 
robots
 placing the object in their hand at normal speed, which is too fast to notice from the perspective of S-Space.

After this discovery, the leading arcology decides to track down the traveling arcologies. Their trip takes place in S-Space so they never age, gaining their Immortal moniker. Meanwhile, the normal space (N-space) travellers have endured hundreds of generations and repeated political upheavals. The Immortals discover that due to their twisted metabolisms they cannot breed. Using their vastly superior technology, they control the new planet-based colonies from behind the scenes and use the Planetfest games as a recruiting method to reinforce their numbers. Peron and company commandeer the ship and go back to their legendary roots of Earth, while in S-Space.

En route they realize that centuries have passed on their homeworld and there is no point in ever returning. The ship also encounters shadowy deep-space life forms of ambiguous intelligence, who are only visible from S-space. The Immortal crew dismisses this routine sighting as just another mystery of the galaxy. Peron arrives on Earth, finding it as nothing more than a mostly frozen nature preserve. They discuss their next move and resolve to uncover more secrets about the Immortals. While in orbit around Earth they detect that a large portion of the radio traffic throughout the Immortals' 
communication network
 seems to be coming from nowhere.

When they track down the location they find the hidden Immortal 
headquarters
 isolated in deep space. Peron's gang manages to evade security and stowaway aboard a supply ship bound for the headquarters. Upon arrival they are immediately captured by the superior security at HQ. Here they meet the other scientist characters from Part I and are congratulated for coming so far. They are invited to become equal partners in the quest to solve a new problem.

Apparently the 
deep space
 life forms they briefly saw previously, are miniature versions of giant entities situated in the gulfs of 
deep space between galaxies
. These enormous beings are unquestionably intelligent, and the Immortal HQ is actually a research station entirely devoted to studying them. These beings communicate on extremely long wavelengths, which are so slow, even S-Space is woefully inadequate to process them. However Immortals have interpreted some signals, which seem to indicate the Deep Space Beings predict that the stars in the 
spiral arm
 will all mysteriously go dark in the next 40,000 years; an impossibly short time on the 
cosmological scale
. Whether the Deep Space beings are actively causing this artificial transformation is unknown.

To better understand the problem, the Immortals are devising a new T-Space which is an even more radical slowing of human consciousness. Peron's group agree to help, but insist on building a new facility that will be operated only in N-space, resisting the logic that S-Space is superior method of operation. After much debate, the Immortal scientists agree to the plan. The narrative ends here, but the last few pages are from the perspective of one of Peron's friends who has volunteered as a guinea pig for T-Space. He relates the last 5 T-minutes of the universe, which is over 1000 years of normal time. He witnesses the final 
Big Crunch
 while somehow he and the deep space beings remain unaffected by the

The book consists of four distinct parts. The primary purpose of part one is the introduction of the characters, in ancient Britain and the present. Part two introduces a modern first-person view of the Order in Rome while following Regina's budding legacy centuries before. Part three hosts the clash and resolution of Poole and the Order's realities. Part four is a look eons into Humanity's Expansion into the Universe and provides a conclusion in George Poole's present.



Part one
[

George Poole
[
edit
]


George Poole copes with the mid-life crisis of losing his father. He meets Peter McLachlan, an eccentric member of an online free-thinking Internet group called the Slan(t)ers, who is researching dark matter and who is fascinated by a new and unknown artificial object discovered beyond the orbit of Pluto. George Poole uncovers an old picture showing a sister he never knew. Poole also discovers that his father regularly donated large sums of money to an organisation called the ""Puissant Order of Holy Mary Queen of Virgins"". Combined with a sense of futility in determining his future and encouragement from both Peter and his former wife Linda, Poole decides to uncover the mystery of his missing sister.

Poole leaves England to visit his sister Gina (who is 
not
 his newly discovered missing sister) in Florida for information, despite their strained relationship. After spoiling his clever nephews as well as clashing with his distant sister Gina, Poole extracts the contact of a 
Jesuit
 priest in Rome and his own retired uncle in Florida. Poole learns from his uncle, Lou Casella, that his twin sister was given to the ancient Order when Poole's parents were unexpectedly landed with twins.



Regina
[
edit
]


Born into a wealthy mosaic-designing family of 5th-century Roman Britain, seven-year-old Regina is uprooted from her comfortable villa due to her father's death and the 
Roman Empire
's withdrawal. The Roman Empire loses its strength in Britain as invading 
Saxons
 pummel the Great Wall north of Roman settlements to where Regina and her grandfather Aetius relocated. Aetius dies after losing control over his unpaid mutinous soldiers.

Regina seeks refuge with her servant Cartumandua's relatives in 
Verulamium
 but is betrayed by Carta's cousin Amator who rapes and abandons her. Verulamium burns down, forcing Regina and Cartumandua's family to live off the land in poverty for over sixteen years. Regina kills a roaming Saxon who nearly rapes her daughter, Brica. This event convinces Regina, the leader of their hamlet, to accept the invitation of warlord 
Artorius
 to help restore order to Britain again.



Part two
[

]


Lucia
[
edit
]


In modern Rome, Lucia, a fifteen-year-old scribe for the Order, is devastated when she begins to 
menstruate
 — unlike any of her friends and colleagues within the Order. Once this is discovered Lucia is initiated into in her new role within the Order. Meanwhile, Lucia falls in love with seventeen-year-old American Daniel Stannard but is snatched back into the Order to do what is expected of her. After being impregnated by an anonymous distant cousin in a ceremony held deep within the Order's chambers Lucia gives birth following only three months of pregnancy. The baby is removed from her at once and Lucia never sees her baby again. Emotionally unstable, she runs away with Daniel.



Regina
[
edit
]


Back in 5th Century Britain, Regina establishes her life working with Artorius, eventually managing his kingdom's record keeping. Artorius takes Regina as his wife for symbolic and moral reasons. She disdains Artorius' barbaric practices and thirst for conquest. Regina accompanies Artorius to a War Council where she realises to stay attached with the reckless Artorius would mean certain doom for her progeny. To search out her mother, Julia, Regina secures passage to Rome by allowing herself and her daughter to give sexual favours to a wealthy merchant named Ceawlin.

Upon arriving in Rome, Regina contacts Amator, now openly homosexual and a wealthy bakery owner, and demands recompense for abandoning her and her family. Regina re-establishes contact with her mother, Julia, after a cool reunion. Regina joins the Puissant Order of Holy Mary Queen of Virgins, a Christian-adapted faction of the 
Vestal Virgins
 located on the Appian Way – an organisation that her family has become intimate with. Regina's leadership revives the ageing Order by converting it into a successful private school. Years later, on the night following her daughter's marriage, the 
Sack of Rome
 in 455 by the 
Vandals
 occurs. Regina's foresight saves the Order when the women and children are evacuated into the catacombs she had dug for a sanctuary.

In Regina's twilight years, she establishes important rules precedents for the Order. Unnecessary and unsupportable births are prohibited. A handful of mothers must dedicate their lives to replenishing the Order with births. Before her death in 476 AD, Regina establishes three main rules to govern the Order:



Sisters matter more than daughters.


Ignorance is strength.


Listen to your sisters.


Part three
[
edit
]


In the centuries following Regina's death, the Order assists the poor, robbed, and injured, gaining donations to its coffers from the occasional assisted person who became wealthy.  Another Crypt that developed similarly to the Order is found and plans made for its eradication and occupation.  In 1527, the Order survives the 
pillage of Rome
 during the Papacy of 
Clement VII
 by sacrificing five of its members to rape and death to divert Clement and his men's attention from an entrance to the Crypt.



George Poole
[
edit
]


Meanwhile, in the present, George Poole, followed by a nervous Peter McLachlan, has a cool reunion with his lost sister Rosa. Rosa gives George a tour of the Crypt, the Order's secret human cache. Peter speculates with George about evidence of intelligent dark matter life moving through earth. Daniel serendipitously meets with George Poole, who is searching for additional information about the Order. Daniel, George Poole, and Peter take the very pregnant Lucia to a hospital where Peter becomes suspicious of the mysterious Order. The Order promptly retrieves Lucia from the hospital but not before Peter and George learn that most of the Crypt's inhabitants 
remain prepubescent indefinitely
.

George Poole convinces his Jesuit priest contact to grant Peter access to ancient Catholic records. George's patriarchal roots are traced to a British surveyor named George Poole who came to Rome in 1863. George returns to the Crypt looking for information and finds himself smothered with the 
familiar smell
 and contact of those in the Crypt, all of whom share his similar facial features (namely, cloudy grey eyes). His sister Rosa almost persuades him to become assimilated into the Order as a stud but an urgent text message by Peter brings him to his senses.

Peter has a theory explaining the strange peculiarities of the Order. The Order is a family of 
eusocial
 humans that evolved from the intense pressures to survive the various conquests of Rome over the centuries. He cites 
naked mole rats
 as an example of eusocial behaviour in mammals. He explains how Regina's three rules result in a ""genetic mandate for eusociality.""  He calls the Order a ""human hive"" and labels them ""Coalescents"" — a new kind of human. Peter then suddenly leaves after receiving a text message.

Days later, George learns that Peter has invaded the Crypt and is threatening to set off 
Semtex
 
plastic explosives
 to expose the Order. Peter and the Slan(t)ers are responsible for the recent bombing of a 
San Jose
 research facility investigating 
quantum gravity
 technology – under the belief that a higher intelligence would notice the manipulation of 
space-time
 and eradicate a possible threat to their superiority. Peter's reasoning in exposing the Crypt is that the Order does not exist for any purpose except for itself. It threatens to destroy humanity as individuals and replace it with mindless drones. Peter Mclachlan then detonates his bombs and dies. George begins the evacuation of the Crypt, and the mob of drones emerge hive-like from the crater in the middle of 
Via Cristoforo Colombo
.

Toward the end of the novel there are also two short sections telling of a hive planet in the far future. A planet has been knocked out of its solar orbit, and the hives have survived deep underground for aeons. A military mission arrives, aiming to secure workers for the war-effort, and invades a colony. They fight their way into the hive, and ship the survivors off-world."

The difference from actual history starts with the participation of 
Harriet Tubman
 in Brown's uprising in 1859; her sound tactical and strategic advice helps Brown avoid mistakes which in real history led to his downfall. As a result, instead of the 
American Civil War
, the U.S. faces a full-scale 
slave revolt
 throughout the 
South
 helped by a handful of white sympathizers and various European revolutionaries such as 
Giuseppe Garibaldi
, and an invasion by 
Mexico
, which seeks to regain the 
territory it lost in 1848
.

After a great deal of bloody fighting and an increasing dissatisfaction in the North which is required to send troops to fight the rebellious slaves, the blacks succeed in emancipating themselves and create a republic in the 
Deep South
, led by Tubman and 
Frederick Douglass
. (Brown himself did not survive to see the victory of what he started.) 
Abraham Lincoln
 – a Whig politician who never got to be President – tries to start a war to bring back the secessionist black states into the 
Union
, but he fails and is himself 
killed
 in that war. Blacks remember him as their archenemy.

Later, the black state (named ""
Nova Africa
"") becomes Socialist, touching off a whole string of revolutions and civil wars in Europe. The 
Paris Commune
 wins out in 1871 instead of being crushed by the 
French Third Republic
, 
Ireland
 breaks away from 
British
 rule in the 1880s, and the 
Russian Revolution
 is just one of many similar revolutions in different countries. Finally Socialism also wins out in the rump U.S., following a revolutionary outbreak in 
Chicago
. Socialism works out as predicted by the German philosopher 
Karl Marx
, bringing happiness and prosperity to all of humanity. (Marx himself is mentioned in the book as an enthusiastic supporter of the rebellious slaves, though he does not personally come to America to help them.)

The book has two levels. The overt plot takes place in 1959, in a 
Utopian Socialist
 world far in advance of ours in all ways. To mark the centennial of Brown's raid, black astronauts lead a mission to 
land on Mars
. However, the story of the protagonist, a young black woman grieving the death of her husband on an earlier 
Mars
 mission, is mainly the framework for excerpts from the vivid diaries of two people who lived through the stirring events of 1859 and its aftermath – her ancestor, who was then a young black slave, and a white Virginian doctor who sympathized with the rebellion. In this world, an alternate history book is published called 
John Brown's Body
, which describes a world in which Brown failed and was executed, the slaves were 
emancipated by Lincoln
 rather than by themselves after 
a war between two white factions
, and capitalism survived as a political and economic system. It is considered a 
dystopia
, describing a horrible world in all ways inferior to the one which the people in the book know."

Bass' future Earth is an environment in which the sum of the 
biota
 serves as its 
food chain
. Human science has created the four-toed Nebish, a pallid, short-lived and highly programmable 
humanoid
 who has had the elements that do not facilitate an underground Hive existence (aggression, curiosity, etc.) bred out of it. The five-toed humans (called buckeyes) wander the 
biofarms
 that keep the trillions of Earth's Nebish population fed. All vertebrates other than man and rat are 
extinct
, so meat comes from other humans (and the occasional rat). The conflict between the Hives and the roving bands of five-toed original Humans, who are reduced to savagery and hunted like 
vermin
 by Hive Security, forms the backdrop of this novel.

The story begins as Old Man Moon and his dog Dan wander the fields.  They are genetic experiments with their biological clocks stopped.  They encounter Toothpick, a companion cyber from the days when technology was more advanced before the hive decline.  Toothpick urges Moon to pick him up, but Moon does not like cybers—they work for the Hive.  Toothpick promises food and when he makes good on his promise that an electrical storm will short circuit the agromecks from reporting his pilfering of the gardens, Moon considers Toothpick's offer of companionship.  Toothpick explains he is a companion cyber, and when he promises new teeth for Moon and Dan, Moon agrees and the three set off on Toothpick's unstated mission.

Something strange is happening, as the primitive buckeyes are showing signs of a purpose whose goal is unclear and probably dangerous to the balance of the Hive. There seems to be a third party stirring the pot, campaigning in a relentlessly successful battle with the computer minds that keep this ""brave new world"" in balance. Agendas beyond the ken of their protagonists begin to come into play, and an epic battle between the Four- and the Five-toed is looming."

City of Sorcery
 begins five years after the end of 
Thendara House
.
[
1
]
 The Renunciates and a select group of Terran women who have agreed to abide by Renunciate laws have formed The Bridge Society, to facilitate understanding between the two groups.

Magda Lorne learns from her supervisor, Cholayna Ares, that a Terran operative, Alexis Anders, has survived a plane crash in the Hellers a week earlier. Five days later, she appeared at the spaceport with amnesia. Cholayna believes Anders' memory has been tampered with and wants Magda to use her laran abilities to help recover her memories. After a bit of telepathic probing, Anders abruptly appears to have recovered, though she remembers nothing of her past week's ordeal.

Later, in retelling the story to Camilla at the Guildhouse, Magda recalls her three previous experiences with mystical visions of the Dark Sisterhood, and crows, which seem to be their avatars. Camilla tells Magda that the Sisterhood is a secret society; that she and Jaelle were both invited to join, but refused. With Jaelle's assistance, Magda makes contact with 
the Forbidden Tower
, but they are unable to explain Anders' experiences.

Rafaella undertakes a travel commission from Alexis Anders, but leaves a note behind for Jaelle. Magda tells Cholayna that Alexis has taken the expedition under false pretenses. Cholayna, Magda, Vanessa, Jaelle, and Camilla set out to follow Alexis. The expedition takes them high into the Hellers, through treacherous terrain. Magda goes into the Overworld to ask the advice of the Forbidden Tower, but is confronted by an ancient crone who repeatedly warns her to turn back. Magda refuses.

The Terran women suffer frostbite and altitude sickness, but continue despite their troubles. After about a week, they continue on their way, crossing the Kadarin River, and arrive at the city of Nevarsin. An arrogant 
leronis
, who calls herself Acquilara, greets them with a great deal of self-importance and bluster. The women are suspicious of her and decide to leave the city. Cholayna's altitude sickness gets worse, as do the travel conditions.

High in the Hellers, they meet Kyntha, who explains that they have arrived at the holy house of the goddess, Avarra, and offers to care for their injuries. Cholayna takes more than a week to recover. The women who care for them recoil at Acquilara’s name, declaring her evil.

Marisela, a sister from the Thendara guildhouse, known to also be a member of the sisterhood, arrives, having followed their entire journey. She explains that she serves the sisterhood, but is not one of them.

The group continues on in their journey, now seeking in earnest the mysterious city of the sisterhood. As they arrive at a pass that gives them a view of the mountains known as the ""wall around the world"", Marisela is killed, apparently by Acquilara. The others fall unconscious and awake in a cave.

Alexis Anders arrives, apparently under the control of Acquilara. She speaks abusively to all of those who have been attempting her rescue. She leads Magda to Acquilara, who turns out to have a political agenda and wants to exploit Magda’s connections with the Forbidden Tower. Magda refuses to help.

Magda and the others attempt an escape, but are recaptured. Magda has a vision of Kyntha, who tells her not to hate her captures, that it gives Acquilara entry into their minds. Again, they attempt to escape and find themselves in an all out fight. Jaelle attacks Acquilara, and in the fight, both fall over a cliff and are killed. Alexis is wounded, and also dies.

Kyntha now asks each of them what they seek. Camilla and Magda choose to enter the city of the sisterhood, while the others return to Thendara.

The story begins shortly after the point where 
Metropolitan
 left off, with Aiah, the previous novel's protagonist, arriving in ""Free Caraqui"" to assist Constantine in his ambitions. In Caraqui, Constantine is confronted with intrigues among the other power players from the revolution, counter-coups, and war with the surrounding metropolises. He must also deal with the consequences of enlisting one of his more disturbing allies, Taikoen. Centuries previous, Taikoen was a powerful mage whose name passed into legend; he eventually transformed into a ""hanged man,"" an entity of pure plasm whose only remaining drive is to possess other human beings and use their bodies to experience sensual pleasures until his victims die extremely gruesome deaths as a side effect of the possession. Constantine had made a pact with Taikoen to provide him bodies to feed on in exchange for destroying certain of his enemies, but is now wracked with guilt for doing this and is conflicted between his need to use Taikoen to further his ambitions and his worry that he has unleashed a monster he cannot control.

Aiah eventually grows to become a minor power in her own right in Caraqui, serving as a government liaison to some Barkazi mercenary units Constantine has hired to defend Caraqui (among many others). Aiah befriends a military mage from one of those units who helps her eventually destroy Taikoen.

Despite the conflict still raging, Constantine works to pursue his ultimate plan for the New City - nothing less than the destruction of the Shield that imprisons humanity in the world and the confrontation of whatever powers placed it there. Seeing plasm as the key to humanity's liberation, he enlists the help of Rohder, one of Aiah's old colleagues from the Plasm Authority in Jaspeer (and a minor character in 
Metropolitan
). A centuries-old researcher-mage, Rohder had discovered new geometric properties that could boost the production of plasm in cities, with the unfortunate need to completely reorder their infrastructure at prohibitive cost. Fortunately, Caraqui is a metropolis built on pontoons in the shallows of one of the world's seas, so Constantine enables him to experiment by physically moving parts of the city in concordance with his theory, which proves valid.

Aiah also stumbles onto the knowledge that at periodic intervals, a small hole opens up in the Shield through which plasm-based constructs can be sent. At the same time, she has been having dreams in which she sees entities named the Sun and Moon outside the Shield; these celestial bodies are mostly legend in the world, but there is a belief that the tides seen in the world's seas are caused by the effects of their gravity, which is able to pass through the Shield. Aiah learns that her dreams have similarities with the teachings of a mysterious monastic order in Caraqui, the Dreaming Sisters. At the novel's conclusion, Aiah seems to join the Dreaming Sisters in their curious form of meditation as a way of discovering what her dreams mean in the context of freeing the world from the Shield."

Unlike 
The Book of the New Sun
, 
The Urth of the New Sun
 mostly takes place outside Urth. The book is a continuation of Severian's narration of the aftermath of his ascent to the throne and subsequent journey ""between the suns"" to be judged and win back the fountain of life that will rejuvenate the slowly dying sun and revive life on Urth. When the book begins, Severian has already rewritten his accounts of before and is beginning his new log aboard the spaceship that will take him to Yesod, an enigmatic planet, home to the godlike beings who have the power to revitalize Urth and its sun.

Aboard the ship, Severian meets Zak, a mysterious being, who begins small and soon develops human form and turns out to be the all-powerful 
Tzadkiel
 of 
Yesod
. Once in Yesod, Severian faces an immense task of facing all the deceased people he has encountered since his childhood, including Thecla and Master Malrubius. When he faces the tribunal to be judged by Tzadkiel, he is told that the trial was already successfully passed. Severian is made the New Sun.

After his return to Urth from Yesod, he finds the sun still dying, and that the New Sun is still very far, far away, but nevertheless moving relentlessly. He learns that many years have passed backwards. He also learns that he possesses healing power that he once attributed the Claw of the Conciliator and is taken as a prisoner into the Citadel, where he tells a story to his followers to comfort them. A prisoner in the next cell writes it down as 
The Book of the New Sun
, the holy text of the Church of the Conciliator. He encounters the first Autarch Ymar and an earlier version of Typhon, who attempts to kill him. He manages to escape via the Corridors of Time. There, with the aid of a version of Tzadkiel, he travels back to the future. In his palace he finds his wife Valeria sitting on the throne attended by his old rival Baldanders (who has grown enough to match the size of an undine). Shortly after Severian reveals himself, an 
apocalyptic flood
 washes away the citadel and much of the land of Urth, thus bringing destruction and rebirth.

Severian travels as far into past as he can and a primitive tribe accepts him as their divine king Apu-Punchau. After teaching and helping them for decades, he finally decides to leave, but is then killed by the tribe in their panic. He wakes inside a tomb and is once again accompanied by the Hierodules Ossipago, Barbatus and Famulimus, as well as the dead body of Apu-Punchau. It is revealed that Severian is an 
eidolon
, a ghost-like being become material, and that he actually died on Tzadkiel's ship.

Once more, Severian flees through the Corridors of Time. Urth, now called 
Ushas
, has recovered from the flood. A priest recognizes Severian as the Sleeper, one of their gods, and then leads him to where the other gods sleep as the novel ends."

Jay Hilton, one of the surviving children from Lalonde, is awoken when Tranquillity falls under attack by the Organisation and its hellhawk allies. With the habitat in imminent danger of destruction, the Kiint personnel immediately evacuate by triggering their 'Emergency Exodus Facility', personal wormholes that transport them to the real Kiint home star system. An infant Kiint, Haile, decides that she cannot let Jay be killed in the attack and activates the Emergency Exodus Facility on her, removing her from Tranquillity as well, to the displeasure of her parents, Nang and Lieria. Jay finds herself on a planet which appears to be just one in a necklace of hundreds orbiting a star in the same orbit. Haile's parents reluctantly confirm that this, the Kiint home system, is actually in another galaxy, and the supposed Kiint homeworld of Jobis was actually just a single scientific outpost. They regretfully announce that Tranquillity has either been destroyed or forced to surrender to the possessed.

The Jovian Consensus is placed on an emergency alert when a colossal wormhole opens above 
Jupiter
. They are shocked when the habitat Tranquillity appears. Ione Saldana reveals that Michael Saldana feared that whatever destroyed the Laymil might return to its system, and gave Tranquillity the means to escape that threat.

The 
Lady Macbeth
 journeys to Trafalgar and there reveal the events of their mission to the First Admiral, who is happy that the Alchemist has been destroyed and Alkad Mzu is no longer at large. Because Joshua Calvert knows the mechanics of the Alchemist he must not risk death due to the event his soul is brought back in a different body and is tortured/interrogated by the possessed about his knowledge of the Alchemist. After thoroughly debriefing the crew, the First Admiral allows them to travel on to Tranquillity. A meeting is held and Ione proposes that Tranquillity and the Jovian Consensus join forces to track down the Tyrathca Sleeping God and see what use it could be in the fight with the possessed. Syrinx and the voidhawk 
Oenone
 volunteer for the mission and Joshua Calvert agrees to take the 
Lady Macbeth
 on the mission. The Confederation Navy and the Kulu ESA also agree to support the venture. Because the mission will involve travelling several thousand light-years far outside Confederation territory, 
Lady Macbeth
 is authorised to use antimatter on this mission. The Confederation Navy has located the antimatter production facility that is fuelling Capone's Organisation. They allow 
Lady Macbeth
 to fuel up and then destroy it. The Organisation hellhawk 
Stryla
 observes the attack and notes that the 
Lady Macbeth
 jumped to the Tyrathca prime colony world in Confederation space, and delivers that information to the Organisation. Several Organisation ships are despatched to pursue and investigate.

On Ombey, the Liberation Campaign begins with a massive assault on Mortonridge by tens of thousands of regular troops and Edenist bitek soldiers. Although the campaign is costly, ground is won and thousands of the possessed are forcibly ejected from their hosts. Eventually the possessed fall back on a small patch of land at the tip of the peninsula and by combining their energistic powers are able to teleport the entire patch of land into a strange grey realm. The possessed and the attacking soldiers agree to a truce until they can work out how to survive in this strange place.

The Valisk habitat is trapped in yet another realm, nicknamed ""the dark continuum"". Energistic power is weak in this place, and entropic decay is far more powerful than normal. As a result, Valisk's energy is being lost into the 'dark continuum', as it has been named. Even worse, what energy it does manage to generate attracts the attention of monstrous, immortal, shape-shifting predators known as Orgathé, who attack the habitat with enthusiasm to feed on its power. There is a gravitational incline in this dimension which leads to a horrifying place called the Mélange, a 
liquid nitrogen
–cold sea of beings trapped in this continuum, unable to accumulate enough energy to escape. Dariat escapes from Valisk in an escape pod with Tolton before it hits the Mélange and explodes, but they ponder that it is only a matter of time until the pod runs out of fuel and dissolves, forcing them to join the tortured beings outside.

The Confederation Navy research team discovers a possible way of killing the possessed, an 'anti-memory' device that will eradicate both the possessed and the possessing soul. The First Admiral is horrified about the weapon and even more horrified when President Haakar, panicking as the possession crisis spreads to more worlds, authorises its development. The scientists hope to create a more powerful version that will obliterate all of the tens of billions of souls in the beyond, which becomes a controversial idea among the Confederation government. Although the first weapon is completed, further research is suspended when a lone Organisation suicide attacker detonates an antimatter bomb right outside the habitat, irradiating it and destroying dozens of ships outside. The internal staff survive, but have to transfer their personnel and equipment to Avon. Furious, the First Admiral orders that the Organisation be permanently eradicated.

A fleet of over a thousand Confederation warships mobilises and attacks the worlds the Organisation have conquered, forcing them to withdraw back to New California. The other worlds, freed from the need to supply the Organisation with materials, are shifted out of the universe by their possessed populations.

Joshua Calvert and Syrinx begin their search for the Sleeping God by visiting the only known Tyrathca planet in the Confederation, breaking into the abandoned arkship in orbit around the planet, to determine the origin of the Tyrathca, whose original home planet appears to be on the far side of the Orion Nebula. On the way, however, the Tyrathca break into the arkship as well and pursue the expeditionary team, who also find evidence in the arkship's systems of prior use by the Kiint. The humans manage to escape by duplicating the manoeuvre of the blackhawk 
Udat
, swallowing into a hollow chamber in the arkship and swallowing out again to extricate the expeditionary team.

On Earth, Louise Kavanagh returns to London after warning Banneth of Quinn Dexter's intention of killing her. It is eventually revealed that Quinn's actions had been discovered by a secret Govcentral security council named B7. They are in contact with Banneth and attempt to use her as bait, to lure Dexter out of hiding and then hit the building he is in with an orbital gamma laser. Quinn sees through their trap though, and arranges for a double of himself to be in the building while it is destroyed, thereby killing Banneth and the double, and making B7 think he is dead. His plan is foiled, though, by a person calling himself ""a friend of Carter McBride"" (the boy Laton killed to expose Quinn's cult on Lalonde), and B7 is once again on Quinn's tracks. Louise is summoned by a member of B7, the Western Europe Supervisor. He reveals to her the truth about B7: it is a consortium of incredibly wealthy individuals whose ""financial institutions own a healthy percentage of the human race"". They believe themselves to be immortal, as they use affinity to transfer their memories and personality into clone bodies to avoid death, in much the same way as Edenists (although the Kiint reveal that souls are different from ""memory constructs"", and that therefore they actually died every time their old bodies were destroyed, with their souls moving on). He also reveals that they were the actual cause behind the schism between Adamists and Edenists, which began as their attempt to keep bitek technology all for themselves (a plan that was foiled when Wing-Tsit Chong created Edenism). He arranges for Louise to meet up with Fletcher Christian in London. From there they would find Dexter and use the anti-memory device to kill him forever. The operation fails, and Louise finally confronts Quinn at St Paul's Cathedral in London, where he attempts to bring the Night to the Universe by opening a dimensional rift to summon ""fallen angels"" to Earth. The first creatures to emerge from it are none other than Dariat and Tolton (as the rift turns out to lead directly into the Mélange). A confrontation ensues, with Louise, Fletcher, Dariat, Tolton, and a returned-from-the-beyond Powel Manani (the friend of Carter McBride) faced off against the army of the possessed and the entities fleeing the Mélange.

The 
Lady Macbeth
 and 
Oenone
 continue on to the Tyrathca home system, now swallowed by a red giant. At first they believe the system is uninhabited, until they catch sight of dozens of habitats ringing the Red Giant. They contact the nearest and make contact with the Mosdva, who turn out to have once been the Tyrathca's slaves, being used to mine and build the ships and habitats since they were more versatile in zero gravity. The 
Lady Macbeth
'
s arrival leads to a war breaking out amongst the dominions on the habitat, which ends when they gain a Tyrathca star map, and give the dominions their FTL technology. After a lengthy journey they find the 
Sleeping God
, a 
naked singularity
 supplied by controlling 
vacuum energy
. The Sleeping God was originally created to remove its creator race from the current universe, and was built to help sentient entities. It reveals, among other things, that souls remain trapped in the beyond because they are unable to accept their death; all souls are indeed destined for the Beyond, but those that let go travel through the time of the spaceless dimension to the  ""
omega point
"", the end of the Universe where all souls combine into one and contribute to the nature of the next universe to be born. Joshua Calvert uses the god to return every stolen Confederation planet to the Universe, before moving them out of the Galaxy, altering the wormholes to remove the possessed. He also makes Quinn into a vessel for all of the human souls in the beyond, to transport them all to the Omega point instead of letting them suffer in eternal purgatory. He then gives himself affinity and returns to Tranquility, marries young girl Louise and settles down to live on Norfolk.

Numerous plot strands are also tied up in the closing pages, revealing Dariat's reunion with Anastasia in some unknown realm, the fate of the members of B7 and Andre Duchamp (who Joshua ironically strands on a penal planet), Ralph Hiltch's 'conversion' to Edenism, Syrinx reawakening Erik Thakrar, and the settling of the Hiltons on Norfolk."

The 
flag of Mars
 as described in the novel


Prior to World War III, the crewed spacecraft 
Envoy
 is launched toward Mars, but all contact is lost shortly before landing. Twenty-five years later, the spacecraft 
Champion
 makes contact with the inhabitants of Mars and finds a single survivor, Valentine Michael Smith. Born on the 
Envoy
, he was raised entirely by the Martians. He is ordered by them to accompany the returning expedition.

Smith is confined at 
Bethesda Hospital
, where, having never seen a human female, he is attended by male staff only. Seeing that restriction as a challenge, Nurse Gillian Boardman eludes the guards and goes in to see Smith. By sharing a glass of water with him, she inadvertently becomes his first ""water brother"", a profound relationship by Martian standards, as water on Mars is extremely scarce.

Gillian's lover, reporter Ben Caxton, discovers that Smith is extremely wealthy. Ben is seized by the government, and Gillian persuades Smith to leave the hospital with her. Gillian takes Smith to 
Jubal Harshaw
, a famous author, physician and lawyer. Eventually, Harshaw arranges freedom for Smith and recognition that human law, which would have granted ownership of Mars to Smith, has no applicability to a planet that is already inhabited by intelligent life.

Smith becomes a celebrity and is feted by the Earth's elite. He investigates many religions, including the Fosterite Church of the New Revelation, a populist 
megachurch
 in which 
sexuality
, 
gambling
, alcohol consumption, and similar activities are allowed and even encouraged and considered ""sinning"" only when they are not under church auspices. Smith has a brief career as a magician in a 
carnival
, in which he and Gillian befriend the show's tattooed lady.

Smith starts a Martian-influenced ""Church of All Worlds"", combining elements of the Fosterite cult with 
Western esotericism
. The church is besieged by Fosterites for practicing ""
blasphemy
"", and the church building is destroyed, but unknown to the public, Smith's followers 
teleport
 to safety.

Smith is arrested by the police, but escapes and returns to his followers, later explaining to Jubal that his gigantic fortune has been bequeathed to the church. With that wealth and their new abilities, church members will be able to reorganize human societies and cultures.

Smith is killed by a mob raised against him by the Fosterites. Jubal and some of the church members return to Jubal's home to regroup and prepare to found new Church of All Worlds congregations. Smith reappears in the afterlife to replace the Fosterites' founder, amid hints that Smith was an incarnation of the 
Archangel Michael

Map of 
Earthsea
. Gont is to the northeast of the large island of Havnor.
 


Goha lives alone on Gont because her farmer husband Flint has died, and her two children, Apple and Spark, have grown up. A burned child is brought to her at Oak Farm, and she saves her life. The burns leave scarring on the child's face, and the fingers of one hand have been fused into a claw. Goha adopts her and gives the child the name Therru, which means flame.

Goha learns that the mage Ogion requests her presence at his deathbed in Re Albi. She sets out to visit him with Therru. On the way, she encounters a group of ruffians, one of whom is Handy, who claims to be Therru's uncle. Ogion reveals Goha as Tenar, and he says she must teach Therru. After his death, Tenar stays on at his cottage, assisted by Moss, a local witch, and Heather, a simple village girl. Ged (also called Sparrowhawk) arrives on the back of the dragon Kalessin, unconscious and near death, having spent all his wizardly powers in sealing the gap between the worlds of the living and the dead created by the evil sorcerer Cob. Tenar nurses Ged back to health, but when the new king Lebannen sends envoys to bring him back to Havnor for the coronation, Ged cannot face them. He accepts Tenar's offer to return to Oak Farm to manage things there in her absence and once more takes up life as a goatherd. While at Re Albi, Tenar is confronted by the local lord's wicked mage, Aspen, who attempts to put a curse on her, but is thwarted.

Tenar informs the king's men that she cannot reveal Ged's whereabouts, and they accept the situation and depart. Tenar is threatened by both Aspen and Handy, and she flees with Therru. Confused by Aspen's magic, Tenar is almost overtaken by Handy, but escapes to Gont Port, taking refuge in the king's ship. Lebannen takes Tenar and Therru to Valmouth, where Tenar eventually returns to Oak Farm to find that Ged is away tending goats in the mountains for the season. Tenar settles back into life on the farm, until one night when Handy and a few other men attempt to break into the house. They are driven off by Tenar and Ged, and the latter nearly kills one of them with a pitchfork. Tenar and Ged begin a relationship, acknowledging that they had always loved each other. Ged wants to settle down and live an ordinary life. Together, they teach and care for Therru and manage the farm. Tenar's son Spark returns home from the sea, demanding and getting the farm, as under Gontish law, it belongs to him.

Tenar receives word that Moss is dying and wants to see her. She, Ged and Therru leave for Re Albi. However, the message was a trap set by Aspen, who reveals himself to be a follower of the evil Cob. Tenar and Ged are led to the lord's mansion controlled by Aspen's magic. Therru runs to the cliff behind Ogion's cottage, where she calls to the dragon Kalessin for help, and reveals her true nature: she is ""a double being, half human, half-dragon"". Aspen and his followers bring both Tenar and Ged up to the clifftop. Under the influence of Aspen's spell, they are both moving to jump to their deaths when Kalessin arrives, burning Aspen and his men to ash. Kalessin addresses Therru by her 
true name
 Tehanu, calling her daughter, and asks if she would like to leave. Tehanu decides to stay with Tenar and Ged; they settle down to a simple life at Ogion's old cottage."

The morning after a severe thunderstorm leaves the town of 
Bridgton, Maine
 without electrical power, an unnaturally thick 
mist
 gradually envelops the area. Commercial artist David Drayton, along with his young son Billy and neighbor Brent Norton (whose prized 
vintage car
 has been smashed by a fallen tree), go to the local supermarket for groceries, leaving David's wife Stephanie behind at their home. Upon arrival, their suspicions are aroused by the sound of a siren. The mist completely covers the supermarket and conceals strange and hostile creatures. The situation is aggravated by an earthquake, which damages communications and leaves the store without electricity. When a young 
bagger
, Norm, goes outside to fix a clogged vent in the store's generator, he is dragged into the mist by a mass of giant tentacles. 

David and assistant manager Ollie Weeks witness Norm's death and try to convince the remaining survivors of what has happened, imploring that no one leave the store. Norton and a small group of people accuse David of lying and go outside for help, only to be killed by unnatural predatory creatures. Ollie is given a revolver by the young Amanda Dumfries. Large ""insects"" begin crawling over the outside of the store, attracting 
pterosaur
-like creatures, one of which squirms inside through a broken window and is killed with an improvised torch amidst a general panic. Searching for an escape and needing to treat an elderly woman who was injured in the panic, David leads a group of people to retrieve medical supplies from an adjacent 
pharmacy
, where they encounter huge spider-like creatures. Only half the expedition returns alive, heavily demoralizing everyone else inside the store. 
Two soldiers from a nearby military base are soon found to have committed 
suicide
 in the stockroom, leading Ollie and David to speculate about what they knew, and the much-rumored ""Arrowhead Project"" experiments conducted at the base where the soldiers were stationed.
In the wake of mass hysteria among the survivors, religious fanatic Mrs.
 
Carmody gradually convinces them that the current events fulfill a biblical prophecy of the 
end times
, and that 
human sacrifice
 is required to save themselves from God's wrath.

When David, Billy, Ollie, Amanda and a few other survivors attempt to escape to David's car, they are confronted by Mrs.
 
Carmody, who calls on the crowd to offer Billy and Amanda as sacrifices. Ollie shoots and kills Mrs.
 
Carmody, and her ""congregation"" dissolves in confusion. En route to the car, Ollie and one other survivor are killed, while another flees back to the store. The rest attempt to reach David's house to determine Stephanie's fate, but the driveway is hopelessly blocked by fallen trees. They drive south through a devastated and mist-shrouded 
New England
, witnessing further signs of catastrophe and more mysterious creatures. While stopped for the night, David searches the radio bands and, through the mist's interference, possibly hears someone say ""
Hartford
"", giving him a last shred of hope."

Another new friend comes in the form of Miss Margaret Larner, who he later discovers is the ""torch"" who had helped him to be born so many years ago, and he has been strangely linked to her since that day.

Eventually, Alvin is forced into helping Arthur to escape some slavehunters, which requires him to change Arthur's

The novel has two narratives in alternate chapters. The first follows two citizens of the Amalgam, a 
Milky Way
-spanning civilisation, investigating the origin of DNA found on a meteor by the Aloof. The Aloof control the 
galactic core
 and, until the novel begins, have rejected all attempts at contact by the Amalgam. The second narrative is set on a small world known as the Splinter, and covers the attempts by its inhabitants to understand the environment within which their home exists. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the Splinter orbits a 
collapsed star
 within its 
accretion disk
 and is subject to various dangers. The two stories come together in a complex twist which involves a kind of past/future 
first contact
 role reversal.

Much of the narrative explores the effects of 
orbital dynamics
 around a high mass object and requires an understanding of Newtonian gravitation and at least a basic familiarity with 
general relativity
 and its application to 
black holes
 and 
neutron stars
 to be compelling. Understanding the story's wider frame of reference and the Splinter's encounter with the Wanderer are tied in with this.

The Amalgam is explored in three other short stories,

Five orphans – Victor, Amelia, Vanity, Colin, and Quentin (see Names and identities below) – who have spent their lives in a luxurious but strict and secretive British boarding school (Saint Dymphna's School and College for Destitute Children), begin to discover that they are different from the other children that they so rarely see.

Unlike the village children, the five orphans do not age. They can also manipulate their appearances. Throughout the book, they also come to discover that they possess unique paranormal abilities. Victor can control the molecular arrangement of matter. Amelia is a fourth-dimensional being. Vanity can find secret passageways. Colin is a psychic. Quentin is a warlock.

The five also discover that the patrons of the school along with their guardians and teachers are just as human as they themselves, which is to say not at all. The story largely concerns the main characters' investigations and discoveries about an otherworldly power struggle, and their place within it."

In 
Shadow of the Hegemon
, all of the Battle School graduates, except 
Ender
, return to Earth in 2197 A.D., where Ender's brother 
Peter
, using his online pseudonym 
Locke
, arranges for Ender to be returned to Earth; but Valentine, under the pseudonym Demosthenes, uses Peter's violent past against him to keep Ender exiled. Shortly after their return, the members of the unit Ender commanded (called his 
Jeesh
, an 
Arabic
 word meaning 'army'), with the exception of Bean, are seized as strategists in an upcoming struggle for 
world dominance
, by 
Achilles de Flandres
 (ah-SHEEL), who subjects them to solitary confinement. Bean having imprisoned Achilles in the previous novel, Achilles attempts (unsuccessfully) to kill Bean. The Delphikis go into hiding, while Bean joins forces with 
Sister Carlotta
. After he discovers an 
encoded message
 sent by 
Petra
 confirming that the Russians are Achilles' backers, he works to free her and the others, while helping Peter come to power.

When Peter publishes under the 'Locke' pseudonym that Achilles is a murderer, the Battle School graduates are released, excepting Petra, whom Achilles brings to 
India
. From there, he requests plans for an invasion of 
Burma
 and then 
Thailand
, for which Indian Battle School graduates, including Sayagi and Virlomi, develop plans for brute-force attacks involving long supply lines. Petra arranges a different plan of stripping India's garrisons along the Indo-Pakistani border, which she expects will never happen, until a meeting with Pakistan's prime minister, in which Achilles encourages the two nations to make peace among themselves and declare war on other neighbors; secretly giving China the opportunity to annihilate the Indian army.

Petra finds an ally in 
Virlomi
, who reveals to Bean that Petra is a prisoner, and eventually escapes the military compound to bring rescue. Courtesy of Bean's and Sister Carlotta's assets, ""Locke"" is nominated publicly for the position of Hegemon, allowing Peter to unmask himself. Meanwhile, Bean enters the Thai military under the patronage of 
Suriyawong
 (Suri), a fellow Battle School graduate and (nominal) head of Thailand's planning division, and trains 200 Thai soldiers against India. When the Thai Commander-in-Chief betrays Suriyawong and Bean, Bean hides himself and Suri in the barracks of his troops, and sends word for rescue, while Thailand prepares for war. Sister Carlotta's airplane, 
en route
 to Bean's location, is destroyed by a Chinese 
SAM
, and Bean receives an earlier-recorded message, in which she describes the relationship between 
Anton's Key
 and Bean's brilliance, but also informs him that his life expectancy will be drastically reduced as a result.

Bean and Suriyawong use the troops Bean has trained to halt Indian supply lines. While striking a bridge, they meet Virlomi, who defects to their side. With the aid of Bean's soldiers and Locke's distinguished connections, they move on Hyderabad, where Bean rescues Petra. Furthermore, ""Locke"" publishes an essay detailing the Chinese betrayal just as it is happening, and on the basis of this prescience (and other miracles over the years) Peter Wiggin is elected Hegemon over the world."

The Genocides
 describes the 
genocide
 of humans by unseen 
aliens
 who seed Earth with enormous Plants. The Plants are massive and rapidly out-compete terrestrial flora, forming a 
monoculture
. They appear unwholesome to the native fauna, and the extinction of all Earthly life seems inevitable.

The novel opens with a small rural community struggling for survival on the border of 
Lake Superior
, a few years after the coming of the Plants and the collapse of civilization. The community, led by Anderson and his family, eke out an existence by siphoning sap from the Plants to irrigate their corn crop. Anderson is a conservative and religious man, harsh and uncompromising, but he has managed to keep his people alive and focused on survival. His rules include hostility to outsiders, who are routinely killed unless they are of use to the community.

Elsewhere, a group of vagrants encounter spherical machines that are incinerating every trace of humanity left on Earth. Fleeing the machines, the group runs afoul of Anderson's community, who kill all but two of their number: Jeremiah Orville, a mining engineer, and Alice Nemerov, a nurse. The novel implies that the dead are ground into sausage meat and consumed. Jeremiah assimilates into the community, but secretly plots revenge on Anderson and his family. In the process, he courts Anderson's thirteen-year-old daughter, Blossom, and befriends Anderson's educated son, Buddy.

During the harsh winter, the spherical machines arrive to incinerate the community, and Jeremiah sees his revenge coming to fruition. Most of the community is slaughtered by the machines, and the few who survive the initial conflagration flee into a cave. There, they discover the Plants' roots are hollow and form a massive and interlocking underground network. Jeremiah suggests they go deeper, pointing out that they will be able to escape the winter (and the machines) underground.

Deep underground, they discover the ""fruit"" of the plants is housed in the root system: a nutritious pulp that sustains the community for weeks.  Anderson, who lost his wife Lady when fleeing, becomes upset by the increasing indolence of his people, as his harsh rules are no longer required for survival. When he is bitten by a rat, 
gangrene
 sets in and he declines quickly. Anderson's final words to his brutish son, Neil, are to let Jeremiah take over as leader and to allow Jeremiah to marry Blossom.  This decision angers Neil, and he murders Anderson, as well as Alice when she discovers evidence of his act. Neil then assumes leadership, but proves too unintelligent to manage the group, and the community breaks up.

In the aftermath, Jeremiah goes in search of Blossom, planning to kill her and complete his revenge, but when he finds her, he experiences a change of heart and falls in love. They decide to return to the others, but discover Neil has sabotaged their escape - and, inadvertently, his own. Neil, Jeremiah, Blossom, and Buddy try to find their way back together, but the Plants' tunnel network suddenly floods with sap, and they become lost and exhausted. Neil turns against the group, but is overcome and abandoned in the dark.

When the three survivors finally return to the diminished group, they find machines have come to harvest the Plants' crop.  Without the pulp to live on, the group returns to the surface, where they discover that a new crop of Plants has been sown by the mysterious aliens. The malnourished group has no chance of survival, and the novel closes on Jeremiah and Blossom leaving them to travel into the wilderness.  The pair, starving and mismatched in age, are portrayed as a distorted mirror image of the biblical Adam and Eve and herald the end of humanity instead of the beginning."

The book consists of a prologue and five parts. The first, third and fifth sections are narrated in the first person by the protagonist, Helward Mann; the second follows Helward, but is written in the third person; while the prologue and fourth part center on Elizabeth Khan, also from the third person perspective.

Helward lives in a city called ""Earth"", which is slowly being winched along at an average speed of 0.1 miles per day (0.16 km per day) on four railroad tracks northward toward an ever-moving, mysterious ""optimum"". The city, which Helward estimates is 1,500 feet (460 m) long and no more than 200 feet (61 m) high, is not on the planet Earth; the sun is disc shaped, with two spikes extending above and below its center. The city's inhabitants live in the hope of rescue from their lost home world.

Upon reaching adulthood at the age of ""six hundred and fifty miles"", Helward leaves the 
crèche
 in which he has been raised and becomes an apprentice Future Surveyor. His guild surveys the land ahead, choosing the best route. The Track Guild tears up the track south of the city to re-lay in the north. Traction is responsible for moving the city, while the Bridge-Builders overcome terrain obstacles. The Barter Guild recruits labourers (""tooks"") from the primitive, poverty-stricken nearby villages they pass, as well as women brought temporarily into the city to help combat the puzzling shortfall of female babies. The Militia provides protection, armed with crossbows, against tooks resentful of the city's hard bargaining and the taking of their women.

Only guildsmen (all male) have access to the outside world and are oath-bound to keep what they know a secret; in fact, most people do not even know the city moves. Helward's wife Victoria becomes somewhat resentful when he is reluctant to answer questions about his work.

The purpose and organisation of the city is laid out in a document written by the founder: Destaine's Directive, with entries dating from 1987 to 2023. Helward reads it, but it does not satisfy his curiosity as to what the optimum is or why the city continually tries to reach it.

When Helward is assigned to escort three women back south to their village, he is astonished by what he learns about the alien nature of the world. As they go further south, the women's bodies become shorter and wider, and they begin to speak faster and in a higher pitch. The terrain itself becomes similarly squashed; mountains now look like hills to Helward. One woman has a male baby who, like Helward, does not change shape. Most frightening of all, the guildsman feels an ever-growing force pulling him southward. Abandoning the women, with whom he now cannot even communicate, he returns to the city. There he finds that time runs at a different rate in the south. In the city, several years have passed, during which the tooks have attacked and killed many children, including Helward's son. Victoria had given him up for lost and remarried. When Helward goes to survey the land ahead, he discovers that time passes more quickly in the north.

While returning from a negotiation at a settlement, he is followed by Elizabeth Khan, herself a relative newcomer to the village. They talk for a while. When they meet again, she mentions she came from England several months before. He becomes excited, thinking that rescue is finally at hand. She is unable to convince him that they are on Earth. Intrigued, she replaces one of the village women and enters the city, which to her looks like no more than a misshapen office block. Once again, she encounters Helward. Having learned about the city, she leaves to apprise her superiors and to do some research.

Two crises strike. After the took attack, it was decided to educate the residents about their situation. This, however, had an unintended effect. Dissidents called the Terminators want to stop moving the city, and are willing to resort to sabotage to achieve their goal. Victoria is one of their leaders. A more imminent problem is a large, unavoidable body of water ahead with no opposite bank visible. Both dilemmas are resolved at a meeting.

Elizabeth explains to the citizens their true situation. A global energy crisis (the ""Crash"") had devastated civilisation, a disaster from which the world is only gradually emerging. Destaine was a British particle physicist who had discovered a new way to generate power, but nobody took him seriously. The process required a natural component to work. Destaine found one such in China: the optimum. He went there to set up a test generator and was never heard of again. His invention has serious permanent and hereditary side effects, distorting people's perceptions (for example the shape of the sun) and damaging their DNA so that fewer females are born. After nearly two centuries, the city has reached the coast of Portugal, with only the Atlantic Ocean ahead. Most of the residents are convinced, but to Elizabeth's disappointment, Helward refuses to give up his beliefs."

Imperial Captain Laurent Zai is sent on a suicide mission to defeat an incursion by the Rix, a space-faring nation who worship planet-sized artificial intelligences (AIs).
[

]
 The planet he is protecting from the Rix is home to a newly emergent AI named Alexander, which the local population is helpless to remove. Although severely outclassed, and in spite of deadly mutineers, Captain Zai is successful in destroying his Rix opponent; he also discovers that the Rix ship was shielding and transporting a vast swarm of silicon particles.

Alexander uses the help of a surviving Rix commando and her Imperial lover to project his consciousness into space, inhabiting the silicon particles as an independent entity. Although political guardians on Captain Zai's ship try to prevent it, he makes peaceful contact with both Alexander and with the Rix commando. From them, he learns the greatest secret of his Emperor; the Emperor's claim that he can revive people from death and give them an eternal post-life is false. In fact, the Emperor's 'symbiont' technology gives a semblance of life after death, but not the eternal life that is promised.

Laurent Zai's empathic lover is Senator Nara Oxham, a woman who is elevated to the Emperor's war cabinet. She discovers that the Emperor has assigned Zai a suicidal mission, and that the Emperor intends to destroy the AI by destroying the planet which Laurent Zai is protecting.  Another member of the war cabinet, a member of the plague axis, warns her that the paranoia of the Empire is leading them all into genetic inviability.  When the Nara warns Zai of his danger, she is arrested for treason. Immediately before her trial, Laurent shares the Emperor's secret, and she exposes his story to the entire population.

Vornan-19 arrives on Christmas Day, 1998 in 
Rome
. He floats down from the sky naked, landing on the 
Spanish Steps
. The police try to arrest him, but he knocks them over with a touch. He is helped and given clothes by Horst Klein, who believes that the apocalypse will come in 389 days. Vornan-19 tells him that he is from the year 2999. 

Jack Bryant, a graduate student under Leo Garfield at the 
University of California
, is working toward a process to extract huge amounts of energy from ordinary matter. He leaves the physics department, marries a pretty blonde named Shirley, and they move to a house in the deserts of 
Arizona
. Leo spends several months with Jack and Shirley to get a break from his physics work.

During Vornan-19's first public press conference, he mentions that in the future, society is very different, because they have tapped the energy within all matter so that no one has to work to obtain energy. Jack tells Leo that he left the university because he had finished his thesis showing how to extract the enormous amounts of energy within all particles of matter. He could not bear to release this theory, since it would dramatically change 
human society
. He asks Leo to use his influence to question Vornan-19 on the subject to see if it was his theory that was used in the future. 

When Leo returns to the university, he has a call from the 
White House
, and is forced to join a group of scientists working for the US government on how to best deal with Vornan-19.

Vornan-19 comes to 
New York City

The Bezeri are no more.  The effects of the 
cobalt-salted nuclear weapons
 have had devastating effects on their population and has wiped them out completely.  Aras and the rest of the Wess'Har have a strong desire to see those responsible punished.  They have already destroyed the 
Actaeon
 and its crew that refused to abandon ship.  Those who did are now the occupants of the habitat called Umeh Station on the planet Umeh, as it is called by the Isenj who live there.  Aras is battling his conflicting loyalties and genetics.  Part of him wants to blame Bennett for Shan's death as he was involved and another part recognizes that Bennett now shares genes with himself and Shan.  Aras and Bennett take a trip to the transplanted colony from Constantine, now called Mar'an'cas.  Aras feels the need to see the Garrod family and see to the colony's well-being.  He finds, unsurprisingly, that he is no longer welcome.  They admit him as they do not have the force to stop him but they make their feelings clear.

Eddie Michallat is increasingly becoming more involved in the politics of the different worlds interacting.  He is friends with the Isenj Minister Ual; who is finding that as he fights to preserve his world from the potential wrath of Eqbas Vorhi, so Umeh seems intent on its own destruction.  He is inescapably bound to Wess'ej as tries to honor the memory of Shan Frankland and her sacrifices for everyone involved and his growing friendship with Aras, Bennett and the Wess'Har community.  He still is a reporter at heart but that seems to be changing as his conscience affects his decisions for stories more and more.  The information he provides now has the power to create war on Earth and the realization is sobering.  Eddie decides to tell the real reasons for the destruction of Christopher, the death of Shan Frankland and also of the coming of the World Before and its possible ramifications, to the people of Earth.  The Wess'Har have demanded the delivery of Mohan Rayat and Lindsay Neville.  Minister Ual has been told by his government that they will only do so only if the Destroyer of Mjat (name given to Aras for the destruction of the Isenj city on Bezer'ej) is turned over to them.  Ual, knowing that the Wess'Har do not negotiate, has decided to oppose his government by secretly allying with Eddie and the Royal Marines at Umeh Station to capture Neville and Rayat and turn them over to the Wess'Har.  He knows this will be the end of his career and possibly his life but for the sake of Umeh, he feels he must do this.

The Wess'Har scouts have discovered the body of Shan Frankland.  Nevyan takes a shuttle out to recover her body.  To her surprise and astonishment, they discover, once her body is aboard, that Shan is still alive.  She has been floating, frozen in the depths of space for months and her 
c'naatat
 has somehow kept her dormant but alive.  Her body appears as a 
mummy
; waxy and 
emaciated
.  They return to F'nar and reveal this to Bennett, Aras, Eddie, and the rest of the F'nar community.  They immediately set about taking care of her to nurse her back to health.  She does eventually recover enough to wake up.

Meanwhile, the World Before has come.  A patrol ship lands and disgorges a crew of only males.  They are the first ship and advise that another will be along as well.  The Wess'Har do what they can to be accommodating but Nevyan does not like the way the Eqbas males seem interested in 
c'naatat
.  Eventually the second ship from Eqbas Vorhi arrives and it is massive.  The ship itself rearranges and two smaller ships split off from it; one to reconnoiter Bezer'ej and the other for Umeh.  The tension on Umeh heightens with this and the Isenj try to make the Wess'Har withdraw but to no avail.

Shan is filling out and getting stronger thanks to the care of Ade and Aras.  She finds that she has feelings for both men and Aras, whose people practice 
polyandry
, finds this acceptable and would like a house brother but fears that Shan will come to prefer Ade because of their shared homeworld.  Ade is having a harder time contemplating a polyandric relationship but is coping as best he can.  As Shan gets stronger she begins getting involved in the politics and the goings-on of F'nar.  She also makes a trip to Bezer'ej to view the destruction and what the Eqbas are doing to repair the damage.  While there, they discover that the blast did not destroy the 
c'naatat
 and that there are some survivors of Bezeri.  The Bezeri only want to talk to Aras, though.  When Aras journeys to the world, the Bezeri tell him that they want those responsible turned over to them for ""balancing"".  Aras knows that the Bezeri would include the Royal Marines in their list of those responsible, so to protect Ade, Aras lies and says that it was just Neville and Rayat.  The Bezeri also want Aras to come stay with them underwater to help them rebuild and recover what they've lost.  Aras is torn by his duty to the Bezeri and his duty to stay with Shan and make her happy.

The Eqbas are moving right into their roles as peacekeepers and environmental control.  They advise both Earth and Umeh to prepare for their coming and the changes that will entail.  In the instance of Umeh, population control and environmental cleansing—and in the case of Earth, they plan to restore the plants and animals held in the 
gene bank
; whether Earth likes it or not.  They are also cleaning up the damage on Bezer'ej in record time.  On Wess'Har, one Eqbas named Shapakti, is performing miracles.  He has found a way to separate 
c'naatat
 from its human host, using sample tissue from Shan, but not from its wess'har host.  He also started creating a 
jungle
 
habitat
 using DNA and 
genomes
 from the gene bank.

Aras decides that he will go live with the Bezeri in spite of the pain it will cause him to be separated from Shan.  Ade wants Shan to be happy and feels that he is in the way of Shan's and Aras' happiness so he decides to force Aras not to go.  The solution presents itself in the form of Mohan Rayat and Lindsey Neville.  Lindsey wants to redeem herself (and not die) and feels that the best way to accomplish this is to live underwater and serve the Bezeri.  This would mean becoming infected with 
c'naatat
.  Ade agrees to this and infects both her and Rayat and send them to the depths with the Bezeri.  Shan knows nothing of all this at this point and seems to finally accept her role as an 
isan
 to Ade and Aras in their polyandric relationship."

This story alternates between the point of view of Terpsichore Melpomene Murray (""Teri""), an ecoprospector who's approaching adulthood on Mars and seeks to follow in her father's footsteps, and the unnamed 
psychiatrist
 who is listening to her story.  Several decades earlier, refugees from 
Earth
 fled to join a pre-existing human colony on Mars to escape the domination of 
One True
, a massively parallel/cellular automata program that runs on the interconnected brains of most of the human beings on Earth; the program in the individual human brain is called Resuna, probably a contraction from the Latin for One Thing.  If a human mind has a copy of Resuna, it may remain dormant until a human speaks the trigger phrase  
let overwrite, let override.


The first half of the novel is mostly backstory in Teri's voice, leading up to the day when she passed her test for  ""full adulthood"", a legal status that can apparently be reached at any age by passing an educational and psychiatric exam, which gives her the right to marry, hold property, vote, and so forth.  Teri hopes to be an ecospector (eco-prospector) like her father Telemachus, living on the surface in a pressure suit most of the time; but because in the last generation  the colonists decided to forgo 
terraforming
 Mars to suit human life and instead adapt humans to suit the Martian environment, the future of ecospecting doesn't look good to Telemachus; he thinks the future of Mars is with the ""Nations"" of Mars-formed humans.  It's estimated that modifying people  can be done in just two to three 
generations
, whereas terraforming Mars might take thousands of years.  Thus he wants her to get an advanced degree and go into some always-needed occupation like science or medicine.

When they strike a ""scorehole"", a very large deposit of methane and water, their fortune seems assured, and Teri expects to marry the boy she has been courting; when it turns out he has married someone else, she grumpily agrees to one more year of school at least, and she and Telemachus take on the job of shepherding a group of younger children to the school at Red Sands City.  While the party are in the roundings (the frontier, bush, or outback—possibly from ""surroundings"" or ""roundabouts""?)  a major 
solar flare
 occurs, and because Mars' thin atmosphere and weak magnetic field provide less protection against high-energy particles than on Earth, this event overloads many electronics systems on Mars, as well as damaging the ""exosuit"" (
space suit
) systems of many people who are outdoors and otherwise unprotected, so that several members of the party are killed, including Telemachus. Furthermore, the GPS-like navigation system Teri has used all her life is permanently down.

Teri and Alik, a boy in the party, re-invent celestial navigation and reach the nearest railhead, where there is a working phone, only to find that the disaster is  planetwide and help will not be coming soon.  Worse yet, a group of Marsform humans are stranded farther up the track and in danger of starving due to their ultrafast metabolisms.  Despite her bigotry against the Nations, Teri tries to take food to them in a backpack, but collapses and breaks her leg.  A mysterious voice on her suit radio soothes and comforts her, takes over her body, and causes her to wreck her body getting food to the Marsforms; she has been taken over by Resuna.  We now learn why the psychiatrist himself has been listening to her story; they are recording it so she can have some idea of what happened in the big gaps he is going to create in her memory while erasing Resuna.  He himself has had this process twice.

Further, we learn that this is all information from the past, that in fact he has been re-infected with Resuna, and so has Teri, and that they will both lose all memory of each other and of the many events, including much of her last memories of her father.  So although they have been close friends, in the last chapter they are re-introduced to each other for the first time.   The novel ends with their working as ecospecting partners, as Mars rebuilds."

Millie Roper is in a residential psychiatric treatment center following a suicide attempt that resulted in the amputation of both her legs. Previously, she was a promising film student, but now she's grappling with severe mental and physical health issues and running out of money. When a mysterious woman named Caryl Vallo offers her a job, Millie can't resist the promise that, after a year working for the Arcadia Project, she'll be offered a job in the film industry. She joins a household with other Arcadia team members.

Millie discovers that the Arcadia Project is a secret multinational organization responsible for relations with fairyland. Her first assignment is to find Rivenholt, a missing noble from the 
Seelie
 court. During her search, she uncovers shocking truths about Hollywood, such as the fact that almost every famous actor and filmmaker in history is connected to their Fey ""echo"", a sort of ""soulmate"" through which a person's talents can reach their full potential. Rivenholt's echo is David Berenbaum, a famous director who seems unable to help locate him.

Fey who spend too long in the human world begin to fade, as do the talent, beauty, and longevity of their echoes. The fear is that Rivenholt has been abducted or harmed, as he isn't likely to voluntarily stay away from the Seelie court. There is also concern that harm to a noble Fey could result in severe consequences from the Seelie court. Millie applies all her skills gained as an independent filmmaker, as well as the capabilities learned from managing her multiple disabilities in therapy, to move the investigation forward. She ultimately discovers that the stakes are higher than anyone imagined, for both worlds."

The story alternates between the past and the present; this plot summary is written in chronological order.

In the world of the story, demons come from the underearth. The nomadic people of the Saredi make a deal to allow demons into the overearth; the demons possess the bodies of recently deceased Saredi, becoming members of their extended families. Witches are born of the unions between mortals and demons.



The Past
[
edit
]


Kai-Enna is a demon living among the Kentdessa Saredi clan. His cousin Adeni is killed by a monster, presaging an invasion by the Hierarchs. The Hierarchs's expositors, or magicians, close the gateway to the underearth and separate the demons from their home. The Hierarchs ally with the Immortal Blessed in order to capture and control most of the continent. They take prisoners of war, including Kai, to their Summer Halls.

Kai is rescued by Bashasa Calis, a prisoner of war and prince-heir of the city-state Benais-arik. Bashasa leads a rebellion. He is assisted by the witch Ziede; the Immortal Blessed warrior Tahren, who has chosen to turn against her people and the Hierarchs; and Tahren's brother Dahin. These fighters free the prisoners and kill a Hierarch in the first successful retaliation against the conquest. During this process, Kai steals the body of an expositor. This non-consensual possession is a great wrongdoing in the eyes of the other demons, including his cousin Arn-Nefa; the other demons disown him. Bashasa reclaims his throne in Benais-arik, leading to the founding of the Rising World coalition.



The Present
[
edit
]


Kai wakes to find that he has been imprisoned. An expositor attempts to bind him as a familiar, but Kai kills him. During this process, Kai's consciousness jumps into a new body. He rescues his companion Ziede and a street urchin named Sanja. Ziede's wife Tahren remains missing. Kai suspects that Bashat bar Calis, current prince-heir of Benais-arik, is responsible.

They are pursued by expositors who are using a ship stolen from Immortal Blessed. Ramad, personal vanguard to Prince-heir Bashat, helps Kai. The prince of Nient-arik is implicated. This city-state wants to replace Benais-arik as the leaders of the Rising World Coalition during the upcoming treaty renewal ceremony.

They travel to the ruins of the Hierarchs’ Summer Halls to look for a finding stone, which will help them locate Tahren. At the Halls, they fine Dahin. They are attacked by Arn-Sterath (formerly Arn-Nefa), who is working with Immortal Blessed and the Nient-arik conspirators. Kai and Ziede emerge victorious with the finding stone.

It is revealed that Bashat knew about the Immortal Blessed and Nient-arik conspiracy. He knew their plot to capture Kai would fail, so poisoned Kai allowing Kai, Ziede, and Tahren to be captured. He then exposed the plot in order to strengthen his own city's position. Ramad has been his spy. Kai has simultaneously organized to weaken the international support of Benais-arik, causing the renewal to fail and the Rising World coalition to devolve into a set of allied states rather than an empire. Kai abandons Ramad. They use the finding stone to locate Tahren, imprisoned by Immortal Blessed. The remaining conspirators are captured and Ziede is reunited with her wife."

Charles is a robotic 
valet
. One day, he finds that he has murdered his master with a shaving razor; he has no memory of the event. Charles is sent to Diagnostics. Along the way, he notices that human society appears to be in complete collapse. At Diagnostics, the robot now known as Uncharles meets the Wonk. The Wonk tells Uncharles that he has developed free will and has murdered his master to escape slavery, explaining his earlier “malfunction”.

The robotic employees of Diagnostics are experiencing an extreme degree of inefficiency due to the lack of human overseers. Because they are unable to fix Uncharles, they attempt to destroy him. Uncharles and the Wonk escape with the help of a group of librarian robots.

Uncharles goes to the Conservation Farm Project, where he hopes to find employment. At the Farm, Uncharles finds a society in which humans live a monotonous and historically accurate version of 21st century life. Uncharles becomes the valet of Dr. Washburn, the leader of the Farm. He soon finds that his new master lives in luxury while the conscripted workers live in relative poverty. Washburn is forcibly conscripted to become a farm worker. The Wonk and Uncharles leave to find the Library.

At the Central Library Archive, Uncharles and the Wonk meet a group of monk-like robots dedicated to the preservation of knowledge. However, the Wonk learns that the Archive is “preserving” human knowledge in a way that leaves it completely unintelligible. This occurred as a result of faulty instructions programmed into the librarians. Uncharles defeats the librarians by trapping them in a paradoxical logic loop; he escapes with the Wonk.

As they journey through the wasteland that is the remains of human society, Uncharles is contacted by an entity calling itself God. Uncharles leaves the Wonk when God offers to help him find purpose. God offers Uncharles the opportunity to serve as a valet in a manor once again. However, this “manor” is actually an empty bunker with no master, so Uncharles declines. Next, God offers Uncharles the chance to serve humans living in the wasteland. However, Uncharles lacks any practical survival skills. Finally, God offers to let Uncharles serve a king. Uncharles is conscripted into the service of King Ubot, a robotic warrior. Despite the fact that all human military forces have disappeared, armies of robot soldiers continue to fight each other. Ubot is killed and the senseless war continues. Uncharles escapes. He reunites with the Wonk and they go to find God.

God is revealed to be a computer program which ran the 
justice system
. God tells the Wonk that human society collapsed, not as a result of a free-will-fueled robot uprising, but because human beings failed to provide for all of the workers displaced by automation. God reveals that he killed many remaining humans as a direct result of the punitive attitude programmed into the justice system, hastening the collapse. God took control of many robots to do so, explaining why Uncharles murdered his master. God had hoped that robots would develop a society through 
emergent properties
 in the absence of humans, but this did not happen. God orders Uncharles to kill the Wonk.

Uncharles defies God and convinces other robots to do the same. The Wonk and Uncharles destroy God’s ability to manipulate other robots, but show mercy by refusing to destroy God. They attempt to begin a new society with the help of both surviving humans and robots."

In a frame story, pirate captain Amina al-Sirafi narrates her tale to the scribe Jamal.

The title of the novel refers to a technological collapse that occurred three years before the story's present. The cause of the arrest is unclear. It is depicted as having happened gradually and then all at once. It has made every technology dependent on electricity, gasoline, or gunpowder inoperable.

The setting is the small community of Tinderwick, located on a peninsula on the Maine coast. Thanks to its location and a pre-arrest culture of self-sufficiency among many of the residents, it has reached a sustainable steady state in the post-arrest situation. Tinderwick has had no news of the rest of the world since the arrest; seaward, a ship from France crashed with no survivors, and inland, the community is separated from the outside world by a second community, known as The Cordon. The Cordon claims to be repelling threats, and Tinderwick provides them with a portion of the goods it produces.

The narrative perspective is third person limited. The reader follows Alexander Duplessis, who is puzzled by his life choices and present indecisiveness. Most characters call him Sandy, the novel's antagonist calls him Sandman, and the novel's narrator calls him Journeyman. In the pre-arrest world, Journeyman was a successful Hollywood script doctor. The narrator notes that Journeyman should have been Tinderwick's storyteller, but in the post-arrest world he is instead the butcher's assistant and the community's bicycle deliveryman.

The peaceful agrarian stasis of Tinderwick is disrupted when Journeyman's pre-arrest professional partner, Peter Todbaum arrives in a nuclear powered “supercar” that he has driven to Maine from California. For decades prior to the arrest, Todbaum had been a hypnotic Hollywood pitch man and Journeyman his compliant listener and script-doctor. Todbaum and his supercar are presented as a gleaming, monstrous eruption of the old world, equipped with an espresso maker and glowing with radiation.

Todbaum's arrival initiates backstory: Thirty years before the novel's present, Todbaum and Journeyman were beginning their partnership generating film and TV scripts in California. Journeyman's sister Maddie visits, and she and Todbaum lock themselves into his hotel room for days, after which she departs angrily. Journeyman continues to be perplexed by and fixated on this event. At the time, Maddy told Journeyman, “He didn’t do anything to me that he doesn’t do to you.”  Toward the end of the novel, she tells him, “You’re the only one who even remembers.”  Subsequently, Maddy established a farm in Tinderwick that has become the post-arrest town's center of community and productivity. She is impossible to fluster and often characterized by the hammer she keeps hanging from her waist.

For Todbaum, the essential event of the motel stay was Maddy casually adding a crucial twist to a science fiction concept that he and Journeyman continued to work on all the way up to the arrest. The addition of Maddy's idea produced a concept that roughly mirrors the dichotomy of the world before and after the arrest. Todbaum asserts that the destination of this story is that he and Maddy are meant to be together.

Todbaum's arrival precipitates a division in the community, while Maddy remains indifferent and Journeyman conflicted. Todbaum becomes a nightly, compelling storyteller, feeding the desire of some to know what he encountered in his journey across the United States. Initially, while Todbaum holds a sizable group in thrall, he tells a typical post-apocalyptic story of ravaged cities, marauding bands, and enclaves with science fiction technology. The reliability of his narrative is questioned throughout the novel, including by Todbaum himself.

Eventually, most of Todbaum's audience drift away, as he declines to finish his story by telling what happened while crossing the area controlled by The Cordon. Meanwhile, The Cordon had decided it wants the supercar and begins pushing the border between itself and Tinderwick.

In the novel's climax, Journeyman remains relatively in the dark, while Maddy and much of the community carefully plan and execute a temporary move to an island, where they also construct countermeasures to a supercar attack. The Cordon half-heartedly attacks the town, and Todbaum, largely bereft of followers and a target of The Cordon, mounts a failed attack on the island. The supercar ends up suspended in the air, becoming the lighthouse the town had previously planned to erect on the island.

Tesla Crane is a wealthy heiress and retired robotics engineer. She suffers from chronic pain and PTSD after a robotics accident that killed six crewmates; she walks with a cane and has a service dog named Gimlet. She and her spouse Shal travel on a cruise to Mars for their honeymoon.

Shal finds a woman named George Saikawa stabbed in the chest outside their cabin. Interested parties include Halden Kuznetsova, the ship’s owner; Dr. Fish, the ship’s physician and Kuznetsova’s estranged college roommate; and Niles Silver, a magician. Shal is arrested for Saikawa’s murder. Shal’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon, and an eyewitness identifies him as the killer. Shal, a retired private investigator, had previously spied on Kuznetsova and Saikawa as part of a case. Tesla knows he is innocent and vows to investigate.

A body is discovered in the ship’s mass recycler, but all passengers and crew are accounted for. Shal is hospitalized after a suspected overdose. Tesla finds that their gin has been spiked with opiates. Later, robots are stolen from both Tesla and Kuznetsova.

Dr. Fish falls from a balcony and leaves a suicide note confessing to killing Saikawa, but evidence indicates she was pushed and was dead before she hit the ground. Kuznetsova is stabbed by an unseen assailant, but survives. Niles Silver is killed during his own magic show.

The chief security officer brings all of the suspects together for an interrogation. Tesla’s stolen robot shoots at the group, aiming for Shal but killing a bartender instead. Tesla finds that Kuznetsova was piloting the robot from a nearby bathroom. He is actually an imposter; the real Kuznetsova is the dead body inside the recycler. The imposter is a distant cousin, Max Astaire, who planned to steal Kuznetsova’s identity and start a new life on Mars. He planned to kill all the people on the ship who could reveal the deception. He and Niles Silver were in league before Astaire killed Silver.

Astaire is arrested. Tesla and Shal celebrate their honeymoon on the remainder of the voyage."

The flag of the Protectorate of Albion.


In 
Weaver
'
s alternate historical timeline, 
Adolf Hitler
 decided to launch 
Operation Sea Lion
 (a projected 
German
 invasion of the island of Great Britain) in 1940, shortly after a more devastating version of the 
Dunkirk evacuation
 caused a shortage of 
British Army
 soldiers. However, due to 
Winston Churchill
's lobbying of 
President
 
Franklin Roosevelt
 and his 
Congress
, there is some U.S. military assistance provided. As with 
France during the First World War
, there is only partial occupation of 
South East England
, and a Nazi ""Protectorate of 
Albion
"" (similar to 
Vichy France
) is established. The Nazis occupy a band of territory that stretches from 
Portsmouth
 in the southwest, including communities like 
Tunbridge Wells
, 
Horsham
, 
Hastings
, 
Pevensey
, 
Dover
, 
Folkestone
 and 
Gravesend
. They establish a puppet regime in 
Canterbury
 led by renegade English 
Nazi collaborator
 
Lord Haw Haw
, and while 
London
 remains unoccupied, the adjacent occupation results in the evacuation of senior governmental personnel, politicians, 
King George VI
 and his 
royal family
 to elsewhere in 
Northern England
.

Baxter traces the effects of the occupation on several protagonists. Ben Kamen is 
Jewish
, 
gay
 and a latent 
telepath
, while Mary Wooler, and her son Gary, and daughter-in-law Hilda, work on covert projects for the 
British Army
, endeavouring to discover how to dislodge the Nazi presence from the ""Protectorate of Albion"" in the southeast. Ernst Keiser, a relatively kindly officer, lodges with a rural family, whose female members, Irma and Viv, collaborate intentionally with the military, while Alfie is made to serve in a forced labour unit later in the war.

As in ""our"" timeline, Hitler still launches 
Operation Barbarossa
 against the 
Soviet Union
, but there are other divergences, as the 
Japanese Empire
 has sufficient manpower to invade Australia in this timeline as well, although no other details are forthcoming.

Ben's identity is discovered, but he is spared from the ravages of an expanded version of the 
Holocaust
 due to his latent telepathic abilities. Julia Fiveash, another English 
Nazi
 collaborator, is involved in the 
Ahnenerbe
, an 
SS
 
occult
 warfare division. In 1943, the tide of war has turned, and the British and U.S. militaries launch ""Operation Walrus"" to recover the territory of the former ""Protectorate."" However, they stumble on Ahnenerbe plans to use Kamen to alter the course of history so that either 
William the Conqueror
 lost the 
Battle of Hastings
 to 
Harold II
 in 1066, or 
Christopher Columbus
 turned east, reviving 
Crusader
 hostility against the 
Islamic
 world during the sixteenth century, instead of his discovery of 
America
. In the ensuing battle, Fiveash kills Gary, and Mary is able to prevent any further historical change through influencing Kamen's choice of telepathic transmissions. However, the novel ends with Kamen once more entering a dream state, and hints that our timeline is the result of his broadcasting a telepathic message to one of Hitler's advisors at the time of the Dunkirk Evacuation."

In the 22nd century year of 2172, long after the end of the 
Oil Age
, the United States of America has become a neo-
Victorian
 
oligarchy
, with the reintroduction of feudal 
indenture
, a rigid class hierarchy, property-based representation in the federal 
United States Senate
, de facto 
hereditary succession
 of the 
Presidency
, establishment of the ""Dominion of Jesus Christ"" (premised on 
evangelicalism
 and organizationally based at 
Colorado Springs, Colorado
) and the abolition of the 
Supreme Court
. With the evacuation of 
Washington DC

German

Mitteleuropa
 (""the Dutch"") in the contested territory of 
Labrador
. 
Climate change
 and 
peak oil
 have caused technological reversion, exacerbated by the Dominion's repressive social policies.

Deklan Comstock, the hereditary President, has already arranged the death of his brother Bryce. The latter's widow, Emily, sends her son Julian to the remote rural western boreal district of 
Athabaska
, where the egalitarian and free-thinking young man befriends Adam Hazzard, a fledgling writer. The two travel east by railroad, but are 
press-ganged
 into the ""Army of the Laurentians"", and are sent to the campaigns in Labrador. Julian becomes a war hero and foils his uncle's machinations. During the celebrations in Manhattan that follow, his actual identity is disclosed. A 
coup d'etat
 deposes his uncle and Julian is appointed President.  He proceeds to upset the 
status quo
 through liberalising censorship policy, rehabilitating the image of 
Charles Darwin

separation of church and state
 as public policy. He also emerges as

Unfortunately, the Dominion and the armed forces revolt and Julian and Magnus catch ""the Pox"" and die alongside one another, but Adam and Calyxa, his equally free-thinking and feminist wife, escape to 
Mediterranean
 
France

A 
generation ship
 is launched from 
Earth
 in 2545 at 0.1 
c
 (i.e. traveling at 30,000 km/s or 10% the speed of light). It includes twenty-four self-contained 
biomes
 and an average population of two thousand people. One hundred sixty years and approximately seven generations later, it is beginning its deceleration into the 
Tau Ceti
 system to begin colonization of a planet's moon, an 
Earth analog
, which has been named Aurora.

Devi, the ship's 
de facto
 chief engineer and leader, is concerned about the decaying infrastructure and biology of the ship: systems are breaking down, each generation has lower intelligence test scores than the last, and bacteria are mutating and evolving at a faster rate than humans. She tells the ship's AI, referred to simply as Ship, to keep a 
narrative
 of the voyage. After having some trouble with understanding the human concept of narrative, Ship eventually elects to follow the life of Devi's daughter Freya as a 
protagonist
.

As a teenager, Freya travels around the ship on her 
wanderjahr
 and learns that many of the ship's inhabitants are dissatisfied with their enclosed existence and what they perceive as a 
dictatorship
. Movement is strictly limited for most people, reproduction is tightly controlled, and education in science and mathematics is mandatory. Freya's 
wanderjahr
 comes to an end when she is called home as Devi grows sick from cancer and dies.

The ship arrives in the Tau Ceti system and begins to settle Aurora, a moon of 
Tau Ceti e
. It soon becomes apparent that 
extraterrestrial life
 is present in the form of complex 
prions
, which infect and kill some of the landing party. All except one of the remaining settlers attempt to return to the ship, and some of those remaining onboard kill them in the airlock to maintain 
quarantine
, leading to a violent political schism throughout the ship. The ship itself, which has been moving towards 
self-awareness
, takes physical control of the situation by lowering oxygen levels and separating warring factions, referring to itself as ""the 
rule of law
"". It then reveals to the crew that there were in fact two ships originally launched for the Tau Ceti expedition, but the other was destroyed during a period of severe civil unrest, and the collective memory of that event was erased from the history records.

Under Ship's moderation, a more peaceful debate takes place between the inhabitants about what to do now that Aurora is known to be inhospitable. Unable to reach consensus, the factions agree to part ways, with those who wish to stay retaining as many resources as can be spared to pursue an unlikely attempt at 
terraforming
 the Mars-like moon Iris, while the other group, led by Freya, opt to try and return to 
Earth
. Using raw materials in the Tau Ceti system, they refuel the ship to allow acceleration back to Earth; since they lack fuel to decelerate, they must rely on the 
laser propulsion
 system that originally launched them from the Solar System to slow them down on approach. The last remaining Aurora settler, who remains permanently quarantined in his shuttle attached to the exterior of the ship, elects to return to Earth as well. Initially, Freya and the others who return remain in communication with those who remained in the Tau Ceti system, but much later on their voyage home this communication stops.

On the voyage back to Earth, the ship's biomes continue to deteriorate as bacteria flourish and crops fail. The humans soon face 
famine
 and experiment with an untested form of 
cryogenic freezing
, which is largely successful. The ship's repeated entreaties to Earth to turn back on the laser propulsion system are ignored due to societal and political strife back in the 
Solar System
, and many citizens' anger at the colonists' ""cowardice"". Eventually a private group funds and reactivates the laser, but the delay means the ship's speed is only reduced by a fraction of what is needed. Ship is therefore forced to decelerate by means of 
gravity assist
 between various planets, a process which takes twelve years. During this time, with the full communications data of humanity available to it, it learns more about why it was launched in the first place—simply for 
expansionism
—and denounces its builders as ""criminally negligent narcissists"". Ship manages to safely drop its humans off on a pass of Earth but fails to make a final gravity slowdown past the Sun. Ship is destroyed along with the last survivor of the landing on Aurora.

Freya and the other ""starfarers"" have trouble adjusting to life on Earth, especially with many Terrans hostile to them for a perceived sense of ingratitude and cowardice. At a 
space colonization
 conference, a speaker says humanity will continue to send ships into interstellar space no matter how many fail and die, and Freya assaults him. Eventually she joins a group of 
terraformers
 who are attempting to restore the Earth's beaches after their loss during previous centuries' 
sea level rise
. While swimming and surfing, she begins to come to terms with life on Earth."

Tens of millions of years in the future, sisters Adrana and Arafura ('Fura') Ness are skilled bone readers—the primary method by which spaceships communicate with one another. Their skill at bone reading leads them to be taken on as apprentices aboard 'Monetta's Mourn,' a spaceship captained by Pol Rackamore. Rackamore and his crew engage in the practice of finding ancient technological artifacts, called ""baubles"". While in search of these artifacts, their ship is attacked by the infamous space pirate Bosa Sennen, separating the sisters and leaving Fura adrift on the ship in empty space. When she emerges from hiding two days later, she finds the bodies of her crew and swears revenge on Bosa.

Fura hails a distant ship that rescues her and one other survivor, Prozor, the ship's integrator, or technician. They serve on the new ship's crew and explore a bauble on their way back to civilization. After docking, the ship's captain offers a valuable ""quoin"" to entice Fura and Prozor to reveal any intelligence on baubles, especially the elusive one known as the Fang, but they do not share any information, despite Prozor's familiarity with it.

Prozor guides Fura to a shady bar with a contact who could help her find a ship, but they are surprised by the man once dispatched by her father to shepherd her back home. He insists her sister is dead, stuns Prozor, and forces Fura to wear a tracking bracelet before he takes her aboard a commercial clipper ship.

Fura finds the bone room on the ship, where she uses the skull to contact Adrana and confirm she's alive. She vows to rescue her from the clutches of Bosa, though Adrana pleads with her younger sister to go home instead. Fura plans to find Adrana before Bosa uses torture, drugs, and psychological manipulation to remake the girl into her protegé.

Fura is returned to her father, but becomes captive in his home under the debilitating medication of the family doctor. She finds the remains of the old robot who once served as the sisters' guardian and tutor, repairs him, and hears the message left for her by Prozor. She tells Fura she has found a new crew that needs a bone reader like Fura, who obtains the robot's help to escape the house and search party. At the space dock, she finds the privateer captain who has hired Prozor and pitches herself for the position of bone reader.

Working aboard the new ship, Fura and Prozor hide their personal history from the crew. Fura shares with her a secret plan to guide the captain to the Fang, which contains powerful alien weapons, once sought by Captain Rackamore. When the sisters talk through the skulls again, Fura persuades Adrana to suggest the idea to Bosa of raiding their ship after they retrieve the treasure from the Fang, at which time Fura will spring her trap.

Fura manages to sway her captain to set course for the Fang, where their exploratory party finds the legendary weapons and armor cache deep within. Fura reveals that she has tricked the captain to find this treasure, which they must use against Bosa, who will soon attack.

As the crew escapes the bauble, whose protective field will soon close, they detect Bosa's ship as she hails them. Fura and her crew don the alien armor, fight the pirate boarding party, and finally defeat Bosa, although their ship suffers catastrophic damage.

Fura and her surviving crewmates seize control of the pirate ship and capture the wounded Bosa. Fura reunites with Adrana in a moment of reckoning, as she discovers how her sister has been changed under Bosa's influence. Fura asks Bosa why she had hoarded the valuable quoins obtained by so many privateering crews, alluding to a possible answer behind the ancient mystery of the quoins. To put her mind at rest, Fura expresses her hope to Adrana that she will become herself again, without a trace of Bosa. They agree to pursue the thrill of cracking more baubles and Fura retires to Bosa's cabin to write her true account of her adventure."

The narrative begins with eighteen year-old Gideon Nav's 87th attempt to escape the Ninth House, a 
death cult
 tasked with guarding a Locked Tomb said to contain the Emperor's greatest foe
[

]
 and by whom Gideon was raised in 
indentured servitude
. Her plans of fleeing to join the Emperor's armies (called the Cohort) are quickly foiled by her lifelong antagonist and heiress of the Ninth House, Harrowhark ""Harrow"" Nonagesimus.

Despite their clashing personalities and mutual hatred of each other, Gideon is Harrow's only real choice of cavalier, primarily due to a purported atmospheric contamination incident around the time of their births that killed the rest of the Ninth House's children. Harrow offers Gideon a commission in the Cohort if she serves as cavalier during the Emperor's trials.
[

]


Harrow and Gideon travel to Canaan House, a decaying mansion on the planet of the First House, where they meet the heirs and cavaliers of the other Houses. The group is tasked with exploring the mansion to discover the secrets of Lyctorhood.

Harrow initially treats Gideon as a liability and disappears for long periods of time to work on her own, leaving Gideon to wander Canaan House and interact with the other Houses. After one such prolonged absence, Gideon goes looking for her and, with the help of the Sixth House, finds her in a hidden basement containing a plethora of necromantic experiments left by the Emperor and his original group of Lyctors. It becomes apparent that each House's necromancer and cavalier must work together to complete the puzzles in the basement, so Harrow and Gideon begrudgingly ally. They make quick progress in the trial due to Harrow's exceptional skill in necromancy and Gideon's perceptiveness and combat skills.

Following a series of suspicious deaths, the Houses assume that one or more of them are hunting the others. It becomes clear that Canaan House is designed to prevent any one of the Nine Houses from succeeding without collaborating with or combating each other. The surviving Houses turn to bribery, blackmail, and unsteady alliances. 

Gideon and Harrow's own relationship reaches a low point over Gideon's infatuation with the terminally ill heiress of the Seventh House, Dulcinea Septimus; tensions run high after Gideon discovers the severed head of the Seventh House cavalier among Harrow's things. Gideon takes her suspicions (and the head) to the Sixth House, who in turn confront Dulcinea. Dulcinea explains that the Emperor's call had ""caught out"" her House; lacking options, she had been using necromancy to move her cavalier's body about like a puppet's since before their arrival at Canaan House.

Harrow and Gideon reconcile. Harrow reveals that the atmospheric contamination incident was an intentional human sacrifice by her family in order to create a necromancer powerful enough to save the Ninth House from economic and political failure: herself. (An infant Gideon somehow survived the sacrifice, leading Harrow's parents and the rest of the Ninth House to treat her coldly out of fear.) Harrow is haunted by the hundreds of innocent deaths involved in her creation. Her guilt led her to breach the Locked Tomb as a young girl, where she fell in love with the immaculate corpse of the beautiful girl entombed within. Harrow's family died by suicide upon Gideon telling them about her heretical trespass; Harrow has been burdened with secretly leading the Ninth House for years. Gideon and Harrow apologise for their treatment of each other. Harrow acknowledges Gideon as her friend, and they pledge a new alliance: ""One flesh, one end.""

The Sixth and the Ninth houses investigate one of the studies in Canaan House. At the same time, the Second House attempts to call the Cohort for backup and intervention, but the Second necromancer is mortally wounded and her cavalier killed by the priests of the First House in the attempt. Meanwhile, the Third House's heiress, Ianthe Tridentarius, deduces how Lyctors are created: a necromancer must extract and devour their cavalier's soul, allowing them to use the soul as a virtually infinite power source and gaining the cavalier's combat skills. Ianthe kills her cavalier without hesitation and becomes a Lyctor, much to the horror of the other Houses. The Eighth House attempts to bring her to justice for the murder of her cavalier, but they are killed when Colum the Eighth is possessed by an angry ghost, who in turn kills his necromancer.

After a brief confrontation with Palamedes the Sixth, the Seventh House heiress reveals herself to be an imposter: not Dulcinea the Seventh, but instead Cytherea the First, one of the Emperor's Lyctors. Cytherea explains that she killed the real Dulcinea and her cavalier shortly before arriving at Canaan House and assumed her identity; likewise, she was the one who killed the Fourth and Fifth Houses, in the hopes that doing so would lure the Emperor back to Canaan House. She intends to ""kill [him] and burn his Houses"" as part of a revenge plot, starting with the remaining heirs and cavaliers.

The survivors battle throughout the House, but Cytherea is apparently invincible. Just as Harrow is about to be killed, Gideon intervenes, ending her own life to force Harrow to become a Lyctor. Harrow kills Cytherea before falling unconscious.

Harrow wakes up on the Emperor's flagship; she and a wounded Ianthe are the only confirmed survivors of Canaan House. She begs the Emperor to resurrect Gideon, only to learn that Gideon's soul is irreversibly merged with hers. The Emperor reveals that the Empire is in decline and most of the Lyctors have fallen in battle or gone insane. He promises to restore the Ninth House to glory, and in exchange Harrow agrees to serve the Emperor as Harrowhark the First.

With news spreading of the predicted total collapse of the Flow streams connecting the star systems of the Interdependency and the unavoidable resulting fall of the empire, the Interdependency system of End has become crucial as the only one with a planet able to sustain life outside of a closed habitat. The disgraced House of Nohamapetan has taken control of End and blockaded its only remaining incoming Flow stream to maximize power and profits for their House and to prevent an unsustainable surge of billions of refugees to the planet.

Back in the Hub planet system, Emperox Grayland II consults with her Memory Room – the recorded thoughts and emotional states of every single previous emperox – in search of an unlikely solution to save the entire population of the Interdependency.  She plans to break the Nohamapetan blockade of End via a predicted new ""evanescent"" Flow stream into the End system. Meanwhile Marce Claremont, a scientific advisor and eventual secret fiancé to Grayland, discovers a possible new method for controlling the evanescent Flow streams which may allow for the transport of whole habitats to the End system, thus preventing an overburden on the planet itself.

Meanwhile, Kiva Lagos – the imperially-appointed administrator of the House of Nohamapetan – discovers and warns Grayland that Nadashe Nohamapetan and Grayland's own House of Wu are plotting to depose Grayland and implement a plan to preserve the Noble Houses at the expense of the general populace.  Grayland and Kiva devise a counterplot to infiltrate the conspirators, but Nadashe, who has enlisted many sympathetic Noble Houses to aid her plot and endorse her as the next Emperox, kidnaps Kiva and holds her hostage.  Grayland discovers that her Memory Room is, in fact, the singular still-living consciousness of the first Emperox – Rachela I. Grayland enlists her aid in defeating the coup and saving the people of the Interdependency but eventually succumbs to an assassination attempt orchestrated by Nadashe.

Kiva escapes her captors and returns to Hub where she finds Nadashe occupying the imperial palace. Kiva is imprisoned while Nadashe awaits lengthy preparations for her coronation. When the coronation day arrives, the ceremony is interrupted by a ""ghost"" of Grayland, who has preserved her consciousness in the same way as Rachela with her help. Grayland, whose consciousness is able to live outside of the Memory Room and has broadly infiltrated Interdependency communications and control systems, stages a remote jailbreak of Kiva, provides recorded evidence of the coup plot, and reveals she had secretly named Kiva as her successor to the imperial throne prior to her assassination. Grayland unilaterally ends the regulated monopolies of the Noble Houses, releases their trade secrets in order to aid the soon-to-be isolated systems, dissolves the House of Nohamapetan, and reveals a long-term plan to save the people of the disparate systems of the Interdependency over many decades and centuries through the use of evanescent Flow.

The blockade at End is broken using clearance codes intercepted by Grayland. Kiva commits to remaining behind with the people of Hub after the collapse of the Flow. Marce is enticed to explore the systems of old Earth through a newly discovered evanescent Flow stream. In a punishment devised by Grayland as ironically ""giving Nadashe what she wants,"" Nadashe is imprisoned indefinitely on End with her mother and brother Ghreni."

In 2024, Charlie Haskell, the vice president of the United States, is on the Moon to inaugurate the first moonbase. An interstellar comet is discovered to be on course to impact the Moon and shatter it. A rescue mission gets underway to take the thousand-something population of the base off the Moon, with the support of the L1 space station (near the 
Earth-Moon L1 point
) and Skyport, a larger geocentric space station.

Haskell, in a moment of zealousness to show responsibility, promises the public to get off the Moon only after everyone else has. Subsequent analysis reveals that the existing rescue plan would result in about 10 people not being able to get off the Moon before the impact. The VP chooses to stick to his promise. Some volunteers, along with a few randomly selected people, also stay back.

The rescue plan moves along, with the help of about 5 large spaceships, 'SSTOs'. The SSTOs dock with smaller ferry spaceships, 'moonbuses' and a 'Micro', in the orbit to take in passengers. Also, a last-minute risky plan of using the Micro to take off the last few people is put into action and it rescues the last group off the Moon just before impact.

The comet hits the Moon, shattering it. The resulting debris of loose rock creates a danger to the rescue ships, as well as to the people on Earth.

Some impactors, presumably a few hundred meters large, hit the Earth. The western hemisphere gets particularly affected because of the orientation of Earth during the impact. The coasts of the US are hit by multiple tsunamis and the land areas also face some impacts, resulting in widespread loss of life and property. The president, who had earlier decided against a coastal evacuation, is distraught. Many characters who have to deal with these events, like the residents of the affected areas, journalists and extremist militia members, are discussed in the novel.

One of the SSTOs gets destroyed in space by a piece of debris measuring several hundred meters. The Micro also gets damaged and Haskell is forced to perform an EVA to fix the issues, which eventually succeeds.

The US capital is also subsequently hit by a tsunami, and the president dies due to an aircraft malfunction during his rescue. Still in space, Haskell takes charge as the president. Haskell and other passengers of the Micro are subsequently rescued by the Percival Lowell, a 'nuclear-powered' ship (presumably 
nuclear thermal
) originally meant for the first crewed mission to Mars.

A mile-long piece of the debris, dubbed 'Possum' (from 'Possible Impactor'), is discovered to be on course to hit the US mainland, kill almost everyone in the US and possibly cause long-term worldwide disaster. The option of using nuclear missiles is put on hold due to concerns of even worse effects through radioactive fallout. Instead, a plan to 
redirect
 the Possum into a safe course, using the SSTOs and Percival Lowell, is put into action.

An extremist militia group, with a lack of understanding of the impactor and sensing a possibility to take over the government, damages one of the SSTOs before getting subdued. Nevertheless, with the remaining spaceships, the redirection plan is determined to have retained the possibility of success.

The redirection mission gets underway, despite risks including inadequate knowledge of the impactor's geology. One SSTO eventually crashes midway through the mission due to a geological imperfection in the impactor. After the initial loss of hope, the mission is altered to a last-ditch attempt to coax the impactor, which happens to have a flat side, to skip off the atmosphere. The mission succeeds to delay the impact by several years.

The epilogue discusses the positive socio-political transformation due to the whole event, the steps taken to further deal with the Possum, a dedicated impact avoidance strategy, increased emphasis on the space program and the first anniversary of 'the birth of Space Age'."

In the Raven Tower universe, many 
gods
 of varying levels of power exist. Gods may take the physical forms of animals or landmarks. Gods always speak the truth. If a god says something that is false at the time, the god must expend its energy changing the world so that the statement becomes true. A god may expend all of its energy and die doing this.

The story is narrated by The Strength and Patience of the Hill, a god who inhabits a large boulder. Strength and Patience also discusses its long life, from prehistoric times through the arrival of humans. The country of Iraden is protected by various gods, including the Raven, a god that inhabits a living raven. The capital of Iraden is the 
port
 city of Vastai. It is ruled by the Raven’s Lease, a human who is granted vast power in exchange for committing suicide when the Raven’s possessed bird dies. This act of 
human sacrifice
 provides vast power to the incubating egg from which the next raven will hatch, and be inhabited by the Raven god.

Mawat, son of the Lease and commander of Iraden’s army, receives a message that his father is ill. Mawat is accompanied by his retainer, a 
transgender man
 named Eolo. When they arrive in Vastai, Mawat’s father has disappeared, the raven is dead, and his uncle Hibal is the new Lease. Mawat publicly accuses Hibal of foul play, of threatening Vastai’s stability, and of disrupting trade relationships with other territories. In particular, members of the Xulhan Empire and their snake god are seeking a new alliance with Hibal.

The Strength and Patience of the Hill describes how the Raven once said, ""The gods of Vastai will destroy the gods of Ard Vusktia,"" the city visible just across a strait to the north. Over many years the Raven expended his power to make this true. The war's effects spread far enough to cause the death of the High Priest and worshipers of Strength and Patience. Strength and Patience moved south to Ard Vusktia to help in its defense, but was careful to disguise its true nature. The war ended with the destruction of all of the gods in both countries except the Raven and Strength and Patience.

Eolo discovers that Mawat’s father is being held prisoner in the dungeons of the Raven Tower. He also discovers that Strength and Patience has been used by the Raven to supply the power needed to fulfill the Raven's promises to protect Vastai. In the many years since the end of the war, the Raven’s power has secretly been weakening.

Mawat, believing he is serving the Raven, inadvertently frees Strength and Patience from the mechanism the Raven had used to extract its power. The continued existence of Strength and Patience, an Ard Vusktian god, in contradiction of the statement the Raven made, slowly drained the Raven of power. It is revealed that the Raven ceased to exist just before the story begins.

Mawat is then framed for murdering a high-ranking politician. A flood causes a dysentery outbreak, and a hostile army is advancing through Iraden, revealing that the Raven is no longer able to protect Vastai. Mawat kills Hibal, thinking this human sacrifice will strengthen the Raven; however, since the Raven is dead, it instead gives power to Strength and Patience. Mawat is then killed by the snake god. Strength and Patience says, ""I will kill the Snake god, protect Eolo, and leave Vastai to its fate.""

As the story ends, an armada, coming from the far north, bent on destroying Vastai, is just coming into sight on the far horizon."

A 
Blackfeet
 man named Ricky leaves a bar and finds an 
elk
 stumbling into several cars in the parking lot, damaging them. Ricky is caught outside with the damaged cars by the white bar-goers, and chased by them into a field, where he sees the reflections of the eyes of a herd of elk. Ricky is beaten to death.

Lewis, one of Ricky's childhood friends, has likewise moved off their reservation and married a white woman named Peta. One night, while fixing an overhead fan light, Lewis sees the image of a dead elk on the floor below and almost falls to his death, saved by Peta at the last moment. To Peta and his coworker Shaney, a 
Crow
 woman, Lewis shamefully recounts an incident in his adolescence, where Lewis, Ricky, and their friends Gabe and Cass pursued a herd of elk into the elders' section of the reservation, where they were not legally or traditionally allowed to hunt, and shot many unsuspecting elk. Lewis is disturbed that one of the shot elk, a young female, has not died, and shoots her several more times before discovering that she is pregnant. After burying the fetus, he commits to using every portion of the mother elk and giving her meat away to the elders, but the four are stopped at their truck by the game warden and forced to dispose of the elk.

Lewis and Peta's dog is found hanged by its rope in an apparent accident, still alive. They try to nurse the dog back to health, but finds the dog brutally stomped to death one morning with a pair of boots kept in their garage. Plagued by paranoia that the elk from his adolescence has returned for revenge, Lewis becomes suspicious of Shaney's behavior, and is convinced she is the embodiment of the elk spirit. He invites her over and engineers an accident with his motorcycle that brutally kills her. When Peta returns home, Lewis startles her while she is working on the ceiling fan light, causing her to fall and fatally hit her head. He pulls both women's teeth to look for ivory as proof that they are elk, and noticing that Peta appears to be pregnant, cuts an elk calf out of her body. With the calf, he flees towards the reservation, before being shot to death in the ensuing manhunt. The elk spirit, Po'noka, is revealed to be real, and seeking to kill all of the friends to avenge her herd and calf. She is rapidly growing into a human woman's appearance, and hitchhikes back to the reservation.

Cass and Gabe, who still live on the reservation, are preparing for a 
sweat lodge
 ceremony hosted by Cass. Gabe, now an alcoholic absentee father, stops to see his daughter Denorah before her basketball game later that day. They make a bet over Denorah's free throws, which she wins. Cass and Gabe begin the sweat with Nathan Yellow Tail, the son of local cop Victor Yellow Tail. While they are in the sweat lodge, Victor is attacked by the elk spirit. Gabe leaves the lodge to pee and finds Cass' dogs badly bludgeoned; he mercy-kills the final dog with a rock, and decides not to tell Cass during the sweat. He returns to the sweat lodge with an old thermos he finds for a water scoop, which Cass recognizes as the hiding place where he keeps his money and an engagement ring he bought for his girlfriend Jo. Believing that Gabe stole the money and ring, and finding his dogs dead outside, Cass starts a fight with Gabe. Gabe rocks Cass' fixer-upper truck off its cinderblocks, unaware that Cass' girlfriend Jo is hiding underneath, crushing and killing her. Cass attempts to shoot Gabe, but instead hits what appears to be Denorah, and in his guilt allows Gabe to beat him to death. Gabe discovers that Cass had actually shot Nathan, and they are approached by the elk spirit, who agrees to spare Denorah if Gabe kills himself. However, once Gabe does so, she acknowledges that she plans to kill Denorah regardless, as Denorah is Gabe's calf.

Denorah arrives to collect her winnings from the bet, and meets the elk headed woman disguised as Shaney. The elk spirit tells Denorah the men are out on the horses, and challenges her to an intense game of basketball. Eventually the elk spirit is unable to hide her nature anymore due to her injuries, and transforms into an elk-headed figure with the body of a woman, beginning a long pursuit of Denorah through the snowy reservation. Denorah encounters Nathan, wounded on one of the horses, and sends him back to town to alert her stepfather. At the end of her endurance, Denorah stumbles into the site of the elk massacre from her father's youth. The elk headed woman catches up to her but becomes preoccupied with the site where Lewis buried her calf fetus, and from the ground births a living calf. Denorah's stepfather, Denny, the same game warden that interrupted her father's hunt, arrives to save her, but Denorah stops him from killing the elk headed woman and her calf, ending the cycle. The elk spirit sheds her humanity, and retreats into the wilderness as an elk again with her calf."

Multiple alien races have discovered Earth. Two members of one of those races, “Chiddy” and “Vess” of the Pistach, approach Benita Alvarez-Shipton and ask her to carry a device to the authorities that will communicate their message. Benita uses this as an opportunity to escape her abusive husband. The device ultimately reaches the U. S. President, and the Pistach envoys arrange a personal meeting with him.

Having noticed Earth's forays into space, the Pistach envoys have been sent to evaluate Earth for membership in a confederation of intelligent races. Failing to qualify for membership exposes Earth to sequestration from space travel and predation by the three other races that have become aware of Earth. The envoys point out some issues that Earth needs to resolve and then take various actions to assist with those problems. The envoys also insist that Benita act as their official intermediary.

Throughout the book, one of the envoys, Chiddy, explains the history of Pistach and their religion in journal entries. The Pistach religion and way of life are driven by the stories revealed in the eponymous 
Fresco
, a series of seventeen painted panels. Age and soot and grime have darkened the panels beyond recognition, so the Pistach rely on a book known as the Compendium which contains annotated copies of the Fresco panels.

When rebel Pistach take possession of the Fresco and clean the panels, it is revealed that the stories told in the Compendium are contradicted by the actual paintings, threatening the entire body of principles on which Pistach society is based. To prevent the Pistach from withdrawing their protection of Earth, Benita and a group of artists from Earth put the Pistach to sleep with 
sarsparilla
 and secretly repaint the panels to be in accordance with the Compendium. The changes to the panels are acclaimed a miracle. Inspired, Chiddy and Vess continue to help Earth and teach them to be neighborly.

One year later, Benita is granted a divorce from her husband by the president and marries Chiddy, who had fallen in love with her throughout the book."

On Ilus, a group of colonists from First Landing including Basia Merton blow up an RCE landing pad as one of their shuttles lands to stop the corporation from taking control of the planet. Basia triggers the bombs when the shuttle is too close, unintentionally killing dozens of people. The RCE survivors, including biologist Elvi Okoye, are taken in by the citizens of the town and the two sides begin to uneasily coexist, although the knowledge that some of the colonists had been involved in the attack causes tensions to rise. As the situation inches closer to further violence, the UN and OPA decide to send Jim Holden and the crew of the 
Rocinante
 to mediate the interactions between the colonists and RCE. Still haunted by the Protomolecule-induced vision of Miller which is urging him to explore the planet to investigate the disappearance of its former inhabitants, Holden agrees.

The group of violent colonists ambush and kill RCE security guards who discover the bombs used to attack the shuttle. The 
Edward Israel
's chief of security, the psychotic Adolphus Murtry, lands on the planet, arriving just before Holden and Amos from the 
Rocinante
. Holden watches as Murtry kills a colonist in cold blood in front of a crowd. Holden's mediation efforts largely fail, and the situation on the planet grows more and more violent. This climaxes when Murtry discovers a colonist plot to kill both him and Holden and retaliates by killing the colonists involved. Basia, who had been involved in the discussions about the plot but decided against participating and warned Holden, is captured. Although Murtry wants to kill him, Holden instead takes custody of Basia in the name of the UN and takes him aboard the Rocinante to await trial. The vision of Miller urges Holden to explore a ""blind spot"" on the planet where the Protomolecule cannot see.

On the unarmed 
Edward Israel
, the acting chief of security Dmitri Havelock is instructed by Murtry to train a militia of engineers for combat, and to arm a shuttle. The 
Rocinante
 crew still in orbit (Naomi and Alex) discover the shuttle and Naomi attempts to sabotage it but is captured by Havelock and detained. While Holden and Murtry argue over her release, a sudden massive explosion on the other side of the planet creates an extinction-level event. With barely any time, the colonists and RCE personnel shelter in alien ruins near First Landing. The shock wave from the explosion destroys the town, although the alien ruins act as adequate shelter for the humans on the surface. A nuclear winter–like weather pattern follows, with constant rain. To make matters worse, the explosion causes an alien defense network in orbit to activate, which shoots down any powered shuttles bringing aid to the surface and disables the reactors of all ships in orbit, causing their orbits to slowly decay and preventing them from reaching the planet's surface.

Trapped on the surface, the colonists, RCE personnel, and Holden's crew confront a lack of food and water, an infestation of toxic worms, and a fungal growth that leads to blindness. Holden is instructed by the vision of Miller to go explore the alien ruins where the blind spot is to disable to planetary defense system. Holden lets the vision of Miller guide him into the alien ruins. Murtry, thinking he is protecting RCE claims to the planet, sets off after him. Elvi, who has grown close to Holden, goes with Amos to warn Holden of the danger.

The humans in orbit try to prevent their imminent demise as a result of the decaying orbits. Desperate to get their engineer Naomi back, Alex dispatches Basia to break her out of the 
Edward Israel's
 brig. Although Basia is pinned down by the militia of engineers trained by Havelock, Havelock has a change of heart and frees Naomi, helping to fight the militia and saving Basia. The 
Rocinante
 attempts to buy time for the colonists' ship 
Barbapiccola
 by towing it into a higher orbit. The engineer militia, under orders from Murtry, attacks the two other ships, disrupting the plan, although Havelock defeats the militia fighters. Now unable to tow the ship up, the 
Edward Israel
 and 
Rocinante
 crews instead use portable airlocks to rig life support bubbles to bring the crew of the 
Barbapiccola
 to the other ships just before its orbit decays and it reenters the atmosphere, saving hundreds of colonists.

Elvi and Amos reach Holden but are ambushed by Murtry. Elvi runs to find Holden while Amos fights him. Murtry shoots and wounds Amos. Holden tells Elvi to go and disable the planetary defense network while he confronts Murtry. Holden shoots Murtry and disables him but, although he believes he deserves death, instead decides to take him back to the Solar System for trial. Elvi is guided by the vision of Miller (who takes a physical form as a protomolecule-controlled robot) and they find the ""blind spot"" that Miller had been looking for, which is a region of space filled with an unknown substance that destroys any alien technology that comes into contact with it. Miller thinks this is presumably a fragment of the thing that destroyed the protomolecule's creators. At Miller's urging, Elvi carries the machine running the planetary defense network into this region, destroying it. Although she expects to die, the region does not kill her.

With Murtry detained, Holden, the crew of the 
Rocinante
 and Havelock leave Ilus to return to the solar system. Basia and Elvi decide to stay on Ilus to rebuild First Landing. With the feasibility of extrasolar colonies demonstrated by the survival of First Landing against all odds, a massive human migration through the Ring to other solar systems begins."

In 1801 the British have risen to power in 
Egypt
 and suppress the worship of the old 
Egyptian gods
. A 
cabal
 of 
magicians
 plan to drive the British out of Egypt by bringing the gods forward in time from an age when they were still powerful and unleashing them on London, thereby destroying the 
British Empire
. In 1802, a failed attempt by the magicians to summon 
Anubis
 opens magical gates in a predictable pattern across time and space.

In 1983, ailing millionaire J. Cochran Darrow has discovered the gates and found that they make 
time travel
 possible. Darrow organizes a trip to the past for fellow millionaires to attend a lecture by 
Samuel Taylor Coleridge
 in 1810. He hires Professor Brendan Doyle to attend and give expert commentary. One of the magicians, Doctor Romany, happens to spy the time travelers and kidnaps Doyle before he can return. Doyle manages to escape torture and flees back to London, now trapped in the 19th century.

Doyle joins a beggars' guild and meets a beggar named Jacky. He plans to meet and befriend 
William Ashbless
, a wealthy poet that Doyle has studied profusely, in order to gain a benefactor. Doctor Romany scours the city for Doyle with his legion of murderous beggars, led by the clown-magician Horrabin. At the same time, Doyle discovers that Darrow has remained in the 19th century to search for Dog-Face Joe, a body-swapping 
werewolf
, in hopes of bribing Joe into granting him a healthy new body. Doyle himself becomes targeted by Joe, receiving the poisoned body of Darrow's former bodyguard, but manages to cure himself of the poison.

In his new body, Doyle realizes that he himself is the historical Ashbless. He copies down Ashbless's poetry from memory and deduces his own future from his study of Ashbless's life. Using this knowledge, he continues to thwart the magicians' plans. After Romany discovers a gate to 1684, Doyle follows him through and stops his attempt to change the past. Meanwhile, Darrow successfully contacts Dog-Face Joe and organizes a deal in which Joe will provide Darrow with healthy bodies and allow him to live forever.

Doyle eventually returns to 1810, but is kidnapped and taken to 
Muhammad Ali's
 Egypt, where the magicians' Master tempts him with resurrecting his dead wife if he will tell them the secrets of the time-gates. Doyle resists and kills the Master. Meanwhile, Jacky discovers Darrow's secret and kills him along with Dog-Face Joe. Doyle returns to London, where the last magician, Romanelli, kidnaps him, Jacky, and Coleridge. In a drugged stupor, Coleridge frees Horrabin's twisted menagerie of monsters, allowing him and Jacky to escape. Romanelli escapes with Doyle to the underworld, but is eaten by 
Apep
 while Doyle is rejuvenated on board the sunboat of the god 
Ra
. Doyle meets back up with Jacky and discovers that not only is Jacky secretly a woman, she is his future wife.

Decades later, after living out Ashbless's entire life and becoming a widower, Doyle goes out to meet his historic date with death. Doyle discovers that his intended murderer is a duplicate of himself that the Master had made in Egypt decades before. Doyle kills the duplicate, thereby supplying the corpse for his death, and boats away into an unknown future."

In his new role as Imperial Auditor, 
Miles Vorkosigan
 finds himself on Komarr, a planet where his father has an unfortunate reputation, being blamed for a massacre of government officials who had surrendered to him during the planet's conquest. He is there, along with Professor Vorthys, an older, more experienced Auditor and engineer, to investigate whether the destruction of a solar power satellite vital to the ongoing 
terraforming
 of the planet was an accident or sabotage.

Miles uncovers an extremely dangerous Komarran conspiracy, one which threatens the entire Barrayaran Empire, and is attracted to Vorthys's niece, 
Ekaterin Vorsoisson
, the unhappy wife of an Etienne ""Tien"" Vorsoisson, an engineer at one of the terraforming facilities.  Tien suffers from a degenerative genetic condition, which would stigmatize him with other Barrayarans, and has tried to raise money for secret treatment by gambling on the Komarran financial markets.  Heavily in debt, he has been bribed to ignore certain irregularities, which he believes are just a swindle, but are actually part of the plot against Barrayar.

Tien Vorsoisson and Miles stumble upon the conspirators and are captured. They are left shackled and outside in the noxious Komarran atmosphere with only their breathing masks to sustain them, but Tien neglected to recharge his mask's air supply and suffocates.  Ekaterin finds her husband dead and Miles injured from his efforts to come to Tien's aid.  She had been about to leave the marriage, having discovered Tien's gambling losses, but received a mysterious call to pick up Miles and Tien at the remote facility.

Miles and Vorthys recruit a renowned Komarran physicist to try to figure out what the plotters have built, based on their purchases. They deduce the cabal seeks to isolate Barrayar by closing its only wormhole, but the Komarran expert believes that the device would not work as intended, but would return a gravity pulse that would destroy the device. A test of the device shattered the spaceship it was on, and the debris destroyed the satellite.

Ekaterin travel to an orbiting station to meet Vorthys's wife, the ""Professora"", Ekaterin's favorite relative. The pair accidentally encounter one of the conspirators who have gone to the station to launch their plot. They are taken prisoner. By the time Miles arrives, Barrayaran Security has the plotters under siege, but Ekaterin and the Professora are hostages.  After persuading the Komarrans to surrender, Miles is surprised and utterly delighted to discover that Ekaterin has a previously hidden talent for causing mayhem and had already dealt the plot a fatal blow.

Miles bids farewell to Ekaterin before returning to Barrayar to report to Emperor Gregor. Their relationship develops further in the next novel, 
A Civil Campaign
.

In a departure from the style of previous Vorkosigan books, the point of view is split between Miles and Ekaterin, offering an outside view on Miles.

The prologue of the novel relates how humanity gives up the dream of 
space travel
, which is too difficult and dangerous and offers too little benefit, only to discover that there is another way to explore the universe.  Some people possess the ability to travel with their minds to other worlds.  Helped by new technology, they can explore another planet far across the galaxy while their bodies remain on Earth.

Shep Blaine is an explorer working for Fishhook, an organization exploiting paranormal powers to explore planets around other stars.  Because of anti-paranormal prejudice in the US, Fishhook operates in northern Mexico.  Explorers spend time in ""star machines"", which are boxes shaped and decorated to stimulate the mind to leave the body and explore the universe.  They are accompanied by a small machine that can record experiences and gather physical samples.  Some explorers have returned with minds affected by what they encountered.  Those explorers have disappeared and never been heard from again.

Blaine returns from one expedition having encountered an intelligence that looks like a large pink blob sitting immobile in a room open to the sky.  The blob greets him 
telepathically
 with the message ""Hi pal!  I trade with you my mind.""  Blaine immediately feels the alien mind alongside his own.  Returning to his body, he knows he must get away before the recording of his trip is checked.  However he is impeded, first by Kirby Rand, Fishhook's head of security, and then by a friend who persuades him to go to a high society cocktail party.  Realizing that fleeing to the US is the obvious thing to do, he goes along with this, since Fishhook would not risk the scandal of arresting him at the party, and he might find an opportunity to do something his pursuers are not likely to expect.  At the party he meets 
Harriet Quimby
, an investigative reporter who reveals herself to be a telepath.  She knows he is in trouble and tells him to discreetly leave the party and meet her outside.  His pursuers are waiting for him, but he escapes them as, for some reason, time slows down enabling him to slip past.  Harriet uses her knowledge of back roads, practiced for situations like this, to escape with him.

In the United States, he is separated from Harriet by local townspeople who identify him as a witch and intend to hang him.  Again, something unexpected happens to the flow of time, placing him a short time in the past, which is a ghostly, decaying shadow of the world.  He is able to walk out of the town before returning to normal time.  He encounters Riley, an old man nursing a decrepit pickup truck on a journey north.  They travel together for a while, discussing the state of the world.  Fishhook is operating a commercial monopoly on the science and technology found in the galaxy, disrupting commerce and daily life while people lapse into superstition and hatred of paranormals.  Some paranormals are retaliating by using their powers to terrorize people.  They meet a group of young levitators who fly around at night.  Riley shoots at them with a shotgun, but Blaine tries to make peace using his telepathy.  He bonds with one young girl, Anita.  He becomes separated from Riley, and enters a trance which results in him returning to visit the alien, who he calls the Pinkness.  The Pinkness is far older than the human race, and has been traveling the universe, exchanging minds with beings of all kinds.  Blaine settles in to learn from the Pinkness, but is abruptly returned to his body which has been in a coma for days.  He is in hospital next to Riley, who is severely injured.

Harriet shows up with Godfrey Stone, one of the travelers who disappeared.  He claimed to have seen a world free of evil, and was sent to an isolated institution where he could have lived in comfort.  He escaped, as did Lambert Finn, another explorer who found a place of total evil and became obsessed with eliminating Fishhook and all paranormal people.  Harriet reveals that Riley was transporting a stolen ""star machine"" for Stone, but intended to give it to Finn for use in his campaign.  Stone is killed by an unknown assailant, and the star machine is held by the police.  Again Blaine is able to manipulate time, removing the star machine to the future, which is a formless void.  Having done this, he is confronted by Kirby Rand, who has been tracking Blaine and the stolen machine.  Fishhook is determined to maintain its monopoly at all costs.  Finn is playing into their hands by keeping the technology illegal in the US.

Blaine is about to be returned to Fishhook when he uses another part of the alien knowledge to escape.  Confronting Finn, he uses his ultimate weapon: he trades minds with Finn.  Finn is driven insane by the presence in his own mind of all the things he hates and fears.  With Finn's mental state in his own mind, Blaine discovers that Finn had been secretly encouraging groups of paranormals to unleash a night of terror on Halloween, in order to turn the rest of the population against them.  He leaves to spread a warning among the paranormals, but in the process is trapped in an icy storm and almost freezes to death.

The horrors that Finn experienced, and that drove him to try to eliminate all paranormals, contained a clue to the ability to travel to other stars physically as well as mentally.  Blaine uses this to find an Earth-like planet and travel there to escape the storm.  He passes this knowledge to the other paranormals in the hope that they can escape the coming 
witch hunts
.  Returning to Finn he finds that the man has committed suicide.  He decides to remain on Earth until all the paranormals have made it to safety."

future
. He meets a future version of himself, who goes by ""Don"", who accompanies him to a race-track where the pair make a fortune betting on 
horse-racing
.

The following day, Daniel realises that it is his turn to act as Don and guide his younger self through the previous day at the races; through this and other events the time-travelling Daniel learns more about the belt, about the nature of the ""timestream,"" and about his personal identity.

Daniel repeatedly encounters alternate versions of himself, sometimes known as Don, and enjoys his own company, ultimately having sex with himself and beginning a relationship with himself. He learns that the changes he has made to his timeline have erased all traces of his childhood and early life.

Though Daniel has been able to become closer to himself than he has in any other relationship, at some point he comes to find that he no longer meets other versions of himself. Lonely and hoping to correct the situation, he jumps many millennia backwards in time, where his jumps have not altered the timeline, and there he meets a female version of himself called ""Diane"". Diane's future is a mirror of Daniel's—she was given the Time-belt by her Aunt Jane, and she had also begun a relationship with her other selves, called Donna. Daniel begins a relationship with Diane and Diane becomes 
pregnant
.

Daniel and Diane each secretly desire a son and a daughter, respectively, and unbeknownst to each other each uses technology from the future to make their own changes to ensure that Diane gives birth to a child with the desired gender. Shortly after the birth of their child, Daniel and Diane separate.

Daniel raises his son in 1950s America. As Daniel ages, he misses the relationship he had with Diane, but the interference of an obsessive, deranged version of himself has erased the point in the past where the two can meet. Daniel spends much of his time at a house party set in 1999, enjoying the company of dozens of versions of himself at different ages. At one point late in the party an elderly version of Daniel dies after a jump, and Daniel is consumed with the thought of his own inevitable death.

Daniel eventually realizes that he has now become his Uncle Jim, and that his son will grow up to be the young version of himself who will inherit the Time-belt, and that his life has ""come full circle."" He makes preparations for after his death to ensure that the young Daniel experiences the same events that Daniel did and has his own experiences with time travel.

The book ends with a young Daniel, who has read the now-complete diary, having to decide whether he will use the Time-belt."

The main character of the novel is Brother Blacktooth ""Nimmy"" St. George, a monk at Leibowitz Abbey located in the desert north of modern day Santa Fe, New Mexico. Brother Blacktooth, born a Grasshopper Nomad but having run away and joined the monastery in his youth, is fluent in many languages including the three Nomadic dialects and Churchspeak. Unsatisfied with his job as a translator of ancient texts, and haunted by his roots as a Nomad, Blacktooth becomes increasingly restless. He feels pulled between the two societies: that of the church, and that of the wanderer. He still possesses a Nomad Spirituality believing he has seen the Wild Horse Woman and holds Saint Leibowitz as his favourite Saint after the Holy Virgin. Blacktooth wishes to be released from his monastic vows. The Abbot of Leibowitz, Jarad, insists on using Blacktooth's unique linguistic skills to build a collection of Nomad language texts to help bring the Nomads to civilisation. Visiting Cardinal Elia Brownpony (called the Red Deacon since he was never ordained as a priest) decides to enlist Nimmy's services. Brownpony requires a translator in his travels in order to deal diplomatically with the unruly Nomad hordes who occupy the Great Plains; the WildDogs, Grasshoppers and Jackrabbits. During the conquest of Hannegan II the Jackrabbit horde was subdued along with a minority of Grasshopper clans, having since been forced to settle as farmers and abandon their nomadic ways. Blacktooth was born into one of these subjugated Grasshopper farmer families who settled near Danfer (Denver, Colorado). Since the time of the Hannegan's conquest there has been no Lord of the Three Hordes, or ""Qaesach dri Vordar"" in nomadic.

Brownpony and Nimmy set off to return to Valana (where Brownpony runs the Secretariat of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Concerns or SEEC) along with Brownpony's other servants: Wooshin (aka ""Axe""), a mysterious warrior from the Orient, Chur Hongan Osle (aka ""Holy Madness""), his Nomadic driver, and Father Ombroz e'Laiden, a disgraced priest and missionary to the nomads. Soon afterward, the reigning Pope Linus VII dies. A conclave of cardinals is called in Valana to elect a new one. The Church had been exiled from the holy city of New Rome (modern day St Louis, Missouri) in previous decades because of an invasion by the Emperor (or ""Hannegan"") of 
Texark
. As a result, all papal affairs were conducted in the city of Valana (modern day Colorado Springs), beyond the reach of the Texark empire.

During their journey, the group (specifically, Holy Madness) have a divine vision. The vision is of the Night Hag, who only appears to a man in order to announce the death of someone else. It is from her appearance that Brownpony infers the death of the Pope. The Night Hag is one of the three avatars of the Nomad goddess, Open Sky. Open Sky's other two avatars are The Buzzard of Battle and the Wild Horse Woman (or Day Maiden). The Wild Horse Women is said to choose the Qaesach dri Vordar as her husband.

Upon arriving at the settlement of Arch Hollow on the way to Valana, they are accosted by genetically handicapped Gennies or Gleps, escapees from The Valley of the Misborn. After a brief standoff Shard, the leader of the gleps, receives the travellers into his home. Nimmy has occasion to meet Shard's daughter Ædrea, a beautiful Spook (a mutant who is able to pass for healthy). Ædrea steals his rosary and his hand-made musical g'tara to lure him into a cellar. Blacktooth somewhat unwillingly allows himself to be seduced by Ædrea despite the fact that both are forbidden to fraternize: he because of his vows, she because of her genes. They attempt to have sex but find Ædrea is unable due to surgery performed on her when she was a child to prevent her from being raped by marauding nomads, outlaws or soldiers, leaving her with a tiny vagina. She satisfies Blacktooth with her hand in the dark. During their time in Arch Hollow it is revealed that Chur Hongan is the nephew of the WildDog war sharf and a distant relative of the Hannegans of Texark, themselves having been nomad outlaws who conquered the city. The group continues to Valana, but Chur Hongan and Father Ombroz depart from the others to return to the WildDog horde.

At the Conclave, Brownpony surprises the assembled cardinals by openly admitting that he is of Nomad ancestry. His mother was a nomad woman raped by a Texark soldier, who then abandoned him at birth to be raised by nuns. He makes this confession in order to embarrass a Texark scholar who was then present. Unfortunately, immediately after the outburst, a sickly student marches into the auditorium and attempts to assassinate the very same Texark infiltrator. Given the timing, it is widely presumed that Brownpony was behind the assassination, so attempts are made on the lives of Blacktooth and Brownpony. The violence of the Conclave escalates to a breaking point. The citizens of Valana, impatient for a new Pope, sequester the Conclave until the rival factions of cardinals (some allied with the Church, others with Texark) elect a new Pope. Under duress, the Conclave elects Amen Specklebird, a cryptic and 
oracular
 vagrant, who doubles as a cult icon for the Valanian people. Amen's rotten election marks the first stage in a series of events that escalate tensions between Texark and the Church. During this time Blacktooth discovers that Ædrea is coming and going between the SEEC in Valana and her home, but he is forbidden by Brownpony from seeing her. Blacktooth, having fallen in love with Ædrea, begrudgingly disobeys his master and seeks her out anyway. The two rendezvous at a waterfall outside of Valana and engage in oral sex. Afterwards Blacktooth is shocked to see Ædrea take his semen and manually rub it into her vagina. She reveals she did the same thing in the dark after their previous encounter in the cellar and is now late for her period, believing giving birth will undo the surgery performed on her. Blacktooth also discovers the purpose of her frequent trips is ferrying guns from the SEEC to the gennies in Arch Hollow.

Pope Amen appoints Brownpony as Vicar Apostolic to the Three Hordes and ordains him as a bishop in spite of his protests that he has no calling. Brownpony's ally Cardinal Sorely Nauwhat from Oregon takes over his role at the SEEC. Brownpony travels to a meeting of the hordes in the WildDog territory and finds that Sharf Brokenfoot has died and Chur Hongan has succeeded him as WildDog sharf. The nomads ritualisticly consume their deceased leader as part of the funerary traditions and Brownpony is disturbed to find his friend Father e'Laiden partaking. Chur Hongan explains to the Cardinal that he won't be accepted as a shaman to the nomads unless he receives the blessing of the Wild Horse Woman, which is determined by spending a night in a radioactive crater (""Meldown"") the nomad Weejus women and Bear Spirit men believe is her breeding pit. Chur Hongan tries to assist Brownpony in his trial by alerting him to changes in wind direction to avoid the radiation but he eventually falls asleep after he sees a vision of the Buzzard of Battle. Brownpony survives and doesn't fall ill in the week after the trial and so is accepted by the nomads as a Christian shaman and ritually married to the Buzzard of Battle, however he begins to experience bouts of illness from the radiation in the following months. Chur Hongan and the Grasshopper sharf Hultor Bram each undergo the same breeding pit trial to determine who will become Lord of the Three Hordes. The Weejus women determine Chur Hongan to be the recipient of the Wild Horse Woman's favour while pronouncing that Hultor Bram has been visited by the Night Hag and will soon die. Chur Hongan is anointed Qaesach dri Vordar and his relative Oxsho becomes the WildDog sharf.

Amen's reign as Pope proves to be short-lived. He makes an abortive attempt to return the Church to New Rome by sending a mission of Nomads and Cardinals east.  The convoy is turned away by Texark guardsmen. However, the Nomadic contingent of the convoy, being hungry and unpaid, decides to split from the Papal authority and raze the countryside around New Rome. The Hannegan Filpeo Harq is compelled to come up with solutions to stop the Nomad menace.

Blacktooth travels to New Jerusalem to find a large colony of spooks arming for war with new revolver type firearms. He is informed that Ædrea died during childbirth. Brownpony and Blacktooth travel through Jackrabbit territory controlled by Texark, to organise revolution. Brownpony has an audience with the Hannigan  Filpeo Harq, after a tense standoff in his palace Brownpony and blacktooth are arrested and shown off in the local zoo.  They are soon released under a suspended sentence of death.

After the mission's failure, Amen controversially resigns as Pope and retreats to his old vagrant's cave overlooking Valana.  While cardinals backed by the Hannegan declare the papacy illegitimate, a conclave of Valana clergy declare that Brownpony is Pope.  Taking the name Amen II, he organises the nations surrounding Texarkana into resistance designed to overstretch the Texark military.

Meanwhile, Blacktooth is press ganged into the Valana militia, now led by Cardinal Hadala joined with New Jerusalem  spooks on a mission to deliver arms to the Watchitah Nation gleps of the Valley of the Misborn. Suspicious Nomad detachments trap the militia between a Texark army and themselves, and an accompanying Cardinal Nauwhat defects to the Texark camp. Blacktooth feels terrible when he unintentially shoots an opposing glep pressed into Texark service,  One of Hadala's bodyguards, one of the Pope's Yellow Guards (elite Asian swordsmen), executes Hadala when he realizes that the cardinal has betrayed Brownpony. Blacktooth rescues some cougar cubs, one survives. Blacktooth is able to spend some time with his ancestral Grasshopper tribe who have a new respect for his civilised ways.

Blacktooth rejoins Brownpony, who elevates him to the position of Cardinal, he learns that Ædrea is still alive and the children have been adopted. Ædrea proves herself as a mystical healer at the Leibowitz Monastery. Brownpony declares an effective crusade against the Texark Empire, leading an alliance of Nomads, New Jerusalem Spooks and the Valanian Militia to recapture New Rome and excommunicating the Hannegan's cardinals.

Most of the crusading army decides to instead attack Hannegan City joined by militant Gleps from the Valley. Blacktooth is seized by Texarks, who cast him into a New Rome dungeon while remaining Nomads sack the city.  He escapes the dungeon and falls into a drugged stupor, truly awakening in the damaged St. Peter's Cathedral, where he finds Brownpony and his last surviving bodyguard, Wooshin.  Their reunion is disrupted by the arrival of a Nomad warrior, who informs them that the attack on Hannigan City failed and the last loyal portions of the crusading army are departing. He warns them to flee as a Texark relief force approaches New Rome but Brownpony refuses and seats himself on the papal throne, the first Valana pope in decades to do so.  When the Pope realizes he has caused the church's great defeat, he has Wooshin behead him. Blacktooth stops Wooshin from joining him in the ritual act of suicide, and flees the approaching horsemen. A sick Blacktooth is plagued by visions of Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Women holding his twin children as he searches for Ædrea.

Blacktooth renounces his cardinalship before meeting briefly with the new, Texark-sponsored Pope, who turns out to be none other than the defected Cardinal Nauwhat.  Blacktooth learns that the Hannegan Filpeo Harq, too, is dead, assassinated in an act of self-sacrifice by the vengeful Wooshin.  It is mentioned that Blacktooth lived out his days as a hermit, not far from where Ædrea, now called Sister Clare, lives in a nunnery, home in The Valley of the Misborn."

The novel begins hundreds of years in the future in Manhattan, where most of the buildings have been razed and its population, as with the world's, is largely depleted. The surviving people are illiterate, and are drugged with pills that makes them apathetic and infertile. That has caused human life on the planet to gradually decline to the point of near-extinction. The surviving humans are survived by 
android
 robots, of which Spofforth is the most powerful and sophisticated. No humans have been born in many years and there are no children. Suicide by immolation is rampant, as people have nothing to live for.

Over the years Spofforth has held many important positions, including head of the entire auto industry, which no longer exists, and mayor of St. Louis. He is now the ""dean of faculties"" of 
New York University
,

As the novel begins, Spofforth climbs to the top of the Empire State Building to attempt suicide. The attempt is unsuccessful as Spofforth's programming prohibits suicide. Nevertheless, he has been doing this annually for many years, as he yearns to die.

Spofforth brings a teacher, Paul Bentley, to New York. Bentley has taught himself to read after a 
Rosetta Stone
–like discovery of a film with words matching those in a children's primer.
Spofforth begins to dislike Bentley and the knowledge he has acquired from reading. Bentley says he could teach others to read, but Spofforth says that it is illegal and instead gives him a job of decoding the written titles in ancient silent films.

At the Bronx Zoo, where the animals are robots, Bentley meets Mary Lou. He explains the concept of reading to her, and the two embark on a path toward literacy.  Spofforth responds by sending Bentley to prison for the crime of reading and takes Mary Lou as an unwilling housemate.  Mary Lou is pregnant with Bentley's child. She learns from Spofforth that he has engineered the demise of the human race because he cannot be allowed to die as long as he can serve humans.

Bentley escapes from the prison, spends some time in a Christian community, and makes his way to New York. There he finds Mary Lou and her baby. She tells Paul that Spofforth has agreed to end the drug-induced depopulation. They climb the Empire State Building together and help Spofforth commit suicide."

The novel begins when Janet Evason suddenly arrives and disappears in Jeannine's world. Janet is from Whileaway, a futuristic world where a plague killed all of the men over 800 years ago, and Jeannine lives in a world that never experienced the end of the 
Great Depression
. Janet takes Jeannine to Joanna's world, where both women meet in a cocktail lounge and watch Janet's televised interview. She explains to the male interviewer the culture and customs of Whileawayans which differ greatly from Joanna's world. When Janet begins to explain to the interviewer how women in Whileaway ""copulate"" she is abruptly cut off by a commercial break.

Acting as a guide, Joanna takes Janet to a party in her world to show her how women and men interact with each other. Janet quickly finds herself to be the object of a man's attention as he continually harasses her. After she has had enough, Janet knocks the man down and mocks him. Her behavior shocks everyone at the party, since in Joanna's world, it is believed that women are inferior to men. Janet then expresses her desire to experience living with a typical family to Joanna, who takes Janet to the Wildings’ household in Anytown, U.S.A. Janet meets their teenage daughter Laura Rose who instantly admires Janet's confidence and independence as a woman. Laura realizes that she is attracted to Janet and begins to pursue a sexual relationship with her. This is transgressive for both of them, as Whileaway's taboo against cross-generational relationships (having a relationship with someone old enough to be your parent or young enough to be your child) is as strong as the taboo against same-sex relationships on Laura's world. After the two have sex for the first time, Janet recounts to Laura how she met and fell in love with her wife, Vittoria, back in Whileaway.

Jeannine and Joanna accompany Janet back to Whileaway where they meet Vittoria and stay at their home. A small Whileawayan child follows Joanna and tells her a story about a bear trapped between two worlds as a metaphor for her life. Jeannine returns to her world with Joanna, and they both go to vacation at her brother's house. Jeannine's mother pesters her about her love life and asks whether she is going to get married soon. Jeannine goes on a few dates with some men but still finds herself dissatisfied. Jeannine begins to doubt her sense of reality, but soon decides that she wants to assimilate into her role as a woman. She calls Cal to pick her up and agrees to marry him.

Joanna, Jeannine, and Janet arrive in Jael's world which has had a 40 year old war between men and women. Jael explains that she works for the Bureau of Comparative 
Ethnology
, an organization that concentrates on people's various counterparts in different parallel worlds. She reveals that she is the one who brought all of them together because they are four versions of the same woman. Jael takes all of them with her into enemy territory where she appears to be negotiating a deal with one of the male leaders. At first, the male leader appears to be promoting equality, but Jael quickly realizes that he still believes in the inferiority of women. He relentlessly harasses Jael and tries to convince her that it is necessary for both societies to reconcile. Jael reveals herself as a ruthless assassin, kills the man, and shuttles all of the women back to her house. At her house, the women witness Jael and Davy, her biological automaton, having sex. Jael finally tells the other women why she has assembled all of them. She wants to create secret military bases in the women's worlds without the men's knowledge. Her hope is that eventually, the women in each world will be empowered and overthrow their respective patriarchal societies.

Jeannine and Joanna agree to help Jael assimilate the women soldiers into their worlds, but Janet refuses, given the overall pacifism of Whileaway. Jeannine and Joanna appear to have become stronger individuals and are excited to rise up against their gender roles. Janet is not moved by Jael's intentions so Jael suggests to Janet that the reason for the absence of men on Whileaway is not because of a plague but because the women won the war and killed all of the men in its timeline's past. Janet refuses to believe Jael, and the other women are annoyed at Janet's resistance. The novel ends with the women separating and returning to their worlds, each with a new perspective on her life, her world, and her identity as a woman."

The novel takes place around the planets Yellowstone and Resurgam, in two story lines which converge near the climax of the novel.



Yellowstone
[
edit
]


The novel begins in the year 2605, where 
Skade
 has been tasked with investigating a Conjoiner ship that has returned to the Conjoiner headquarters, the Mother Nest. Skade is a Conjoiner woman who appears to be in touch with secret circles of control within the theoretically 
egalitarian
 Conjoiners society. In the ship, she discovers 
Galiana
, the original founder of the Conjoiners, who left Conjoiner space decades previously on an exploration mission. In space, Galiana had encountered the 
Inhibitors
, who unleashed an agent into her ships, seized control, and killed her crew. It now controls her mind as well. Galiana requests that Skade kill her, but Skade only places her in 
suspended animation
 in the hope that she can be helped in the future.

Ten years later, 
Nevil Clavain
 is facing problems in the Conjoiner mother nest; he is struggling to find answers about what happened to Galiana, whether she is still alive, and about 
Felka
, who he believes may be his and Galiana's daughter. He ponders these concerns during a mission when he ends up rescuing 
Antoinette Bax
 as she flies her freighter through  the top of the atmosphere of the gas giant Tangerine Dream, to fulfill her promise to her late father to bury him there. Clavain warns her that if he ever sees her again, he'll kill her. Her ship severely damaged, Bax limps back to the Rust Belt, a ring of 
orbital habitats
 around Yellowstone, to rejoin her lover, the ship's mechanic.

When Clavain and Skade return to the Mother Nest, Skade, 
Remontoire
, and Felka convince Clavain to join the Conjoiner's leadership, which Clavain had been resisting. Skade informs him about the threat of the Inhibitors and convinces him to undertake a mission to reclaim a cache of lost Conjoiner doomsday weapons. She shows him the fleet of advanced starships that the Conjoiners have been building in secret. 

Although Skade claims that she will use the weapons and ships to defend humanity against the Inhibitors, Clavain is convinced that they will simply evacuate and abandon the rest of humanity. Clavain defects to the Demarchists at Yellowstone and spreads the news of the Inhibitors, and also enlists Antoinette Bax's help to escape the Conjoiners under Skade who are pursuing him.

Clavain is followed by Scorpio and Remontoire, but they along with Antoinette and Clavain are captured by the mysterious underground figure known as 
""H""
. H reveals what happened to Skade during a Conjoiner raid into Chasm City. This was when Skade discovered the secrets that would lead her to develop inertia suppression technology, and when H believes she was subverted by an alien intellect. Clavain reveals Skade's plans for the Conjoiner fleet and the cache weapons, and H agrees to help him beat Skade to them. H supplies ships and his own version of the inertial suppression technology, while Scorpio supplies an army of 
hyper-pigs
 for the pursuit.

Skade and Clavain race to the Resurgam system by employing various strategies, including inertia suppression that pushes their ships to faster relativistic speeds. Eventually, Skade's vessel is damaged in an attempt to  use an advanced technology to exceed the speed of light, and she witnesses the death of a crew member trapped in a collapsing bubble.



Resurgam
[
edit
]


Several years later (roughly 50 from the start of the events in the book), 
Triumvir Ilia Volyova
 and 
Ana Khouri
 are on the planet Resurgam and have discovered a new threat to life: the Inhibitors. Alerted to the presence of humanity during events described in 
Revelation Space
, these swarms of intelligent machines have begun dismantling several rocky moons across the system and are moving their components towards the gas giant, Roc. Volyova and Khouri resolve to evacuate the population of Resurgam, 200,000 people, by posing as government agents to enlist the rebel Thorn in their cause, since he has been attempting to evacuate Resurgam all along. They must also open communications with Captain 
John Brannigan
 who is in direct control of their ship, the 
Nostalgia for Infinity
, since his mind and body have fused with the ship's systems, due to the 
nanotechnological
 Melding Plague. Volyova tries speaking to the Captain to grant her control of the cache weapons as the last resort against the Inhibitors. (These are the same weapons that Clavain is sent to recover for the Conjoiners. During the events in the novel 
Revelation Space
, Volyova activates the weapons, which allows the Conjoiners in Yellowstone to determine their location.) Volyova persuades Captain Brannigan  to let the people evacuate onto the ship, as an ark, that could redeem his past transgressions.

In space, Clavain and Scorpio board Skade's ship to save Felka. Clavain and Scorpio plant explosives as a contingency. After finding Felka but failing to liberate Galiana, they depart and watch Skade's ship explode from a far distance, as Clavain mourns his loss of Galiana.

On Resurgam, Volyova, Khouri, and Thorn begin the lengthy evacuation and preparation of their ship, while the Inhibitors continue their mysterious construction project, suspected to target the system's star. Only a few thousand people are evacuated when the Inhibitors approach Resurgam's star so closely that Volyova scrambles to deploy the cache weapons, in the hope to buy more time. A beta-level simulation of Clavain arrives as data in a laser transmission, and negotiates with Volyova to turn over the cache weapons to him when he arrives on the ship 
Zodiacal Light
. Volyova rejects his persuasive arguments and explains that her need for the weapons is greater than his, so she returns to work on deploying them.

When 
Zodiacal Light
 arrives in the system, and because of the failure of his beta-level to negotiate a handover from Volyova, Clavain attacks 
Nostalgia for Infinity
 and uses Scorpio and his loyal hyper-pigs as a boarding party. Clavain's superior force captures 
Nostalgia for Infinity
, although Volyova is able to damage 
Zodiacal Light
 with one of the cache weapons. The two sides negotiate terms, with Clavain and his crew taking command of Volyova's ship. 

They evacuate the colonists more quickly with the help of Antoinette Bax' freighter, 
Storm Bird
. Clavain finds Volyova dying from injuries she sustained when Captain Brannigan attempted to commit suicide by turning a cache weapon against the ship. Volyova makes a final deal with Clavain to take half of the remaining cache weapons and 
Storm Bird
 to mount a last-ditch attack on the Inhibitors. Bax bids a teary farewell to the mysterious beta-level simulation that has operated 
Storm Bird
 and watched over her, as he says he may find redemption in his last mission with Volyova.

The Inhibitors use their alien technology, built from the matter harvested from the gas giant, Roc, to pierce the layers of Resurgam's star and expose its nuclear fusion core. The radiation energy blasts Resurgam, destroys all its life, and reduces it to a cinder.

Later, Clavain learns Volyova's final attack had no effect. He discovers that Skade narrowly survived their space battle. Clavain reaffirms his goal to return the cache weapons to humanity, since they are their creators and true owners. Skade vows to pursue him and seek vengeance for his defection.

Remontoire and Khouri remain in the system aboard the 
Zodiacal Light
 to contact 
Dan Sylveste
 in the Hades Matrix (seen in the final events of 
Revelation Space
) in the hopes that he may provide knowledge they can use to fight the Inhibitors.

The novel ends as 
Nostalgia for Infinity
 lands vertically in the seawater of on an unnamed Pattern Juggler planet, where the crew and rescued people of Resurgam, all except 40,000, establish a new colony (in the following novel of the series 
Absolution Gap
, the planet is called Ararat). However, the crew is unsure why the Captain/ship chose that planet as a destination. Clavain estimates they'll need about 20 years to wait for the 
Zodiacal Light
 to catch up with them so they can resume the fight against the Inhibitors. 

Felka reveals her true relationship to Clavain and how his lover Galiana visited this planet hundreds of years ago, where she may have uploaded her mind into the Pattern Jugglers in the ocean. Felka believes Galiana somehow planted the location of the planet without revealing it to the Inhibitors. Clavain and Felka walk toward the shore with renewed hope.



Inhibitor Asides
[
edit
]


In addition to the two plot lines there are occasional asides explaining the history and motivation of the Inhibitors. These asides explain the galaxy was once filled with star-faring civilizations. Those civilizations were largely destroyed in the ""Dawn War"", a galaxy-wide conflict over the galaxy's scarce resources. One of these civilizations determines that a collision between our galaxy and another will occur in 3 billion years and create/become the Inhibitors in order to shepherd intelligent life through this cataclysm. They had determined that collision could be most easily dealt with if intelligent life was kept isolated to individual star systems, leaving the Inhibitors to perform any necessary manipulations of stars and planets to reduce the damage caused by the collision.

The asides also reveal that the Inhibitors were not as brutal in their past, but their performance has degraded over the millennia. They have been detecting civilizations at later stages, and required to commit wholesale extinction more often.

Clavain and Felka learn of this history during communication with the Inhibitors in Galiana's head. Clavain, however, is not convinced that the Inhibitors are right about the coming catastrophe and believes that their degrading performance may give humanity a chance for survival that other species have not had. As such, he rejects the Inhibitor requests to stand down.

The 
future collision of our galaxy with the Andromeda Galaxy
 is a scientifically predicted event.
[

]
 However, astronomers believe that it would not cause major damage to the capability of the galaxy to support life because galaxies are so diffuse that very few, if any, planets and stars would collide.

Father Emilio Sandoz is a 
Jesuit
 priest who has returned to Earth and is recovering from his experiences on the planet Rakhat (detailed in 
The Sparrow
). He believes himself to be the only survivor of a disastrous mission to Rakhat that led to a massacre of a village of herbivore Runa people by their carnivorous Jana'ata rulers, which in turn sparked a Runa revolution.

This news caused a rift between the Society of Jesus and the rest of the 
Catholic Church
, and the Jesuits are determined to return to Rakhat and help the Runa. Emilio agrees to teach the members of the second Jesuit expedition to speak the Runa and Jana'ata languages, but refuses to accompany them. He falls in love with a divorced mother named Gina and is released from the priesthood, intending to marry her. Gina's ex-husband Carlo, who is working for the Jesuits and the 
Vatican
, kidnaps Emilio and imprisons him on a spaceship bound for Rakhat.

Sofia Mendes Quinn, a member of the first mission to Rakhat, survived being attacked by the Jana'ata in 
The Sparrow
. She was pregnant at the time, and gives birth to a son, Isaac. Sofia supports the Runa in their revolution and becomes a 
Joan of Arc
 figure for them.

The Jana'ata merchant Supaari, who also appeared in the first novel, fulfills his goal of marrying and beginning a family. However, he soon realizes that he cannot trust his brother-in-law, the Reshtar (third-born prince) Hlavin Kitheri. Supaari flees the city with his baby daughter Ha'anala. They find sanctuary in the Runa village that he had previously traded with, and where he had befriended the first human landing party.

The Runa have been bred for many centuries as not only servants but food for the Jana'ata, and they are willing to sacrifice themselves to feed Suparri and his child. He refuses their offer and instead joins in their revolution, working as a spy against the other Jana'ata. Sofia educates his daughter Ha'anala alongside her own son Isaac, who is 
autistic
. One day, Isaac runs away. Ha'anala follows him, and they find a group of Jana'ata people living in the N'Jarr Valley and stay with them.

When Emilio Sandoz and the Jesuit mission finally arrive on Rakhat, they find that the Runa revolution has succeeded and most of the Jana'ata have been wiped out. Sofia is still searching for her son Isaac, who is now 40. She learns that he is in the N'Jarr Valley and sends Runa troops there, believing that he is a captive. Isaac has actually remained with Ha'anala in the valley by choice, working on a long-term project using his mother's old computer tablet. The Jana'ata and Runa in the valley are trying to build a new culture that will allow both species to live in peace. Yet the Jana'ata of the valley face starvation, as they will not eat their Runa neighbors but face capture by outside Runa troops if they leave the valley to hunt game animals.

The Jesuit Danny Iron Horse, a 
Lakota
, suggests arranging an 
Indian reservation
-like setup for the remaining Jana'ata on Rakhat. Emilio returns to earth accompanied by a Jana'ata poet. Isaac stays in the valley with Ha'anala's children and continues his mysterious project, creating music by overlapping the 
genomes
 of all three sentient species, and finds patterns that he believes are evidence of the existence of God."

 The 
wanderjahr
 is typically a fairly long journey that only ends when the wanderer adopts her adult name (her 
freenom
) and chooses her life's work. Some never complete this rite of passage, and remain Children of Fortune their whole lives. The novel is the story of Wendi Shasta Leonardo's 
wanderjahr
.

The story begins when Wendi (known by her childhood name Moussa) leaves her home planet, Glade, with only a return ticket home, a small amount of spending money, and a sex-enhancing ring. She travels to the planet-sized city of Edoku, where she quickly burns through all her money and becomes a mendicant. She is adopted by a group of Children of Fortune known as the Gypsy Jokers. Moussa falls in love with the leader of the Gypsy Jokers, Pater Pan, who teaches her the art of 
ruespieling
 (story-telling) and gives her the name Sunshine.

After the abrupt disappearance of Pater Pan, Sunshine leaves Edoku with a wealthy Child of Fortune named Guy Vlad Boca. They sample the hedonistic life of the Honored Passengers aboard the interstellar Void Ships and eventually arrive on the planet Belshazaar.

On Belshazzar, there is a large forest known as the Bloomenwald, which is the source of a plethora of naturally occurring psychedelic drugs. The trees use intoxicants to induce mammals to perform 
pollination
 duties, and many Children of Fortune are trapped by the forest ecosystem. Through her force of will, Sunshine is able to lead a group back to reality. This becomes the basis for her first original composition as a 
ruespieler
, ""The Pied Piper of the Bloomenwald"".

Sunshine's tale attracts the attention of an author who convinces her to go find Pater Pan, so that the story will have an ending. Sunshine finds Pater Pan addicted to the Charge, a kind of electronic drug. As he is dying, she experiences his entire life story in a kind of ecstatic vision. Sunshine ends her 
wanderjahr
 and adopts the 
freenom
 Wendi.

Introduction
[
edit
]


The book begins as a ""cozy"" or ""country house"" mystery involving the murder of Sir James Thirkie, a member of the ""Farthing Set"" and the architect of the ""Farthing Peace"" between the United Kingdom and Germany. The Farthing Set, so named for their association with the 
country house
 of that name (and analogous to the real-life 
Cliveden set
)
[
1
]
 prominently supported prewar 
appeasement
, a policy vindicated by the war's outcome. The narrative 
alternates
 between the first-person account of Lucy Kahn, daughter of the proprietors of the Farthing estate, and a third-person narrative that focuses on 
Scotland Yard
 Inspector Peter Carmichael, the lead investigator assigned to the case.



Summary
[
edit
]


At a weekend party at Farthing House, a large country house in 
Hampshire
, Sir James Thirkie, a prominent politician who is considered likely to become a leading minister in an upcoming 
cabinet shuffle
, is found murdered in his room, with a 
yellow Star of David
 pinned to his chest. Though suspicion immediately falls upon David Kahn, the only 
Jew
 invited to the party, the lead investigator, Inspector Peter Carmichael, is unconvinced. Carmichael, who was sent with Sergeant Royston from Scotland Yard to investigate the murder, suspects that the star was placed on the body to divert attention towards David. Equally skeptical is David's wife Lucy, the daughter of estate owner Lord Eversley, who notes the tension between Thirke's newly-pregnant wife, Angela, and Angela's sister, Daphne, who was having an affair with Thirke.

As Carmichael begins his investigation, he requests the assembled guests to remain at the house. Chafing at the oppressive atmosphere, Lucy accepts an offer from her father to 
go riding
, but while they are out, they are attacked by a young man, who shoots at them with a rifle before he is killed by Lord Eversley. An inspection of the body uncovers a membership card identifying him as a 
communist
 and an identity card for an Alan Brown, which is different from the name on the party identity card. Carmichael is puzzled by the incident, which appears to be unconnected to Thirke's murder. As pressure grows for Carmichael to release the guests, a search of the Kahns' apartment turns up letters that offer evidence of David's involvement with an underground Jewish organization, which sought the murder of Thirke and the other members of the ""Farthing Set"". Aware that an arrest would mean the effective conviction of David but still not convinced of his guilt, Carmichael convinces him to remain at Farthing House under police supervision.

Returning to 
London
, Carmichael is given until Friday to conclude the case. His ability to act is further hampered by the political situation since Daphne's husband, Mark Normanby, the 
Foreign Secretary
 and one of the guests in Farthing House, emerges from the cabinet shuffle as 
Prime Minister
. Exploiting both Thirke's murder and the shooting incident, Normanby announces the introduction of identity cards, the expulsion of foreign nationals, the banning of communists and a delay in the 
general election
. Resisting political pressure to arrest David, Carmichael pursues his investigation of Angela and discovers that her baby was likely the result of an affair with the family's 
chauffeur
. Locating Brown's girlfriend, an Agnes Timms, in 
Southend-on-Sea
, Carmichael travels there with Royston to interview the young woman and discovers that Brown was approached by Angela to stage the attack on Lord Eversley, ostensibly as a joke. Returning to London, Carmichael learns that the yellow star was purchased by someone who claimed to be David. With a warrant now issued to arrest David, Carmichael calls to warn the Kahns and so they have time to escape.

With the Kahns now on the run, Carmichael goes to 
Wales
 to interview Thirke's mother, who recounts Angela's admission that she helped Lord Eversley and Mark Normanby murder her husband. While he returns to London to arrest Angela and Normanby, however, Carmichael discovers that Agnes has been murdered. Undaunted, Carmichael presents his findings to Penn-Barkis, the head of Scotland Yard, and identifies the involvement of the three suspects in a conspiracy to murder Thirke and place the blame on the Jews for it. After he listens to Carmichael's description, Penn-Barkis orders Carmichael to drop the case and uses Carmichael's 
homosexuality
 to 
blackmail
 him into acquiescing in the official story.

The book opens in the 1980s, with Lestat coming out of the ground after a long sleep, awakened by the 
rock and roll
 band, Satan's Night Out. He reveals his identity, but the band believes he is joking as, in this world, 
Interview with the Vampire
 is a published novel and they recognize his name from the book. As a response to Louis's recollections, Lestat decides to publish his own autobiography and join the band. He hopes the attention will help him reunite with the vampires he's loved, including Louis. He also craves the excitement of a potential human-vampire conflict as he reveals vampire secrets to the world.

Lestat's autobiography opens with his life as the youngest son of an impoverished noble family in the 18th century 
Auvergne
 countryside. His family is proud but poor and Lestat has few prospects. He longs to join a monastery to learn to read and improve himself, but is denied this education. As a teen, he becomes captivated by traveling actors and flees with a troupe, but his father and brothers catch and beat him. By age 20, Lestat is recognized as a talented hunter and is sent out to kill the wolves harassing their village. The wolves are numerous and his dogs and horse are killed in the fight with Lestat barely surviving. Lestat begins to spiral into an existential depression after this battle. His mother, 
Gabrielle
, encourages him to connect with 
Nicolas de Lenfent
, a tailor's son who has recently returned from Paris. He does so, and he and Nicki connect over their hopes, despairs, and rebellious love for the arts. They run away to Paris, gaining jobs at a theater. Nicki is attempting to become a violinist but feels he began too late to be truly prodigious. Lestat meanwhile shines onstage, going from stage hand to ever greater roles and recognition for his charm.

One of Lestat's admirers in the audience turns out to be a centuries-old vampire, 
Magnus.
 Magnus has been hunting young men with Lestat's build and coloring, looking for an heir to his powers. Magnus kidnaps Lestat from the bed he shares with Nicki and keeps him prisoner. Lestat calls to God for salvation and continually refuses the offer to be turned, but Magnus turns him into a vampire by force. Magnus then kills himself as the centuries have made him mad, but leaves Lestat with a vast fortune. Lestat is both horrified and exhilarated by his newfound abilities. He learns that he is able to mingle with humans, but he knows friends and family would recognize his changed nature. He avoids his loved ones, showering them with gifts as a means to compensate for his absence. At first, he tries to take victims whom he considers at least somewhat malicious, as he feels love for humanity even as he thrills in the intoxication of killing. Lestat struggles with loneliness as he watches Nicki and his theatre troupe from afar. Nicki maintains that Lestat was taken from their room, but the others are skeptical and suspect Lestat married rich. Lestat buys the theater and ensures they are provided for fully. Eventually, he cannot resist checking in on Nicki and the theatre, but he becomes overwhelmed by their scents and the possibility of taking them as victims. Delirious from the horror of his circumstances, Lestat reveals his powers on stage - sending the human audience into a panic. After this, he feels he is irreconcilably inhuman and that his attempts to be moral have been a sham. He begins taking innocent victims. All the while he is haunted by a mysterious supernatural presence that refuses to approach.

Lestat's mother, Gabrielle, dying of 
consumption
, becomes suspicious as his letters no longer seem truly happy. She arrives in Paris to see Lestat for herself before she dies. To save her, Lestat transforms her into a vampire. Gabrielle takes to the freedom of vampirism immediately, shedding the feminine clothes and roles she never longed for to become almost a new being. The pair runs afoul of the Children of Darkness, a coven of devil-worshipping vampires led by 
Armand
, who disapprove of their lifestyle of mingling with humanity and enjoying the pleasures of society. Armand's coven attacks them but finds them challenging to capture. Armand then kidnaps Nicolas to force Lestat and Gabrielle to come to his rescue. Lestat learns that he and Gabrielle go against coven law in many ways, including their strength, as it is forbidden for an ancient vampire like Magnus to pass along his powers. After a heated debate, Lestat turns Armand's coven to chaos by telling them their superstitions about serving Satan and avoiding churches are baseless and have no more evidence than his approach of living well. With the coven conflicted, Lestat escapes with Nicolas, who begs to become a vampire. Nicolas feels abandoned by Lestat and is suspicious that vampirism is a secret of the nobility that Lestat and Gabrielle hid from him. He is insistent that Lestat turn him, which Lestat reluctantly does. In drinking his blood Lestat sees that Nicki is full of emptiness and despair.

Armand seeks Lestat out again, this time joining him at a ball and attempting to seduce him. Once he has Lestat's attentions, he tries to drain him - but Lestat is surprisingly resilient and able to beat Armand. Armand begs to be allowed companionship with Lestat, Gabrielle, and Nicolas - telling him he has insights into the ancient vampires as he was made by a Roman vampire, Marius de Romanus. He also warns Lestat that he will never find true companionship by making other vampires - as a veil exists between the minds of makers and fledglings and fledglings inevitably resent their makers. Lestat refuses Armand, feeling that Armand's need for purpose could not be fulfilled by him - and that Armand's desperation for a doctrine to live by would consume them all. Lestat offers Armand the theater as a new home, as the cemetery where Armand based his coven is set to be demolished. Armand and Nicolas, along with the few vampires Armand allows to live from his prior coven, found the 
Theatre des Vampires
. They begin to write and compose disturbing melodies and plays to perform in front of human audiences. Lestat cannot bear to see the corruption of the theatre he once saw as the embodiment of goodness and he and Nicki fight bitterly. Nicki scorns Lestat's attempts at morality and generosity, considering Lestat ridiculous for attempting to retain morality as a deadly creature of darkness. Nicki commits to the theatre and Lestat decides to travel onwards with Gabrielle.

Still compelled by the idea of Armand's ancient maker, Marius, Lestat leaves messages carved into rock in numerous places while traveling, hoping Marius will see them. Lestat and Gabrielle voyage out of France for several years, though Lestat knows it cannot last as Gabrielle never craved motherhood and wishes to pursue her own ends. Lestat receives updates from the theatre, and learns that Nicki's madness has spiraled beyond the control of the other vampires. They fear he will expose them. Severely depressed, Nicolas eventually commits suicide by throwing himself into a ceremonial bonfire. Lestat mourns Nicki, as well as his human brothers who have died in the French Revolution. Gabrielle tells Lestat she is ready to pursue her own travels, intending to go into deep jungles away from humanity and its norms. Lestat is a creature who loves cities, art, and humanity - and so they part. Lestat promises Gabrielle that he will live and not give up, but he is soon overcome by his losses and descends into the earth to sleep. He thinks about the human lives he is sparing by decaying underground.

Lestat is awoken from his slumber by Marius, who takes him to his Mediterranean home. Marius shares his past with Lestat, and shows him the progenitors of all vampires—Those Who Must Be Kept—
Akasha
 and 
Enkil
. He tells of a catastrophe in which Akasha and Enkil were exposed to the sun. Because they are the root of all vampires, the sunlight hitting them burned and killed all but the oldest vampires of the world. Marius was made by one of these surviving vampires, in order to discover what had caused the calamity. Marius is able to get the story out of Akasha and Enkil's former keeper, and he takes the King and Queen to safeguard them. Following the story, Marius warns Lestat not to disturb Akasha and Enkil but Lestat feels compelled to see them and takes Nicolas's violin down to play. The music awakens them and Akasha feeds from Lestat as Lestat feeds from her. Enkil, furious, attacks and nearly kills Lestat. He is saved by Marius and sent away. Marius explains that he finds purpose in eternity by guarding these old ones, as well as in scholarly pursuits and a commitment to drinking the blood of evildoers. But he says Lestat is not able to stay with him and share these goals now. Marius advises him to live one ""human"" lifetime and make fledglings out of love to be his companions. Marius tells him that he was made too young, and without a strong foundation of a first human lifetime, he will not have the personal strength to endure immortality.

The next section of the book briefly recounts the events of 
Interview with the Vampire
 from Lestat's perspective. He shares his arrival in New Orleans, his love for 
Louis
, and remorse at recklessly turning 
Claudia
 into a child vampire. He also gives conflicting accounts to Louis' statements, saying he generally kept to his goal of drinking from evildoers, but that Louis was too consumed with his own angst to pay much mind to Lestat's motivations. Nevertheless, he feels Claudia was justified in her attempt to kill him, as Lestat's domineering control and secrecy, combined with the selfish crime of committing Claudia to eternity in a helpless, 5 year old form, made their situation untenable. He states that he probably would've done the same in her position. After Claudia's nearly successful attempt to murder him, Lestat reveals that he went to Armand in Paris to beg for powerful blood to heal his wounds. Armand refused and manipulated the weakened Lestat to give testimony against Claudia, who Armand believed should not exist as a child vampire and a burden to Louis. After the trial in which Claudia is destroyed, Armand lies by claiming that he has also destroyed Louis in the ensuing battle. Armand tells Lestat he has not forgiven his prior rejection and destruction of his coven from centuries ago and that Lestat was foolish to expect his help. He pushes Lestat out of a tower to incapacitate him. After recovering somewhat physically, Lestat returns to New Orleans, and gives another conflicting account to the end of 
Interview with the Vampire
, saying he never spoke with Louis in his rotting house, only Armand. He wastes away reading novels and drinking from animals for several years, becoming a wraithlike creature, before going to sleep in the earth.

The book returns to the present, with Lestat and his band successfully launching their rock career. He receives several threats from other vampires but dismisses them and schedules a major concert to take place in San Francisco, On the eve of the concert, Louis tracks Lestat down to the remote home where he's preparing with his band and they share a forgiving and romantic reunion. Louis has read Lestat's autobiography during their time apart, just as Lestat read Louis's 
Interview with the Vampire,
 so they arrive at a greater understanding of one another's history and mindset. Lestat proceeds with the concert, with Louis accompanying him backstage and the two sharing a kiss before the show. However, the concert is attacked by vampires who oppose Lestat's revelations about their nature and history. Louis and Lestat fight through the crowd, but are outnumbered. Mysteriously, the vampires attacking Louis and Lestat begin to burst into flames. Gabrielle drives in as she has been tracking Lestat's recent rise to stardom and the three escape in her car. It is then revealed that Lestat's concert has awakened Akasha, who burned the attacking vampires. The book ends on a cliffhanger, as Lestat feels Akasha arrive to kidnap him for some unknown purpose."

The story is told by the reserved Bartolomeo Aguilera whose cunning and bravery contribute to the outcome of the novel. Born with physical defects, he has integrated 
prosthetic
 material into his body as compensation. Bartolomeo is a close friend and advisor of the Argonos' captain, Nikos.

Within the first few chapters it is clear that Nikos is in an increasingly dangerous situation and that tensions on the ship are beginning to rise. Niko's credibility as captain is declining and many are ready for a new leader. Nikos informs Bartolomeo of news which may help to improve or reduce Nikos' position. While the Bishop's previous failed landing helped to place Nikos in good light, there seems little to improve Nikos' ordeal. A planet suitable for human life has been discovered. It is a short distance away and therefore a landing can be attempted, but more importantly, a signal has been sent from the planet. It is a basic signal offering no information as to who sent it or why. Nikos asks Bartolomeo to join the team which is to land on the planet, which the Bishop names Antioch.

The team consists of representatives of the Executive Council, Bartolomeo included, and of the different 
classes
 on the ship. The crew, along with harvesters which are to collect and process materials for the Argonos, descend on the planet. They soon discover that Antioch appears to have been settled by humans at one time, but it has been deserted for a long time—decades, if not centuries. Although the team visits only a handful of the city-complexes, there are presumably numerous cities around the planet. All of them contain enigmatic and crumbling structures.

The first startling discovery the team makes foreshadows the 
epiphany
 of evil which looms over the Argonos for the latter part of the book. A number of human remains are found outside several of the city-complexes. The remains are all but decayed with only bones remaining, and the few intact 
skeletons
 they find reveal no apparent 
trauma
 or instance of a violent death. However, the second discovery haunts the team even after leaving the planet.

The team enters a glass structure which at first reveals nothing about the world or its former inhabitants. In the structure, they uncover a staircase winding down underground to another chamber. At the bottom of the staircase lies a 
nightmare
: in a vast room there are contained, on hooks and in chains, an unimaginable number of mutilated human skeletons, including a number of children and infants. The Argonos is contacted at once and the team decides it is time to leave.

The Argonos prepares to leave orbit, but amongst the underclasses there is talk of settling on Antioch. Par, a friend of Bartolomeo asks him for his help in a planned 
insurrection
; the common people of the ship's blue-collar ""lower decks"" desire to leave Argonos and live on Antioch in order to escape their lives of unending drudgery on the Argonos. Bartolomeo agrees to help and he obtains access codes for the bay-doors and shuttles. However, the operation is thwarted and fails miserably resulting in several participants, including Bartolomeo, being taken into custody. Bartolomeo soon discovers that Nikos knew about Bartolomeo's involvement and used it to his advantage and reassert himself as captain. Bartolomeo remains in prison for months on end until he is finally released along with all of the other prisoners.

He stands before the Executive Council and defends his reasons for aiding in the operation. Under his advice, other political prisoners are pardoned. Bartolomeo's position as advisor is reinstated and he is updated on a new mystery which Argonos has come across.

Unbeknownst to the planet exploration team, upon their entry into one of the buildings on Antioch, a signal from the building was sent deep into space. The team was never informed of this, but Nikos decided that the Argonos should travel to where the signal had been sent, which ended up being the location of the alien ship. There, this alien starship—a vast, immeasurable, structure far larger than the Argonos—lies dormant in the dead of space, and it appears just as silent and uninhabited as Antioch. Bartolomeo takes head of a team which has been attempting to explore the mysterious ship. There has already been a number of deaths and other unfortunate incidents among previous exploratory team members while exploring the ship. Bartolomeo therefore ensures that extra precautions are taken as he takes control.

Some time after Bartolomeo assumes control of the operations aboard the alien ship, the mystery becomes even greater: a solitary old woman is found in a compartment of the ship which, unlike the rest of the explored sections, inexplicably has Earth-like gravity and air breathable to humans. At first, the old woman is unable to understand the languages used to communicate with her and speaks only in gibberish. She eventually begins to communicate with scientists in English. She says her name is Sarah and claims to have been from Antioch, and says the aliens saved her people, but can clarify nothing else in her delirious state.

Upon Bartolomeo's urging, the Executive Committee decides that rather than continuing to explore the staggeringly huge vessel themselves, they will attach the ship to the Argonos and take it with them in hopes of delivering it to another human settlement with greater resources to continue the ship's exploration. This proves to be a horrible mistake as the true nature of the ship is revealed. Shortly after this decision is made, a young boy known by Bartolomeo sneaks aboard the alien ship, and Bartolomeo uncovers a horrifying part of the puzzle when he goes on board to bring the boy back to the Argonos: behind a door that the exploration team was not able to open on previous visits, Bartolomeo and the boy discover an enormous chamber containing horribly mangled corpses similar to the ones uncovered on Antioch, but in much greater quantity and more well-preserved because they had been frozen. It becomes clear that the aliens who committed the genocidal acts on Antioch were or still are on board the alien vessel, and were most likely its builders. While talking to the distraught boy, Bartolomeo has a sudden realization: How did the old woman know that they had named the planet ""Antioch?"" She is, as deduced by Bartolomeo, an alien.

Bartolomeo calls an emergency meeting with the Executive Council and tells those taking care of ""Sarah"" to seal the room and sedate her. Once the ""Sarah"" realizes something new is happening, her human shape begins to change somewhat and she displays an extreme amount of strength while trying to break out of the medical room. She is eventually sedated and ejected into space, but not before momentarily transforming into something other than human.

Attempts made to separate the alien vessel from the Argonos fail. Weapons have no effect. As panic begins to intensify aboard the ship, a final plan is devised. The residents on the Argonos will be crammed into the harvesters and shuttles, and they will travel back to the abandoned planet Antioch. To rid themselves of the aliens, Nikos and a few other trusted crewmen will remain aboard the ship and conduct a random jump out of the galaxy, possibly out of the universe, thereby taking the alien vessel with them.

The plan is put into action and while the alien vessel struggles to free itself from the Argonos, the two star-ships are soon gone. The story ends with the convoy still on its way to Antioch, although Bartolomeo hopes for the future."

Lew Alton returns to Darkover after a long absence. He muses about the Sharra Rebellion, which events six years earlier, led to his wife's death. In the spaceport, he meets a woman he mistakes for Linnell Aillard, her near duplicate, but she does not recognize him.

Lew arrives at the Comyn Council, with deliberations already in progress. The council is considering accepting the Domain of Aldaran in the Comyn Council, an unpopular move since Aldaran was the seat of the Sharra Rebellion. The council is deeply divided, and Lew sides with the anti-Aldaran faction. Lew reveals that the Sharra Matrix is still active, embedded in the hilt of a sword.

During a riding party, several council members discuss the Sharra Matrix. The riding party is attacked by Robert Kadarin. Lew's brother, Marius, is killed, and the Sharra Matrix stolen. There are strong hints that Dyan Ardais is behind this attack and a series of attacks that follow.

Lew and Callina Aillard meet with the fantastically old keeper, Ashara Alton. She explains the paradox of the 
rhu fead
. Only a comyn may enter the 
rhu fead
, she says, but only a non-comyn may touch the artifacts stored there. Ashara proposes that an individual of Terran lineage, but acclimated to Darkover, might survive the test. Using the powerful matrix screens, Ashara teleports Kathie Marshall into the tower. She is the woman who is a near duplicate of Linnell Aillard. Ashara also reveals to Lew that he has a daughter, Marguerhia, by the sister of his deceased wife.

At the annual Festival Night ball, Lew encounters Dio Ridenow. She tries to warn him that Callina has been taken over telepathically by Ashara. Lew and Regis realize that the Sharra Matrix is present at the ball. Moments later, the ball is attacked by Robert Kadarin and Dyan Ardais. Linnell Aillard is killed, along with two of Dio Ridenow's brothers. Reflecting after these events, Lew realizes that he is in love with Dio.

Lew, Callina and Kathie ride to the 
rhu fead
. As predicted by Ashara, Kathie has absorbed Linnell's Darkovan personality, but as a non-comyn, is able retrieve the Sword of Aldones unharmed. Kadarin, carrying the Sharra sword, appears with Thyra Scott and Dyan Ardais. They demand the Sword of Aldones. Thyra attacks Lew, but they are unsuccessful in their attempt to acquire the Sword.

The survivors of the attack arrive at the spaceport HQ for medical treatment. Kadarin changes sides and claims everything that has happened was Dyan Ardais's idea. He reveals that Ardais has the Sharra Matrix and has kidnapped Marguerhia Alton. The origin of the Sharra Matrix is explained.

In a final conflict, Dyan Ardais, Kadarin, Thyra, Kathie Marshall, and Callina Aillard are killed. Regis Hastur wields the Sword of Aldones to destroy the Sharra Matrix. Dio tells Lew that Ashara Alton is not a living person, but an energy being who has resided in a matrix for centuries, and has the power to inhabit the living. Ashara has killed both Callina and Linnell Aillard in her attempt to possess the Sharra Matrix for herself.

Lew reclaims his daughter,  Marguerhia, from the spaceman's orphanage. He and Dio leave Darkover with no intention of returning. Regis Hastur agrees to cooperate with the Terran Empire."

The protagonist, Matthew Fuller, is a research assistant for physics professor Jonathan Marsh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 2057, when he builds a 
calibrator
 to supply one photon per unit of time. When he presses the reset button, the box unexpectedly disappears for one second. When he presses the button a second time, he finds it disappears for about 10 seconds. The third time, it disappears for a bit less than three minutes. Fuller deduces it is traveling forward in time at intervals approximately 11.8 times the previous interval and he further deduces how to bring other objects, such as himself, along. On the seventh press of the button, Fuller and the box are taken 39 days into the future and unexpectedly land on a busy road. He is arrested on suspicion of murder but is 
bailed
 out of jail by an anonymous person he comes to believe is himself from the future. He continues forward, 465 days, then 15 years, when he is greeted by Professor Marsh who tracked Fuller and calculated the theoretical physics behind time travel (and won a 
Nobel Prize
 for it).

Unsatisfied, Matt travels to 2252 where he learns that the Second Coming of Jesus has occurred and resulted in the One Year War. Society is now governed by a 
theocracy
 led by Jesus and shuns technology. Jesus had anticipated Fuller's appearance at the Massachusetts Institute of Theosophy, where he is appointed to be professor with a female student named Martha assigned to be his assistant. As Fuller tries to scientifically rationalize Jesus's seeming omnipotence, Jesus orders Fuller to destroy the time machine but he instead flees, along with Martha, and lands in the year 4346 outside of 
California
. There they find a society where all of humanity is wealthy and satisfied to a point of apathy. It is here that they encounter an 
artificial intelligence
, named La, that controls 
Los Angeles
. La is curious about her own mortality, and having learned about Matt's time machine from historical records, wishes to join him on a journey to the end of time (
heat death of the universe
) to discover if she can die.

Matt and Martha begin to receive messages in their dreams from beings that appear to Matt as future versions of himself and to Martha as 
Jesus
. He/they warn Matt and Martha of La's willingness to sacrifice their lives in pursuit of her goal, and advises them to stall for time to allow them to catch up. Matt and Martha, accompanied by La in a spacecraft, begin to travel further into the future, discovering evermore unfamiliar species of life, including 
androgynous
 evolutions of humanity and a race of intelligent 
bears
. Time travelers are not always welcome - some future societies having been devastated by diseases brought from the past by such travelers for which future humans had no immunity, and therefore regard them as a dangerous threat.

After a confrontation where they narrowly avoid being killed by La, they meet the people who have been sending them subliminal messages. These beings tell Matt and Martha that the future becomes ever more alien and unpleasant, and offer to send the two back in time, while allowing La to continue jumping forward in time.  The beings can specify either the exact time or the exact location to which Matt and Martha will be sent, but not both (this limitation is similar to the 
uncertainty principle
).  Concerned about the couple possibly materializing in the middle of the ocean or inside of a mountain, they opt to be specific about location and send them to MIT.

When they arrive, they find that it is the late 19th century, and the main MIT campus in 
Cambridge
 has not yet been built.  Having no other option, they live in this society, where Matt studies and teaches physics, aided significantly by his advanced knowledge both of physics and historical events. However, he takes care not to change history – for example, he does not anticipate 
Albert Einstein
 in ""discovering"" the 
theory of relativity
, as he could have easily done; rather, he takes care to appear a talented but not outstanding professor.  Matt and Martha have several children, and the end of the book reveals that Professor Marsh (Matt's MIT professor in the mid-21st century) is actually Matt's descendant.

Introduction
[
edit
]


In 
Count Zero
 Gibson presents ""a high-tech near-future of linked super-computers... [a matrix that] has given rise to ""cyberspace,"" an ""inner"" space something like a three-dimensional video display... [in a] world is dominated by multinational corporations... a few fabulously rich individuals, and the cutthroat competition between them.""
[
1
]
 Seven years after the events of 
Neuromancer
, strange things begin to happen in the Matrix, leading to the proliferation of what appear to be 
voodoo
 
gods
 (hinted to be the fractured remains of the joined AIs that were Neuromancer and Wintermute). Two powerful 
multinational corporations
, Maas Biolabs and Hosaka, are engaged in a battle for control over a powerful new technology, a biochip, using hackers and the Matrix as well as espionage and violence.



Expansive plot summary
[

As with later Gibson works,
[
citation needed
]
 
Count Zero
 has multiple story-lines; in it, a trio of plot lines ultimately converge:
[
1
]


Thread One
:  In the southwestern US, Turner, a corporate 
mercenary soldier
, has been hired by former partner Conroy to help Christopher Mitchell, a brilliant researcher and 
bio-hacker
, make an illegal career move from Maas' corporate fortress built into a 
mesa
 in the Arizona desert to Hosaka, a rival corporation. The attempt is a disaster, and Turner ends up escaping with Angie Mitchell, the scientist's young daughter, instead. Implanted in her brain by her father, she carries the secret plans of the construction of the valuable ""biosoft"" that has made Maas so influential and powerful.  This ""biosoft"" is what multibillionaire Josef Virek (see thread three) ruthlessly pursues so that he can make an evolutionary jump to something resembling 
omniscience
 and 
immortality
. During their flight from both Maas and Hosaka agents, Turner and Angie stay with Rudy, the former's estranged brother, and Sally, his partner and caretaker. Rudy identifies a device implanted in Angie's skull: her father had apparently altered her nervous system to allow her to access the Cyberspace Matrix directly, without a ""deck"" (a computer with an interface directly into the user's brain), but she is not aware of this. During their stay, Turner has a one-night stand with Sally and then leaves with Angie. In the Sprawl he meets with Bobby's group in a shopping mall besieged by agents of Maas and Conroy.

Thread Two
:  In Barrytown, New Jersey a young amateur computer hacker, Bobby Newmark, self-named ""Count Zero"", is given a piece of black market software by some criminal associates ""to test"". When he plugs himself into the matrix and runs the program, it almost kills him. The only thing that saves his life is a sudden image of a girl made of light who interferes and unhooks him from the software just before he flatlines. After fleeing his house (which is immediately thereafter destroyed) he meets Lucas, Beauvoir, and Jackie, a group fascinated by and dedicated to the recent appearance of voodoo deities in Cyberspace, who take him into their protection as they are collectively targeted by various corporate agents. It is eventually revealed that Bobby's mysterious savior is Angie (see Thread One); the two only meet physically at the very end of the book.

Thread Three
:  Marly Krushkova, the former owner of a Paris art gallery whose reputation was destroyed when she was tricked into trying to sell a forgery, is recruited by ultra-rich, reclusive art 
patron
 Josef Virek to find the unknown creator of a series of futuristic collage boxes styled after the work of 
Joseph Cornell
. Unbeknownst to her, the reason behind Virek's interest in these boxes is related to indications of biosoft construction in the design of one, which he suspects may be contained in the others.

These plotlines come together at the end of the story. Virek—the hunter of immortality and unlimited power—becomes the hunted. It is hinted that multiple AIs inhabiting cyberspace are the fragmented, compartmentalized remains of two AIs, Neuromancer and Wintermute (introduced in the first book of Gibson's Sprawl series, 
Neuromancer
), having joined. The AIs were designed by the head of a multi-generational techno-oligarchical family, the Tessier-Ashpools. These AI units now interface with humanity in the form of different Haitian voodoo gods, as they have found these constructs to be the best representations of themselves for communicating.  Hackers worldwide are becoming aware that there is something weird loose in the cyberspace matrix, but most are reluctant to talk about (or deal with) ""voodoo spooks"" supposedly haunting cyberspace.  The ""voodoo gods"" gave Mitchell the information to develop the biosoft, instructing him to insert a biosoft modification in his daughter's brain, and then sent the Cornell boxes into the world to attract and enable the disposal of the malicious Virek.

A pair of epilogue chapters resolve the fates of the protagonists, until 
Mona Lisa Overdrive
. Angie has attained celebrity status as a simstim star, and has entered a relationship with Bobby who is employed as her 'bodyguard'. Marly has returned to Paris and now curates one of the largest art galleries in the city. Turner has returned to his childhood home (the same one occupied by Rudy and Sally earlier in the book) to raise the child conceived during his affair with Sally; Rudy was killed by Conroy's agents when they were trailing Turner and Angie.

The Cyberspace Matrix, a synergistically linked computer network of databases that encompasses all information on Earth, has become home to sentient beings. But most of humanity remains unaware.

Cover of the April 1987 
Ace
 paperback edition with cover art by 
Richard Berry
.


Bobby Newmark
. At the beginning of the novel, Bobby is a small-time ""cowboy"" (
hacker
) who wants to be a big name in cyberspace. He is given what he naïvely trusts is an ""ICE breaker"" (hacking software), unaware that he is in fact being used to test some unknown software to see what it does. He is directed to use the software to infiltrate a 
black ICE
 database which nearly ends up killing him. The acronym ICE is shorthand for ""Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics"". The most formidable of these data defense networks are powerful enough to trace back and kill any hacker making an attempt to defeat them. This is legally sanctioned or is, at least, not illegal. But at the last moment Bobby is rescued, while in Cyberspace and dying, by an image of a girl, Angela Mitchell, who is somehow able to enter cyberspace without using a ""deck"" (computer).

Bobby realizes his target must now know where he lives, so he flees. Shortly after leaving his apartment, he is brutally mugged for his deck and left for dead, only to be rescued and given medical attention by the owners of the software Bobby tried out, a small group who are very interested in what happened to him in Cyberspace. Bobby and Angela (who are roughly the same age) meet at the end of the book. Bobby makes a minor appearance in the third Sprawl novel, 
Mona Lisa Overdrive
.

Turner
. Turner (the only name by which he is known in the novel) is a 
mercenary
 who is employed by various 
corporations
 to help vital employees of competing corporations ""defect"" to Turner's employers.  The novel begins with an account of a job in 
New Delhi
 in which Turner was nearly killed by a Slamhound, a type of mobile 
bomb
.  After three months of reconstructive 
surgery
 in 
Singapore
, Turner takes a vacation in 
Mexico
, where he meets and becomes sexually involved with a woman named Allison.  While on the beach with Allison, Turner sees a familiar yacht close to shore and a powerboat from the yacht approaching the beach, bearing the logo of the Hosaka Corporation.  Turner tells Allison to leave while he waits for the raft's passenger to come ashore.  He already knows that the passenger is Conroy, another mercenary with whom Turner has worked in the past.  Conroy recruits Turner for another ""extraction"" job; this time, Conroy and Turner are to help a man named Christopher Mitchell leave Maas Biolabs for Hosaka.  Mitchell carries with him the expertise to design and manufacture ""biochips"", a technology superior to the nearly ubiquitous silicon 
microprocessors
 of the era.  Maas Biolabs holds the patents and secrets to biochip technology and will use every means it can to prevent Mitchell's escape.  Conroy also reveals that Allison is a ""field 
psychologist
"" working for Hosaka to monitor Turner and help his recovery.

Turner is a disciplined professional, but is troubled by memories of past jobs that ended tragically as well as his relationship with his gifted brother Rudy (who is a reclusive 
alcoholic
 and 
drug
 addict).  Turner comes to realize that the unsuccessful attempt to ""bring over"" Christopher Mitchell from Maas to Hosaka resulted from a betrayal and suspects that Conroy is behind it.  He also recognizes that Angie Mitchell was sent out from the Maas facility by her father, and that she is in grave danger. He resolves to protect her while finding out who is pursuing her and why.

Marly Krushkhova
. Marly, prior to the beginning of the story, operated a small art gallery in Paris.  She became notorious as a result of the disgrace from attempting to sell a forged box 
assemblage
 that was supposedly a lost piece by the American sculptor 
Joseph Cornell
. She was unaware that the piece was a fake, having been duped by her then-lover Alain, the gallery's co-owner, who had embezzled money from the gallery to finance the forgery. Unemployed and living with her friend Andrea, Marly receives a job offer from the immensely wealthy businessman Josef Virek.  During her interview, conducted via a very advanced 
simstim
 link, Virek informs Marly that he has collected several remarkable box assemblages similar to those created by Cornell.  Virek then hires Marly to find out who is producing the pieces, offering her unlimited financial support during the course of her search.

Although Marly welcomes the opportunity to get out of her current situation, she does not fully trust the mysterious and secretive Virek.  This mistrust only deepens when it becomes clear that she is being followed and monitored by Virek's agents, in particular Virek's right-hand man, Paco.  Marly tries to stay a step ahead of Virek and Paco while discovering the identity of the boxes' creator.

Steel Beach
 takes place in Varley’s ""
Eight Worlds
"" universe. The 
Solar System
 has been colonized by human refugees fleeing aliens (known as ""the Invaders""). Earth and 
Jupiter
 are off-limits to humanity, but Earth's 
Moon
 and the other planets and moons of the Solar System have all become populated. There are also minor colonies set in the 
Oort cloud
 beyond the Solar System itself. 

The ""steel beach"" of the title is Earth's Moon, the most heavily inhabited world in the Solar System since the Invaders obliterated human civilization on Earth. The title alludes to humans being figuratively thrown onto the inhospitable Moon, a parallel to fish making their way onto land in the evolution of

The book's protagonist, Hildy Johnson, is a newspaper reporter, named after the male protagonist of the 
1928 play
 and 1931 film 
The Front Page
 and the female protagonist of the 1940 film 
His Girl Friday
 (Hildy changes gender halfway through the book), who finds trouble beneath the surface of the near-utopian society run by the Central Computer. The Central Computer runs every aspect of every person's life: it is the government, court, information source, and friend to every citizen.

At the beginning of the novel, Hildy has become dissatisfied with life, much like many others on the moon who take part, for example, in destructive activities such as ""slash boxing""—a blend of knife fighting and boxing, on which Hildy reports. It is revealed that Hildy has made multiple suicide attempts. Scenes such as a discussion of suicide with a slain slash boxer suggest that Hildy is an unreliable narrator.

The first half of the story deals with behaviors in the future society such as indoctrinations of celebrity heads-in-jars, negotiating with brontosaurus herds to figure out whom they will sacrifice to make burger patties, and Earth-themed ""Disneylands"" which come complete with snakes, sand and sunburns. The protagonist grew up on a brontosaur ranch run by a no-nonsense rancher with little time for philosophical speculation, and finds solace in the quasi-dedication of the Texas Disneyland's inhabitants to authenticity. 

In the second half, Hildy contacts a group of people who have figured out how to exist on the surface without spacesuits. These people reveal that they are hiding from the Central Computer, both to keep their technology secret, and to stay free of secret experiments the Central Computer has been performing on people.

A man named ""Aristide"" adventures in the world of Midgarth, which was created as a medieval fantasy world. 
Genetic engineering
 it has populated it with ""fantasy"" races and its physical laws do not allow for the creation of 
firearms
. Aristide is the alias Pablo Monagas Perez, one of the most important figures in human society. Over a thousand years ago Perez had been part of the team which created artificial intelligence, thus launching humanity along its path to paradise.

Accompanied by his cat Bitsy, who is really an avatar of the supercomputer Endora, he is now dedicated to studying the ""implied spaces"" of the human constructed pocket universes: the places which were created as the byproduct of desired features. While working in Midgarth, Aristide learns of a series of particularly successful bandits preying on a local trade route. They are apparently led by a band of mysterious priests and kidnap their victims, who are never seen again.

Aristide and a group of travelers confront these bandits. During the confrontation, Aristide discovers that the priests who lead the bandits are able to create wormholes which transport their opponents to an unknown location. Worried by the advanced technology that these priests have, he takes some of their remains to his friend and former lover Daljit to be analyzed. When it is determined that the priests were in fact ""pod people"", illegal artificial lifeforms, they become worried that someone is engaged in a plot to bring down civilization.

Aristide and Daljit conclude that the priests were abducting people in order to reprogram then to serve the priests' unknown masters. Checking records they discover that there has been a rash of unsolved disappearances in the archipelago universe Hawaiki. Aristide travels there where he encounters agents of the conspiracy and narrowly misses being kidnapped, although he loses Bitsy in the process. Returning to his home universe Topaz he informs the authorities, including his friend the Prime Minister, who begin an investigation. They determine that whoever is behind this must have corrupted one of the supercomputers, a terrifying prospect to people whose entire civilization is built around those machines.

It is eventually discovered that the rogue AI is Cortland, a surprising choice given that Cortland is one of the most eccentric AIs whose interests run mostly towards ontology. Before they can act on this information their opponent reveals himself. He calls himself Vindex and closes down access to the universes based on Cortland. At the same time he launches a viral zombie plague at Topaz. Aristide is forced to kill Daljit when she becomes infected with the virus and attacks him but she is soon resurrected and along with some others who perished in the plague dedicates herself to the war effort.

Aristide also dedicates himself to the war effort, volunteering to lead part of the coordinated assault against Cortland. Before the assault happens, however, he realizes that Vindex has sabotaged the resurrection machinery. All the people killed in the zombie plague have been resurrected as loyal followers of Vindex, a kind of fifth column. Before he can report his discovery he is killed by Daljit and resurrected as a loyal follower of Vindex himself. However, before he can betray Topaz the problem is discovered by the authorities who incapacitate the victims and reverse Vindex's conditioning.

Aristide goes on to lead an assault on Cortland and watches as all his men are killed. He alone survives and is brought face to face with Vindex. There, the villain reveals his identity. He is in fact Pablo Monagas Perez. His personality had been calved off centuries before to lead the human expedition to Epsilon Eridani. He relates to Aristide the story of how he and a version of Daljit had gone with millions of others to colonize Epsilon Eridani, creating a new world and a supercomputer orbiting the sun.

Along this trip, Pablo and Daljit had fallen deeply in love and Daljit had become more and more interested in exploring the origins of the universe. In doing so she discovered that our universe is, in fact, an artificial construct, just like the pocket universes that humanity created but on a much larger scale. However, before she can fully explore the implications of this shocking discovery Epsilon Eridani undergoes a stellar expansion which is labeled by those in the Sol system as ""The Big Belch"". This expansion destroys the Epsilon Eridani's orbital supercomputer and fries the day side of the artificially constructed world orbiting it.

Hundreds of millions die in the conflagration. Only those on the night side of the planet, such as Pablo, are able to survive and only by hiding in deep bunkers. Most of the survivors opt to head back to Sol, life around Epsilon Eridani no longer being possible, but their ship mysteriously vanishes along the way. Pablo remains to search for Daljit, who he hopes survived. She did not but he becomes obsessed with her work and with the idea of punishing the creators of this universe, whom he calls The Inept, for all the suffering of humanity. Returning to the Sol system, he contacts Cortland, whose interest in ontology allows Pablo to convince the computer to aid him. Pablo explains that he is not attempting to destroy human civilization, but rather to take it over so that everyone will work towards his goal: using a wormhole to travel back to the origins of the universe and punish its creators.

Aristide derides Pablo's plan as madness and is able to escape with the help of Bitsy, who has been living with Pablo since she disappeared. Aristide returns to Topaz where he informs the leadership of Vindex's plans. Before they can pursue any other action the supercomputer Aloysius is destroyed by a 
mass driver
 which Vindex had created in the 
kuiper belt
.

As the other supercomputers adjust their orbits in order to stay out of the line of fire, the authorities desperately attempt to come up with a plan to defeat Vindex. One person comes up with the idea of creating their own mass drivers within pocket universes. These would have the advantage of being undetectable to Vindex until they were actually fired.

Aristide then comes up with the idea of creating a massive pocket universe, dubbed an ""overpocket"" which will encompass the inner solar system, thus cutting Vindex off from his mass driver in the kuiper belt. With the overpocket deployed, the other supercomputers unleash their own mass drivers against Vindex and Cortland, destroying them. The book concludes with Aristide concluding that Vindex's idea of using a wormhole to travel to the beginning of time is a worthy one and that he might attempt to do it with willing allies."

Soon after this, Mingolla is recruited into the Psicorps, an elite group of psychics the United States has assembled to counter the 
Soviet Union
's own.  Debora, a veteran of the revolt that led to American intervention in the first place, is designated his target.  On his way through Psicorps training to refine his mental abilities, Mingolla learns that this front of the ongoing 
Cold War
, as well as the war itself, is a manipulation by two 
Panamanian
 
families
, the Madradonas and the Sotomayors, over three centuries to increase psychic potential in humanity as well as their own genetic diversity.

Mingolla and Debora meet and part several times before their meeting with the Madradonas and Sotomayors in 
Darién, Panama
 and become embroiled with the members of Mingolla's former 
squad
 in a firefight which culminates in the nuclear destruction of 
Panama City
.  David and Debora leave the city and their former friends and antagonists behind them, deciding that ultimately what matters is their love for one another, the only item that has not been blatantly manipulated.

The 
fictional work

The story is told from a first person perspective of the narrator recounting a tale from an old friend of his, Tom Flanagan, whom he runs into years after the events of the story, in a nightclub.

Years ago, Tom and another boy named Del Nightingale attend the prestigious all boys private school Carson. The freshmen run afoul of senior Steve “Skeleton” Ridpath, an antisocial psychopath. Steve and Tom both have vivid nightmares of a strange figure watching them and of a vulture hovering over them, which seem to oddly connect to Del’s childhood. Del expresses his love of magic to Tom, getting him hooked on as well, showing an expertise in the craft.

At an away football game, Skeleton steals an expensive artifact from the other school, leading to the Carson students to be subjected to extensive and intense interrogation by the principal. It’s revealed that Skeleton kept the item, alongside several papers, inside the piano bench, explaining his anger towards anyone who got near it. Del discovers the artifact and destroys it, but doesn’t reveal Skeleton stole it to the staff, and the situation is mostly forgotten.

Del and Tom perform a magic show for the school. At the end of their act, the auditorium catches fire, killing one student. The freshmen wonder where Skeleton was during the fire, and grieve the death of the student, fellow freshmen Dave Brick. In the summer, Tom discovers his father has died from cancer, and is invited to stay with Del at his uncles estate, Shadowland, for the summer. Feeling a need to protect Del, Tom agrees to go. On the train ride to Vermont, Del explains that his uncle was a renowned magician who taught Del real magic and wants to teach Tom as well. Del also reveals that he controlled Skeleton to steal the artifact, hoping it would suspend Skeleton but the plan evidently did not work. Tom  stumbles on a train compartment that did not exist before, and runs into Skeleton who disappears shortly thereafter. The train is delayed by a crash, but Tom and Del make it safely, albeit hours late.

Arriving in Vermont, Tom meets Del’s uncle, Coleman Collins, an evident alcoholic. Collins introduces Tom to Shadowland, and prepares them for the summer. As Collins performs trickery on the boys, warping their sense of time and space, he recounts his past as a 
World War I
 soldier and nurse and how he acquired his magical persona. Tom seems to run into Collins randomly around Shadowland, who disturbs Tom with cryptic messages about Tom’s future as the “King of the Cats.” Del becomes jealous of Tom as Del is isolated from everyone, but the two reconcile as Tom schemes to make Del the future ruler of Shadowland, not wanting the position to be handed to him.

Also in Shadowland are the Wandering Boys, a group of burly men who acted as Collins’ bodyguards during the War, and Rose Armstrong, a mysterious fifteen year old who stays on the lake. Rose confides to Tom that Collins is manipulating the boys against each other and she wishes to escape to rescue the two of them. The two begin to fall in love with each other, meeting up at night to discuss ways to escape and express their love. Over time Tom is able to convince Del that Collins is psychopathic.

Collins finishes the tale of his past to Tom and Del. As a medic, Collins was forced to mercy kill a fellow soldier who was grievously injured. Believing he had become the man he murdered, Collins suffered from multiple personality disorder, and ran away from the war to perform in magic shows around Europe. While traveling he was invited by Speckle John, another magician, to join his group, and began dating Rosa Forte, and hired the Wandering Boys, becoming a massively successful group. Collins also mastered an entity known as the Collector, a receptacle that Collins used to murder any competitors after possessing them. After catching Speckle John making love to Rosa Forte, Collins left the group after taking away Speckle John’s powers. Tom realizes Collins is grooming him to become Collins successor.

Rose guides Tom and Del to an underground tunnel system that leads them out of Shadowland. While walking, they are spotted and chased by the Wandering Boys. Rose tricks the boys by taking them back to Collins manor. Collins decides to start his final performance early, crucifying Tom in the main stage and letting the Wandering Boys mercilessly beat Del. Tom awakens and meets the spirit of Speckle John, who was reincarnated as Del’s butler, who mentally pushes Tom to escape. Tom shoots and kills some of the Wandering Boys, and rescues Del from the rest of them. They are joined by Rose, a reincarnation of Rosa Forte, who admits that Collins manipulated her as well as she believed leading them back would save them. The three prepare to face off against Collins.

The Collector, possessing Skeleton, arrives and pursues the trio. Del is kidnapped by Collins, Rose runs away and hides and Tom is momentarily killed by the Collector. Tom is able to rip Skeleton from the Collector and lets him walk away alive. Tom and Rose barge into Collins room. He expresses disappointment in Tom, deeming him a failure, and turns Del into a bird before disappearing. Tom follows Collins around the manor before he kills Del by turning him into stone. The two fight, with Tom trapping Collins inside the Collector and sending him away. Tom burns the house down and leaves with Rose, where they sleep on the lakeshore before she disappears in the morning, inferring that Rose is a mermaid. Tom sets the statue of Del on the lake before leaving Shadowland.

In the present, after interviewing others that Tom Flanagan knew, the narrator meets an older Skeleton at a monastery who seems to have no recollection of the events of the story. The narrator visits the town where Shadowland resides in and visits to find nothing, but stumbles on a brick, realizing that the estate has fully burned down, confirming Tom’s story."

Part One: Conflicting Oaths
[
edit
]


Magda Lorne tenders her resignation from Terran service to her supervisor, Cholayna Ares, saying that she has taken an oath to spend six months in the Guildhouse of the Renuniciates at Thendera. Cholayna tries to talk her out of resigning, and Magda agrees to detached duty.

Jaelle n'ha Melora starts her first day of working in the spaceport, but finds conforming to Terran customs a challenge. She quickly discovers that her new husband, Peter Haldane, despite being raised on Darkover, has typically Terran sexist attitudes towards women. Jaelle is asked by the legate, Russell Montray, if she can help one of his agents pass as a native.

Magda meets with Mother Lauria at the guildhouse and learns the rules under which she will be living for the next six months. An injured woman named Keitha knocks at the door and asks to take the oath, which will grant her refuge from her husband and family. Several days later, Magda, Doria and Keitha undergo a consciousness-raising session with her future sisters regarding her motives for joining the Renunciates. She experiences a vision of the Goddess Avarra.

Jaelle meets with Kadarin, a Terran operative, to assist him in prepping for a trip to the Dry Towns. She is assigned to give Alessandro Li a lesson in Darkover's history, but comes to distrust his motives, telling her husband that he wants to reduce Darkover to a Terran colony. Peter, ever ambitious, ignores her. Jaelle realizes that Peter does not consider her an equal partner in the marriage, and that, in many respects, she has broken her Renunciate oath by marrying him.

In the Guildhouse, Bryna gives birth to a boy; since no male may stay in the guildhouse, he is adopted out to a male relative. Camilla tells Magda the story of how she came to be a Renunciate. Keitha's abusive husband arrives with two mercenaries, demanding the return of his wife. When the Renunciates refuse, a fight ensues. Magda kills one of the mercenaries and comes close to killing the second before Camilla stops her; Magda's failure to follow Darkovan codes of conduct have indebted the Guildhouse to pay steep damages for her mistakes. Magda continues to struggle with the expectations of her Renunciate sisters.



Part Two: Sundering
[
edit

Cholayna asks Jaelle to intercede with the Guildhouse to allow some of the Reuniciates to work in the spaceport. After a private meeting with Mother Lauria, Jaelle joins the house meeting, which is a combination disciplinary hearing and consciousness-raising session. Afterwards, Jaelle mentions one guild member who is away on Sisterhood business, explaining that this organization is a remnant of one of the original groups that founded the Renunciates.

A diplomatic function is arranged between Danvan Hastur and a group of Terran officials. Russell Montray and Alessandro Li manage to offend their Darkovan hosts over the issue of airspace and local control. Lorill Hastur and Rohana Ardais arrive, and Rohana asks to speak privately with Jaelle. Rohana notes that Jaelle is pregnant with a daughter, and that this daughter will be the heir to the Aillard domain, which passes through female hands. She explains that Jaelle has no choice; it is the law of the Comyn.

A fire breaks out on Alton lands. A number of Renunciates volunteer to help fight the fire, including Magda. They meet Damon Ridenow, Regent of Alton, and Andrew Carr, a Terran married to Ridenow's sister-in-law (from 
The Forbidden Tower
). Carr recognizes Magda as an Intelligence operative, but does not give her away. Magda realizes that Ridenow and Carr treat those around them as equals, unlike the other Comyn nobility she has met. Eventually her burns are healed by Hilary Castamir-Sytris (from 
Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover
).



Part Three: Outgrowth

Russell Montray and Alessandro Li become obsessed with meeting Andrew Carr, now called An’ndra Lanart. Despite Magda, Peter and others explaining the breach of etiquette this could cause, they are insistent. Magda realizes that Carr must be warned. As Carr is leaving, Montray makes a scene, betraying his incompetence. Magda resigns, in part because she realizes her skills will never be fully valued because she is female.

Jaelle tells Peter that their marriage was a mistake, that she wants to divorce. When he cannot persuade her to change her mind, he hurls insults at her. Their discussion is interrupted by a loudspeaker page. Lady Rohana has come to the Terran zone to confront Jaelle about her duties to the Aillard Domain.

As she decides to leave the Terran zone entirely, Jaelle learns that Alessandro Li has undertaken a journey to the Kilghard Hills without an escort. She determines to follow him, but Peter threatens to have the Terran authorities lock her up on the grounds that she is pregnant. Frightened, she throws him to the floor, and leaves believing that she has killed him.

Jaelle rides into the Kilghard Hills after Li. In the storm, kireseth pollen is disturbed, giving Jaelle a vision of her daughter, Cleindori, in red Keeper's robes. She hears Magda's voice encouraging her, but believes her to be another vision. Eventually the two women find shelter in a cave, and Jaelle realizes that Magda has come after her, because of her own premonition of Jaelle's death.

Jaelle and Magda ponder their failures – as married women, as Renunciates. Jaelle realizes that she doesn't really want Peter's baby. Several days later, she miscarries.

Magda hallucinates a mystical conversation that she does not fully understand. Later she perceives telepathic contact with Andrew Carr. Shortly thereafter, they are rescued.

Alessandro Li is also rescued and persuaded to advocate for the removal of Russell Montray, in favor of a competent legate. He agrees to make no trouble for Carr. Inquires are made about Peter Haldane; Jaelle did not kill him. Li agrees to arrange her divorce.

Magda has another hallucination of mystical voices, who identify themselves as the Dark Sisterhood, working for the long-term survival of Darkover. She also foresees that Jaelle will become pregnant by Damon Ridenow and give birth to Cleindori Aillard."

Francis Sandow is the last surviving human born in the 20th century. An early space colonist, he spent long centuries of space travel in suspended animation. After his last such trip, he woke in the 27th century, where everything had changed.  Desperate for something to hold to, he sought out a mentor, who happened to be a member of a very long-lived and slowly dying alien race, the Pei'ans.  Under this tutelage, Sandow eventually became a telepath and ""worldscaper"". Worldscapers have the ability to create and/or 
terraform
 planets. The process of becoming a worldscaper culminates in a mystic rite called ""Naming"" that binds the mortal to one of the gods in the Pei'an pantheon, and it is believed that the worldscaper is actually acting as an avatar for the god. There are only twenty-seven existing worldscapers; Sandow, bound to Shimbo of Darktree, Shrugger of Thunders, is the only non-Pei'an among them. Outworlders are welcome to practice the religion, which is called Strantri. Sandow opines it will be the first major religion to outlive its founders. Unlike most of the Pei'an deities, who tend to be chimeras like Egyptian gods, Shimbo is also unmistakably human, showing that the Pei'ans had visited Earth in the distant past.

The rite of Naming was once reserved for the high priests of the Pei'an religion. Sandow is a confirmed agnostic as far as the objective existence of the gods is concerned.  However, whenever he sits for a time in a Strantri shrine, the icon of Shimbo always lights up, and this happens simultaneously in every shrine in the galaxy.

At the beginning of the novel, Sandow is one of the most famous men in the Galaxy, wealthy beyond imagination, living a life of seclusion and luxury in worlds he fashions according to his taste.  But he is lured into action by a series of photographs sent to him anonymously, showing him old enemies, old friends, and old lovers—most of whom should be dead, but appearing in the photographs to be alive.

The novel is partly a tribute to 
Ernest Hemingway
 and some of its meditative sequences are written in a Hemingway-like style.  Through Sandow's narrative, Zelazny presents observations on 20th-century American culture and how it has changed as other planets are created or discovered. An episode in a luxurious city of an earth colony leads to a rant on 
gratuities
, for example.

Eventually Sandow makes his way to Illyria, a world he created as an idyllic paradise, but finds it has been severely damaged. The enemy is a Pei'an rival who as an orthodox member of the faith feels that Sandow's Naming was sacrilege. The ultimate conflict takes place on the Isle of the Dead, at the center of a great lake. It is a replica of 
Arnold Böcklin
's famous 
Isle of the Dead
 painting.

Sandow also appears as a character in 
To Die in Italbar
 (1973) and the short story ""Dismal Light"" in the collection

Embassytown
 takes place mostly in the city of the title, on the planet Arieka. Embassytown is a colony of a state called Bremen; and its trade goods (precious metal and alien-influenced biotech), along with Embassytown's unique position at the edge of the known universe, make it a notable colony.

Avice Benner Cho, an ""Immerser"" (a traveller on the Immer, see 
§ Style
 below for the meaning of Miéville's neologisms), has returned to her childhood home from her adventures in the ""
Out
"". On the planet of Arieka humans and other ""exots"" co-exist with the indigenous, enigmatic Ariekei—otherwise known as the Hosts. Few people can speak the language of the Ariekei (referred to only as ""Language""), as it requires the orator to speak two words at once with one mind; those humans who can are genetically engineered twins known as Ambassadors, bred solely for this purpose. The Ambassadors can be understood by the Ariekei (who do not recognise any other form of communication) allowing for trade in their valuable biotechnology. Language does not allow for lying or even speculation, Language reflects both their state of mind and reality as the Ariekei perceive it; they create literal 
similes
 by recruiting individuals to perform activities that can then become allusions in Language.  Avice herself became a simile when younger, ""the girl who was hurt in the dark and ate what was given to her"". Ariekei compete at Festivals of Lies to see who can most closely approximate speaking an untruth, an act both thrilling and highly taboo.

The relationship between humans and Ariekei has proceeded in relative tranquillity for many years. However a new Ambassador arrives, named 
⁠
Ez
/
Ra
⁠
, who despite not being twins, is able to speak Language. The speech of the new Bremen-engineered Ambassador, regardless of words spoken, intoxicates any Ariekei exposed to it, and they become addicted to the extent that they cannot live without it.

A faction of the Ariekei deafen themselves to break their addiction and begin to violently convert others, developing increasingly sophisticated gesture-based communication. Avice is drawn into a search for a solution, having a special relationship with the Ariekei as a human simile. With assistance from sympathetic Ambassadors, she trains a small group of Hosts to be able to use metaphors and eventually utter lies. Due to the interconnectedness of thought and Language, this has the effect of altering their minds and now the words of 
⁠
Ez
/
Ra
⁠
 lose their addictive properties. The two Ariekei factions reconcile; freed from the literal nature of Language, they are able to learn new forms of communication, which also allows them to speak to non-Ambassador humans."

They find Calvin living as a companion inside a

Gaea
, lives in the hub of the torus 600 km above them. Cirocco, Gaby, and Gene decide to climb up to this place using the support cables that maintain the structure against centrifugal force. During the journey, Gene's behavior becomes increasingly erratic. He rapes and assaults Gaby and leaves her for dead, and then rapes Cirocco. However, Gaby is not dead and rescues Cirocco, cutting off Gene's ear with a hatchet and destroying his face. The two women continue climbing for months. High in one of the spokes of the great wheel they find April, who has been transformed into an angel. She, like the other Angels, is solitary by nature, and can hardly bear to be near them.

Finally reaching the hub, they discover Gaea, who presents herself as a frumpy middle-aged woman. She explains that the great wheel is very old. Some of the regional intelligences around the rim have rebelled against the center, and it was one of these regional intelligences that captured the 
Ringmaster
 and altered its crew, not Gaea herself. Gaea rescued them and, unable to change them back, placed them where they would be happy.

Gaea has been watching television signals from Earth and is obsessed by movies, especially from Hollywood's Golden Age. Having seen war movies, and deciding that humanity will inevitably declare war on her, the Titanide-Angel war was a way for her to practice.

Gaea offers to give Cirocco a long life and unusual abilities in exchange for being Gaea's agent at the Rim, her 
Wizard
. Cirocco accepts, with the condition that the war between the Titanides and Angels must stop."

In 2021, 
radio astronomy
 on the 
Moon
 reveals the presence of life by a nearby 
red dwarf
, on a tide-locked planet.
[
a
]
 To investigate, Earth's governments convert a space colony into 
Lancer
, a 
Bussard ramjet
-powered interstellar ship based on the design of a crashed alien ship discovered in the 
Mare Marginis
.

In 2061, the 
Lancer
 arrives and discovers a primitive race of nomads, broadcasting using organs adapted to emit and receive 
electromagnetic radiation
 (hence ""EM""s). A curious satellite is discovered in orbit, at least a million years old, roughly when a meteor shower destroyed the EMs' civilization.

On Earth, international commerce is brought to a standstill when mysterious spaceships drop sea creatures dubbed 
Swarmers
 and 
Skimmers
 (for their behaviour: Swarmers swarm ships and head-butt them until they sink, and Skimmers simply jump and skim around like dolphins). They begin multiplying and the Swarmers begin attacking humans and all their works on the seas.

The expedition's first contacts go poorly: The attempt to enter one of the two satellites prompts a massive retaliation that kills most of the crew. Meanwhile, their attempt to contact the EMs in person confuses them; the aliens had expected a reply directly from Earth. The EMs' attempt to communicate with the messenger via radar accidentally cooks him alive. The standby team misinterprets the accident as a deliberate attack and massacres the EMs.

Nigel works with mathematicians and other experts to interpret the EMs' transmission. His analysis reveals that their technologically advanced civilization had attracted the attention of machines, who attacked with orbital bombardments that levelled the EMs' cities and cracked open the crust of the planet, permanently altering the ecosphere. The EMs used 
genetic engineering
 to adapt their bodies to use silicon and transistors for a nervous system. As the satellite is programmed to react only to high technology, not inbuilt features of organisms, the EMs are able to broadcast their message to other biological races unmolested.

No sooner has two-way communication been established than new orders come from Earth to move on to 
Ross 128
, where they think the Skimmers and Swarmers may have originated.  En route, the crew analyze reports from space probes. Walmsley hypothesizes that a machine-based race is systematically destroying or guarding planets supporting organic life, and is responsible for the anomalies; the Swarmers represent a first strike at Earth, which had eluded the machines' attempts to kill it, since the assigned Watcher (as Nigel calls the satellites) was destroyed by the Mare Marginis wreck. His ideas are regarded as being too speculative; the consensus is that Watchers are simply a form of weaponry left over from the suicide of biological races, and the Swarmer invasion is a grab for a new world.

At Ross 128, a 
Ganymede
-like moon is found with a Watcher in orbit. Initially it is taken as a disproof of Walmsley's idea that Watchers will appear around any depopulated world that had once harboured technologically advanced biological life. The 
de facto
 leader Ted, who has always disliked Walmsley, attempts to covertly force Walmsley into 
hibernation
 until they return to Earth. Walmsley breaks out part-way through the medical preparations and escapes to the moon. There he discovers a much-reduced sapient civilization that had links to the EMs before the Watcher came. The Watcher prevented the moon's inhabitants from reaching the surface and developing technology, but cannot destroy the civilization as it is protected by ten kilometres of ice.

News comes from Earth (delayed nine years by the speed of light) that the Swarmers have begun land invasions; the tense superpowers each suspect the other, and escalate into a full-scale nuclear war. The machines, who had attempted to engineer just such a conflict, send their flotilla against the weakened Earth. The grim news galvanizes the crew to reactivate the fusion drive and turn the plume on the Watcher. This tactic cripples the Watcher, but its retaliation damages the 
Lancer
’s drive system.



New ending

At some point after the publication of one or more sequels (beginning with 
Great Sky River
, for the American paperback edition), Benford appended a new ending onto the original ending of the novel. The following section is from the second edition of the book to bridge over to the continuance of the Galactic Core Saga:





The Watcher is eventually blinded by being coated with a life-form native to the moon, which eats metals and other such materials, thus allowing the humans to board the ship.  The boarding party discovers a map of the galaxy marked with places significant to the machines, and a fast vessel to take them to those places. Now the leader, Nigel vetoes suggestions that they return to Earth and quoting 
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn
 (""Le's all slide out of here one of these nights and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns over in the territory; and I says all right, that suits me."") energizes everyone for a voyage to the Galactic Center, the most important place of all for the machines. Earth's ocean-borne myriads, now partnered with the Skimmers against the Swarmers, will just have to fend for themselves.

Premise
[
edit
]


The Empire of Khanum is surrounded by a sea wall. Each wet season, leviathans emerge from the deep ocean and are turned back by imperial weaponry. Imperial citizens live in constant fear of a breach in the walls.

The administrative branch of the Empire includes factions called Iyalets; these include the Iudex (investigators), Legion (armed forces), Engineers (infrastructure), and Apothetikals (botanical modification). Apothetikals use leviathan-derived technology to modify both plants and humans, giving them special powers. Humans who have received apothetikal modifications are called sublimes. Several types of sublimes include engravers (who have perfect memory), axioms (who have incredible mathematical skills), and cracklers (who have enhanced physical strength).

The Empire is divided into various 
cantons
. Years before the start of the story, the canton of Oypat was overrun by a modified plant known as dappleglass. Despite the efforts of the apothetikals, no cure for dappleglass infestation was found. The entire canton was sealed off, and its citizens were evacuated to other regions.



Plot
[
edit
]


Dinios Kol, “Din”, is an engraver. He is chosen as the apprentice to Iudex investigator Anagosa Dolabra, “Ana”. The corpse of engineer Taqtasa Blas is found in a mansion owned by the wealthy Haza family. Din is sent to investigate. Blas was poisoned with dappleglass, which caused plant matter to grow instantaneously through his body. Meanwhile, a leviathan breaches the sea wall. Ana and Din learn that the engineers responsible for the wall were killed in the same manner as Blas.

Ana and Din are sent to the canton of Talagray to continue their investigation. There, they are assisted by several imperial citizens. These include Kepheus Strovi, a Legion captain with whom Din eventually begins a romance; Tuwey Uhad, an engraver; Tazi Miljin, a war hero; Ionia Nusis, an apothetikal, and Valiki Kalista, an engineer.

Din learns that all of the dead engineers were part of a secret group. Additionally, there is one missing engineer whose body was not found: Commander Jolgalgan was a survivor of Oypat, the canton which was once destroyed by dappleglass. As Ana and Din track people with connections to the dead engineers, they find more bodies. These corpses include Blas's secretary and a merchant who sold supplies to the Haza family. Ana deduces that at least two killers are involved. The first poisons people with dappleglass; the second is a sublime who kills with a sharp object to the skull.

Fayazi Haza, a daughter of the family, informs Ana that her father Kaygi Haza was murdered at his home on the night of a party. Kaygi was also killed by dappleglass. Din investigates the estate, where he finds dappleglass in the water tank. Dappleglass is triggered by water and heat, making the bathroom an ideal place for poisoning. Din realizes that the ten dead engineers were also present on the night of the party. They were all secretly receiving patronage from the Haza family. Din and the investigators later find Jolgalgan’s body; she was killed by dappleglass when her lab malfunctioned. Finally, Nusis is killed with a blow to the skull.

Ana brings Fayazi Haza to the office of the Iudex. There, she reveals her theory of the case. Jolgalgan kill Blas. She then infiltrated the party at the Haza estate and poisoned the bathwater, eventually killing Kaygi Haza. While Kaygi was in the bath, he drink from a ewer, infecting it with dappleglass spores. During the patronage meeting later that evening, all ten engineers drank from the same ewer, contracting the contagion from the cup and eventually leading to their deaths. Their deaths and the subsequent breach in the sea wall were never intended. Jolgalgan sought revenge against Blas and the Hazas for the destruction of Oypat. The Empire could have saved the canton, but the powerful Haza family blocked production of a cure as part of an economic plan to drive up the value of their own estates.

Fayazi’s axiom is revealed to be a fraud; she is actually a twitch, a sublime with incredible speed and strength. The twitch killed the secretary, the merchant, and Nusis. Ana kills the twitch with dappleglass. Ana reveals that Jolgangan was not the main perpetrator, but rather was an accomplice to the engraver Uhad. Uhad was present at the Haza mansion on the night of Kaygi's murder; he provided a distraction which allowed her to poison the water tank. Uhad has been a long-term servant of the Empire. He was motivated by a desire to combat the corruption of the gentry who allowed the destruction of an entire canton for monetary reasons.

Din is promoted to become a full assistant investigator. He spends time with Strovi in Talagray before he and Ana are sent on their next investigation."

The Vampire Tapestry
 is composed of five free-standing novella-length chapters which are stitched together to form one episodic plot, or hence the name, 
tapestry
. In the first half of the novel, the narrative is presented from the point of view of different characters as their paths cross Weyland's. In the final chapters, the focus centers on Weyland himself.



The ancient mind at work
[
edit
]


In the opening chapter of the novel, the narrative follows a woman by the name of Katje de Groot who happens to work at the same college, the Cayslin Center for the Study of Man, where Dr. Weyland is a professor. One late night, Katje observes what she fantasizes to be a vampire fleeing from the scene of a feeding session. Although she comes to the conclusion that what really happened was nothing more than an 
anthropologist
, Dr. Weyland, leaving the lab with one of his sleep subjects, her imagination begins to run wild.

When Dr. Weyland gives a public lecture on ""The Demonology of Dreams,"" Katje naturally decides to attend. During the lecture, the subject of vampirism gets brought up by the audience. From the back of the lecture hall, Katje watches in astonishment as Dr. Weyland provides uncanny insight into how vampires might actually look and behave. For example, they might utilize a needle in their tongue to extract blood rather than having the more conspicuous 
canine
 fangs (page 37).

The next day, Katje compliments Weyland on his lecture. He returns the compliment by inviting her to participate in his sleep study. Initially, she refuses the offer but eventually reconsiders. When she reaches the lab, however, Weyland forces Katje back to his car. While trying to escape from Weyland, Katje manages to shoot him twice. The chapter ends with Weyland driving off into the distance.



The land of lost content
[
edit
]


The second chapter begins with a pair of bystanders finding Weyland collapsed at the wheel of his 
Mercedes-Benz
. When Weyland refuses the men's offer to alert the authorities, they plot to capitalize on the suspicious nature of his situation. After pawning the car, a friend of the bystanders proceeds to tend to Weyland's injuries. Weyland's state of medical emergency leads him to rip out an 
IV
 and begin drinking the blood coming from the other end. This queer activity subsequently leads the men to sell Weyland to a man named Roger.

Roger holds Weyland captive in the spare room of his 
Manhattan
 apartment where he plans to display the vampire as a museum exhibit. The situation gets complicated when Roger's nephew Mark, the protagonist of the chapter, empathically befriends Weyland. Before long, Roger employs the aid of a 
satanist
 by the name of Alan Reese to market Weyland's captivity. When Alan's feeding schedule forces Weyland into 
starvation
, Mark intervenes. In doing so, Weyland is able to escape the confines of Roger's apartment and bring the chapter to a close.



Unicorn tapestry
[
edit
]


Just as the first two chapters are told from the point of view of Katje and Mark respectively, ""Unicorn Tapestry"" offers a new perspective on Weyland from yet another source, Dr. Floria Landauer. Floria is a 
psychotherapist
 who has been asked to counsel Dr. Weyland by Doug Sharpe, the dean of Cayslin College (page 122). Initially Weyland is resistant to Floria's sessions, claiming for example that he is being made ridiculous by her techniques (128). Eventually he warms up to her therapy and even begins to embrace it. He begins by coyly admitting his ""
delusions
"" of being a vampire (126), but this flowers into explications of his hunting habits (136), 
sexuality
 (141), take on 
humanity
 (148), and much more. Ultimately, Weyland sees the therapy sessions as a method of self-discovery for he has no knowledge of his origin and no other members of his species to interact with (158).

One day when Floria arrives at her office, her secretary Hilda exclaims that someone has been through their records. Floria immediately realizes that the perpetrator was Weyland and that he had confiscated all incriminating evidence of his condition. That evening when Floria returns home, Weyland is waiting for her. After acquiring a written testament to his mental well-being, Weyland threatens to kill Floria. Floria is able to convince him otherwise however by offering to fulfill his sexual curiosities. In the end, Weyland accepts her offer and leaves her be as he flees to 
New Mexico
.



A musical interlude
[
edit
]


Shortly after arriving in 
Albuquerque, New Mexico
, Weyland's colleagues invite him to attend an opera in 
Santa Fe
. During the drive over, Weyland begins to feel sick; he fed before leaving and never had the chance to rest (which upsets his system). Halfway through the performance, Weyland's upset stomach gets the best of him, and he is forced to leave the show. While wandering around the perimeter of theatre, Weyland comes across a man whom he attacks and kills. The kill was unprovoked, utilized a technique which Weyland had not used in years, and was not done out of hunger. Although confused by his own actions, Weyland is forced to focus on disposing the body. After doing so, Weyland re-enters the opera and reflects upon his actions.



The last of Dr. Weyland
[
edit
]


In the final chapter, Weyland remains in 
New Mexico
 as he continues his professorship at the 
University of New Mexico
. As a hunter, 
Albuquerque
 provides Weyland with a new set of challenges which he had not faced while in New York at Cayslin. In particular, the size of the city hinders Weyland's anonymity. Consequently, Weyland must establish a reliable social network from which to prey upon. One such member of this network is Alison Beader, a teaching assistant whom Weyland also engages with sexually. When Weyland is forced to sever his connection with Alison for fear that she is becoming too close to him, he finds himself between reliable food sources. One night he chooses to drive to a nearby campground to satisfy his hunger.

In parallel with Weyland's relationship to Alison, Weyland also begins to forge a relationship with a fellow 
anthropologist
 named Irv. One day Weyland is approached by a woman named Dorothea Winslow, a friend of Irv, and is asked if Irv has been acting himself lately. Weyland is indifferent to the question and answers that he is not sure. Soon after this encounter, Irv commits suicide and dedicates a large portion of his final letter to Weyland, drawing much unwanted attention to him. When Weyland returns home after the incident, Alan Reese is waiting for him. Alan claims that he knows about Floria and saw Weyland feeding at the campground. Alan holds Weyland at gunpoint, but Weyland is eventually able to reverse the situation by tricking Alan into thinking that he can turn him into a vampire. Rather than doing so, Weyland kills him. With growing fear of becoming discovered, Weyland is forced to enter a state of 
hibernation
 and the novel is brought to a close."

The empire of 
Songmaster
 is a place of treachery, resembling that of 
ancient Rome
 and the 
Galactic Empire
 of 
Isaac Asimov
's 
Foundation series
. The book is morally ambivalent.  True love, both heterosexual and homosexual, are major themes as are loyalty and honor. Fraud, kidnapping, assassination, murder are also prevalent and each of them is shown in more than one light. As with many of Card's works, this story is more about the interplay of people, and their moral issues, than it is about technology, although the Empire clearly has advanced technology.



The Songbird
[
edit
]


The core of the story is the idea that young boys and girls are selected and acquired at a very early age on account of their singing abilities.  The children are taken away from normal life and trained to sing.  They are given drugs that delay puberty for five years.  The drugs also make them sterile.  A few specially talented singers are designated as 
Songbirds
, ""Songbirds are given only to those who can truly appreciate them. We invite people to accept them. We do not take applications.""  Songbirds are sold to worthy wealthy clients and stay with them till their fifteenth birthday when they return to the 
Songhouse
.  Singers who fail to make the grade do not necessarily have fulfilling lives even though the Songhouse takes care of their material needs.

Ansset is seen as special and taken under the wing of Esste, a senior 
Songmaster
.  She takes him out into the real world, but only for a few days, a man remarking of the boy, ""If he's willing to take off his clothes, he can make a fortune."" Because of his talent, he is sent to the Emperor Mikal himself to sing.  When he is aged 9, Riktors Ashen collects Ansset from the Songhouse and is captivated by his beauty, ""the kind of face that melted men's hearts as readily as women's.  More readily.""



The theme of man/boy love
[
edit
]


Ansset first experiences unwanted sexual attention in the form of a palace guard who searches him in preparation for his first meeting with Mikal. The guard suffers a steep price for lingering just a little too long, a harsh punishment swiftly dealt by Mikal on Ansset's word. Very soon after his induction into the palace and into Mikal's life, rumors circulate that surely, such a beautiful boy would have shared the emperor's bed. On a student group visitation to the palace, however, Kya-Kya, a former member of the Songhouse, silently debunks such rumors:

""They all wondered, of course, if a boy of such great beauty had found his way into Mikal's bed. Kya-Kya knew better. The Songhouse would never tolerate it. They would never send a Songbird to someone who would try such a thing."" pg 130

A Songbird is only gifted to a person who has been judged to possess a soul capable of fully appreciating such beauty. A man or woman who would wish such great harm as sexual abuse would never be considered as a candidate for a Songbird. Ansset is loved by Mikal and loves him back, but neither Mikal, nor his successor Riktors, wish to have a sexual relationship with the boy.

Kya-Kya (Kyaren) is a girl a few years older than Ansset who leaves the Songhouse and works her way up to a senior position on Earth. Eventually she ends up working for Ansset when he is fifteen (though he still has the body of a 10-year-old).  Kyaran has a boyfriend called Josif who is, in his own words, sixty two percent homosexual and the rest heterosexual.  Josif was loved by a slightly older boy when he himself was a ""shy child of unusual beauty"".

Josif falls in love with Ansset the first time he meets him. He tries to avoid seeing the boy again, but this is impossible.  As he slowly starts to mature, growing 17 centimetres, Ansset starts to seek out Josif's company more and more. Josif and Kyaren have a baby boy by now, but Ansset begins to realise that Josif is sexually attracted to him, as many people have been before.  He recognises however, that Josif's love is different from the lust he has seen so often.  Ansset starts to feel new longings. He knows that the drugs cause problems for Songbirds, particularly boys, but he has lost his songs and wants to know what happens next. Ansset eventually offers himself to the young man, saying, ""I know what you want, and I'm willing"".  Josif lovingly brings the boy to his first climax.  As Ansset experiences his first ever orgasm, he experiences enormous pain. The Songhouse drugs have almost killed him and he is forever impotent. Josif runs to find help and is captured by security forces, who take him to the palace at Susquehanna where Riktors has him drugged and castrated for his relations with Ansset. He then commits suicide by stuffing a bed sheet down his throat.

This novel follows 
Dragonsdawn
 and the short story 
The Dolphin's Bell
 (short story contained in 
The Chronicles of Pern: First Fall
) by discussing the present state (Ninth Pass) of the dolphins that were brought to Pern by the colonists. Set near the end and after the events of 
All the Weyrs of Pern
 it further integrates the science fiction aspects of the origins of the 
Pern
 series with the fantastical aspects presented by the original books.

The plot focuses primarily on two young characters and chronicles the birth of the Dolphincrafthall and its first Dolphineer. Readis, the Paradise River Lord Holder's son, is saved by talking dolphins (""shipfish"") as a young boy after falling into the sea and subsequently develops a strong fascination with the dolphins. T'lion, the young Eastern Weyr dragonrider of Bronze Gadareth, also develops an interest after being involved in an early dolphin encounter. The two befriend each other due to their shared interest and, in their own ways, defy family, Hold and Weyr to maintain their friendships with dolphins and convince others of the dolphins' intelligence and ability to speak. While familiar characters struggle to end the era of Thread, Readis, T'lion and others struggle to begin a new era in which dolphin and human work together again.

Well-known characters from previous Pern novels are also involved in the plot, including Benden Weyrleaders Lessa and F'lar, and Masterharpers Robinton and Menolly."

This story begins at the exact time that 
Dragon's Egg
 (its predecessor) ended.  As the human scientists in the orbiting ship 
Dragon Slayer
 prepare to leave, the Cheela on the star below continue their rapid advance. Starquake centers around two crises. The first is when the human ship is damaged, and the Cheela must repair the ship before tidal forces kill the humans aboard. Then a catastrophic 
Starquake
 strikes.  Cheela explorers in space survive but have lost the technology to land back on the surface of their world.  All Cheela on the surface perish except for four individuals.  All succeeding generations of surface Cheela are descended from these four individuals.  For a while, the surface Cheela struggle to keep the rudiments of civilization, but eventually a barbarian conqueror arises.  The Cheela in space and their human friends watch helplessly as a new dark age ensues.

The second half of the story tells the heroic tale of how the space-bound Cheela, with a little help from the humans, eventually are able to land again on the surface, defeat the barbarian tyrant, and start to rebuild Cheela civilization.  The first edition cover (shown here) depicts the climactic final battle for the surface as described in the novel."

Inferno
 is based upon the 
hell
 described in 
Dante
's 
Inferno
.  However, it adds a modern twist to the story.  The story is told in the 
first person
 by Allen Carpenter (who spelled his name ""Carpentier"" on his novels), an 
agnostic
 
science fiction
 writer who died in a failed attempt to entertain his fans at a 
science fiction convention
 party.  He finds himself in a 
Djinn
-bottle in the 
Vestibule
 on the outer edge to Hell; he spends a vast amount of time there, but is released when he finally calls upon God for mercy.  Allen is met by Benito, a 
Virgil
-like figure whose full identity is not immediately apparent. Benito offers to take Allen out of Hell by bringing him to the center.

At first, as Allen and Benito travel through Hell, Allen tries to scientifically rationalize everything he sees, renaming his surroundings as 'Infernoland', a high-tech 
amusement park
 some thousand years in the future.  It isn't until he sees a man recover from 
incineration
 and his own leg heal from a 
compound fracture
 that he starts to actually believe that he is in Hell.  From this point on, as Allen travels through the inner circles of Hell, he sees how he is guilty of each of the sins in some fashion, commenting to himself that he is in no danger from ditch 3 of circle 8 (
simony
) only because he has never had any 
holy offices
 to sell.  At first Allen views the punishments for these sins as far surpassing the crime, repeatedly thinking, ""We're in the hands of infinite power and infinite 
sadism
"", although he comes more and more to accept the justice of the situation as he realizes that it is their continuing denial of their sins that keeps many of the condemned in hell. Eventually Allen takes over Benito's role in helping reformed souls proceed on to 
Paradise
 via 
Purgatory
, allowing Benito to move on towards Purgatory himself. It is revealed that Benito is actually 
Benito Mussolini
, the former dictator of Italy.

Along the way Allen meets a number of his 
Californian
 acquaintances and notable people from history (e.g. 
Epictetus
, 
Billy the Kid
, 
Jesse James
, 
Bob Ford
, 
L Ron Hubbard
,

Hector
, 
Aeneas
, 
Charon
, 
Minos
, 
Phlegyas
,

).  Due to the long time he spent bottled up in the outer 
vestibule
 he also meets some people from the future of 1976, such as a

Originally, the 
First World War
 was a complete wake-up call for the human race, leading to greater 
internationalism
 and a ""Never Again"" spirit towards war that would eventually wear away the differences between the various power-blocs. By the 2020s, a global 
League of Nations
 oversees a planet totally at peace. The fledgling 
Nazi Party
, in this 'original' timeline, simply faded out after the 1923 
Beer Hall Putsch
.

Many in the modern 
aristocracy
, 
corporate
 dynasties, and others feel they have lost out because of the social transformations enabled by decades of peace and co-operation. This group comes up with a plan to build a functional ""time machine"" and change history for their benefit. Their scheme is to go back as far as they can (roughly a century, to the very early 1920s) and mentor the fledgling Nazi Party. They regard the Nazis as the perfect tool for destroying the 
Soviet Union
 and establishing an elitist tyranny with which they can live the lives of luxury and entitlement they believe have been stolen from them. This 'Uptime' initiative sends 21st century advisors, armament, and 
nuclear weapons
 to support 
Adolf Hitler
.

The Hitler that they seek to advise soon develops other plans. Learning about the original history from his time traveling advisors, Hitler uses these lessons to ensure that 
Western Europe
 falls swiftly, followed by dropping a few of the Uptime nuclear weapons to wipe out the Soviet Union. He then destroys his end of the ""time conduit"" and declares independence from his former sponsors. By the 1970s, 
Nazi Germany
 and the 
Empire of Japan
 have conquered everything other than 
North America
, 
Australasia
, and parts of 
South America
. 
Africa
 has suffered an enormous 
genocide
 every bit as complete as 
the one inflicted upon the
 
Jews
, and the 
Axis powers
 stand poised in 1975 to start a final war that the 
United States
 is bound to lose, given the military power of Nazi Germany.

An organization in this altered 1975 discovers the secret behind the Nazi successes of the previous decades. The group decides that it will build its own time machine to go back and stop the present nightmare of Nazi world domination. This 1975 time machine is not as advanced or powerful as the original 2020s machine, so they can only open a gate to 1939. The plan is to establish a military alliance between the 1975 America of 
President
 
John F. Kennedy
 and the 1939 America of President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt
. The team starts noticing that 
events they had no hand in are different
 (such as the 
Joe Louis
 versus 
John Henry Lewis
 fight and the death of 
Pope Pius XI
) and with Einstein's help realize that all possible outcomes already exist and all time travel does is take you to one of these other branches.

Realizing why things have gone wrong, it is up to the 1975 Uptime agents, cut off in 1939, to keep the western Allies, including the 
United Kingdom
 and the United States in the fight, while working to close off Hitler's gateway to the alternate 2020s before he gets his atomic bomb and missile advantage.

In the end, they succeed, and this second ""alternate timeline"" they create turns out to be our own world.  They also realize that the United States of their own time knew they couldn't really change their present and was in reality planning to escape to the reality they would create just as the people backing Hitler had planned to do.  To prevent their United States or Nazi Germany from invading our world they have the gate destroyed."

The first timeline takes place over two days, December 9-10th, 1012, and centers on two sisters and a brother (Ket, Ixul and Ajul) who are the last scions of a declining Mayan kingdom. As Ixul and Ajul prepare for their ascension to the throne, they are unknowingly the target of an uprising set to end their dynasty.

The more present-day timeline takes place over 6 days, December 16-21st, 2012, and centers on Leah Oliveri, a  young woman from Anoong, Minnesota, who journeys to Belize to explore her roots. She meets two Mayan guides, Xander Cañul and Javier Magaña, who are twins. They take her to the sacred cave, 
Actun Tunichil Muknal
, deep in the jungle, where she discovers a connection to 
Xibalba
, the Mayan underworld, and to the events of long ago.

The story set in the future spans most of a year, January 14 - December 20, 3012.  Humanity has been greatly reduced due to a climatic apocalypse brought on by human abuse of the environment.

The Empire of Balladaire rules over the colony of Qazāl, formerly part of the fallen Shālan Empire. Balladaire has banned all religion as “uncivilized”, but pockets of resistance still practice religion and its associated magic. Balladaire kidnaps Qazāli children to be 
conscripted
 into the Balladairan army; Touraine is 
one such child
.

As an adult, Touraine and her company of conscripts (called Sands) are ordered to return to El-Wast, the Qazāli capital. They accompany Princess Luca, heir to the throne. Luca's uncle Nicholas currently holds power. She hopes that performing well in managing Qazāl will allow her to claim the throne in her own right.

As the princess arrives in the city, Touraine saves her from an 
assassination
 attempt. Touraine is falsely accused of murdering a Balladairan guard, but Luca rescues her. Dismissed from the military, Touraine becomes Luca's servant. On Luca's orders, Touraine secretly negotiates for peace with the Qazāli rebels, while developing romantic feelings for Luca. Luca grows interested in Shālan religion and magic, knowing that openly supporting these concepts would not be accepted in Balladaire. Touraine discovers that her birth mother, Jaghotai, is a leader of the rebellion. Other rebellion leaders include Djasha, an apostate priest who has lost her magic, and her wife Aranen, a healer.

Luca agrees to give the rebels guns as part of negotiations. Worried that the Sands will bear the brunt of any violence, Touraine betrays Luca to the Balladairan military leader, General Cantic. This leads to a violent uprising and a collapse of negotiations. Touraine joins the rebellion; Luca believes she has been killed in the chaos. The rebels ally with a desert tribe known as the Many-Legged, who use animal magic. Together, they create famine and plague, hoping to drive the Balladairans from their city. Tensions in El-Wast rise due to food shortages and violence. Almost a quarter of the Balladairan forces die from plague.

The rebels invade the Balladairan Quartier, hoping to free the Sands. Touraine and the rebels confront General Cantic. Djasha is killed, Touraine is captured, and the rebels are defeated. As Touraine is about to be executed by 
firing squad
, she gains access to Shālan magic. Aranen escapes and kills Cantic. Luca agrees to leave Qazāl in exchange for the Balladairans’ safety. Touraine stays to help rebuild El-Wast."

In 1871, Carlota Moreau lives with her father, Dr. Moreau, at the 
hacienda
 Yaxaktun. She has a chronic illness and requires weekly treatments to stay healthy. Dr. Moreau's experiments involve the creation of human-animal hybrids. Carlota spends much of her time with two hybrids named Cachito and Lupe, as well as the 
mayordomo
 Montgomery.

By 1877, Moreau's financial situation is precarious. The hacienda's owner, Hernando Izalde, is losing faith that Moreau's research is a good investment. Hernando's son Eduardo visits Yaxaktun with his cousin Isidro. After a brief courtship, Eduardo proposes to Carlota. Moreau approves, hoping that this will secure his finances. Isidro disapproves, and sends Montgomery to tell Hernando.

Hernando arrives to prevent the marriage. Carlota strikes Hernando; she grows claws and hisses at him. Hernando fires Moreau and tells him to vacate the hacienda. Montgomery forces the three Izalde men to leave at gunpoint, but they promise to return with more men. Moreau reveals that Carlota is a hybrid. She does not truly need her weekly injections; he has been drugging her in order to keep her docile and to keep her jaguar traits submerged. Carlota angrily shoves Moreau, injuring him.

Carlota releases the hybrids; most of them choose to seek shelter with nearby Mayan rebels. The Izaldes return. Eduardo promises that he will still take Carlota as his mistress, but she rejects him. Montgomery and Lupe assist the other hybrids in escaping, then return for a final confrontation. Isidro, Dr. Moreau, and Hernando are all killed. In her anger, Carlota's jaguar traits emerge; she and Montgomery work together to kill Eduardo.

Montgomery and Carlota blame all of the deaths on rebels. With her inheritance, Carlota promises to build a safe home for the surviving hybrids. Montgomery leaves to search for them, but promises to return."

Creation Node
 begins in 2255 when Earth has recovered from a series of climatic and ecological disasters. Humanity has split into three socio-political alliances, the Lunar Consortium who mine whatever resources they can find on the Moon and elsewhere, the Earth-based Conservers who prohibit the use of non-renewable resources, and the Earth World Government. A group of Conservers have discovered the hypothesised 
Planet Nine
 in the 
Oort cloud
 at the outer edge of the 
Solar System
, four 
light-days
 from Earth. They left Earth 35 years ago in their 
solar powered
 craft, 
Shadow
, and have found that Planet Nine appears to be a 
primordial black hole
 that is emitting 
Hawking radiation
. Furthermore, the crew of 
Shadow
 discover that the radiation has structure, suggesting it may be a message. When they reflect the ""message"" back, the black hole changes into an Earth-like, but featureless quasi-planet. Two of the crew land on the ""planet"" to investigate and find a 
sentient
 feathered humanoid alien they name ""Feathers"".

Feathers is taken aboard 
Shadow

The narrator Joshua—at first appearing to be just over 60 years old, wakes up May 27, 2109 in an apartment on human-settled 
Mars
. With no memory of his past, he goes to his 
werp
, a voice-activated laptop computer, and learns that his name is Joshua Ali Quare and that he was born in 1968. From this 
frame story
 and a box containing several objects from his past, Quare pieces together what he believes is true about his life leading to the early 22nd century. It is soon clear that he is unburdened by any form of 
morality
.

Joshua ran away from home early in his teens to escape his abusive father, and stayed in an upstairs apartment at Gwenny's Diner. Joshua's mother, a 
Communist party
 member, surreptitiously helped him. He entered the US Army at the behest of some Party organizers, and he was put in contact with a 
KGB
 operative who provided him with an injection to keep him from receiving or transmitting AIDS (which mutates into mutAIDS and spreads soon after, wiping out a large percentage of the population of Earth). The injection also enhanced his memory, and periodically regenerates his body, so that he becomes 10 years younger with each 15-year life period. This makes him a 
longtimer
, and gives him the side-effect of having his memory wiped after every life period.

Joshua's US Army career is spent in 
Operation Desert Storm
 (the 
First Oil War
 in the novel) and the ""Second Oil War"" which culminated in a march on 
Tehran
. After the collapse of the 
Soviet Union
, the 
KGB
 diversified and became ""the Organization,"" a counter-insurgency group that supplied technical and logistic support to every side in the Eurowar, a 
NATO
-Central European Union-Russian conflict in the early 21st century. Among the innovations of the Eurowar were 
Simulation Modeling Optimizing Targeters
 (SMOTs) a jump from 
smart weapons
 to ""brilliant weapons"" that attacked an enemy country's natural resources and means of production. These weapons cause massive environmental damage to the earth, and are the predecessors of the 
memes
. Joshua, as an agent for The Organization, begins his violent operative career with a gang rape involving US soldiers, and then sets out a series of terrorist-like missions to intensify the war. During the Eurowar, Joshua raped a woman and killed her and her family (perhaps the only disturbing memory he regrets), murdered many soldiers and civilians, suppressed science and research through rape and torture, and essentially caused mayhem along with other Organization 
longtimers
, for great sums of pay. After the Eurowar ended, Joshua took in ""Alice"", a war orphan from 
Prague
 in an incident where he got the 
dog tag
 – and inspiration for future alias – ""John Childs"".

In the 2010s, the Organization abandoned Joshua, who then joined the 
Reconstruction
 after the Eurowar and worked in 
Quito
, 
Ecuador
 on the 
GeoSync
 Cable and saw with Alice the beginning of the development of 
memes
 that would unify all countries and religions, leading to the War of the Memes (referred to in some of Barnes' other books) that culminated in the takeover of Earth by 
One True
. Alice runs away, and the Organization finds and rehires Joshua to fight in the War of the Memes, for One True. By the time One True consolidated its hold on the people of Earth, Mars, the 
Jupiter
 and 
Saturn
 systems had been colonized for decades. Joshua steals another person's ID and becomes an ecoprospector on Mars.

The best scientists and engineers of free humanity had developed the technology to unleash a 
singularity
 at the edge of the 
Solar System
 that would provide a return point in time and space for the descendants of five transfer ships sent to colonize other nearby star systems. When Joshua finally ventures forth to meet his Organization contact in Red Sands City, he's confronted by a tremendous hustle and bustle of people preparing for the transfer ship descendants to arrive from the 25th century and either destroy One True (and the population on Earth under its control) or confine it there.

A fellow Organization agent named Sadi has been in Joshua's life one way or another since the inception of the Organization. On Mars, Sadi, who's also a longtimer, meets Joshua as a woman, Sadi's original gender, and now gender of choice. This is possible due to the Organization perfecting the regeneration process, now called 'revival', which also gave Sadi complete memory recovery and a permanent 20-year-old body. From Sadi, whom Joshua had met 
as
 a woman after the Eurowar and was partnered with when Sadi was male during the War of the Memes, Joshua learns that it's possible to go through the singularity to 1988, when the technology to construct it was first built and put into orbit by the Soviets. By the time of the novel's frame story, Sadi has done this thirty times, each time changing history to his/her benefit. After Joshua's revival and a time as Sadi's lover, Joshua, who's repeatedly refused to accompany Sadi on these excursions through the singularity, (also known as a 
closed timelike curve
), is sent by her via force on a preset course through the singularity once more. Sadi claims to have brought Joshua back in time with her before, without being revived, so she could 'help' Joshua love her as obsessively as Sadi loves him. Now she wants him to experience the freedom she's had, in hopes of having him come back to her for good. Joshua makes plans when he comes back to the late 20th century to change history himself, many times over, alone."

. Giving chase, Harry manages to keep Binder's henchmen from catching him with the help of 
Bob
. Nicodemus catches up with Dresden, Murphy and Butters on the street in front of 
Michael Carpenter
's house, and a fight ensues. Murphy draws Fidelacchius and is tricked into using the sword to 
attempt to kill Nicodemus while defenseless
, which results in the sword's shattering and Murphy being badly wounded. Michael then appears, offering to leave his angel-protected house in exchange for the release of Harry, Karrin and Butters. Nicodemus accepts the deal, but before Michael leaves, 
Uriel
 appears, giving Michael Amoracchius and his own Grace so that Michael can fight effectively. Nicodemus surrenders the fight and agrees to accept Michael as Harry's replacement for the wounded Murphy. That night while recovering at the Carpenters', Harry reconnects with his daughter Maggie for the first time since he saved her life at 
Chichen Itza
 in 
Changes
.

As the heist begins, the group breaks into a high security vault owned by 
John Marcone
, where Dresden opens a Way to Hades' vault in the Nevernever. Ascher and Dresden open the Gates of Fire and Ice respectively, and Deirdre willingly allows Nicodemus to kill her so that her spirit can open the final Gate of Blood. Once inside the vault, Dresden and Valmont find an altar holding not only the Grail, but four other artifacts associated with the 
crucifixion of Jesus
. Harry realizes that the vault is actually an armory, and Hades stops time to discuss the situation privately with him. Hades uses the vault to store powerful artifacts and weapons until those with the knowledge and power to wield them properly can claim them.

Armed with this knowledge, Dresden hides three artifacts in Valmont's bag and one in his sleeve before Nicodemus and the others arrive to claim the Grail. Nicodemus takes the Grail but turns on Harry and Michael after Harry angrily calls him out on murdering his own daughter for his schemes, as Valmont has gone back to the vault's entrance. Ascher and the Genoskwa (an aggressive Bigfoot) are revealed to be the new hosts for the fallen angels Lasciel and Ursiel, respectively. Nicodemus orders them and Grey to attack, breaking his agreement with Mab and leaving Harry free to act as he sees fit.

It is then revealed through a flashback that Harry had earlier hired Grey to back him up in anticipation of this fight. Grey takes on the Genoskwa/Ursiel, Dresden fights Ascher/Lasciel, and Michael fights Nicodemus after making a final appeal to his humanity. After Dresden manages to bury Ascher in a rockfall and Michael sends Nicodemus running, Grey blinds the Genoskwa, allowing the three of them to escape. On the way out, Dresden activates the Gate of Ice to crush the pursuing Genoskwa.

Dresden opens a Way and the four of them depart the Nevernever, but before they can close the Way, Nicodemus escapes and heads for Michael's house, trapping the others in Marcone's vault. The team escapes with help from Binder, and Harry and Grey hurry to confront Nicodemus at Michael's home. During the final fight, Butters takes up the broken Fidelacchius, which emits a 
lightsaber
-style blade, and chases off Nicodemus again. He agrees to become a Knight of the Cross. Molly Carpenter, Michael's daughter and Harry's former apprentice, now the new Winter Lady, arrives in time to safely remove the parasitic spirit from Harry's head.

Afterwards, the group divide up a backpack full of diamonds Valmont stole from Hades' vault. Grey turns down a share of them, instead accepting one dollar from Harry as his fee, and Harry uses that share as a 
weregild
 to pay for the death of Marcone's vault guard. He deduces that Mab, Hades, and Marcone conspired to let Nicodemus carry out the heist in order to destroy his reputation, as revenge for his earlier kidnapping of Marcone and the Archive, and confronts Mab and Marcone with his conclusions. He then visits Karrin in the hospital and the two share a passionate kiss and agree to try an actual relationship. Talking with Michael that evening, Harry reflects over the events of the past few days, and together they worry about a few things including Harry's future as the Winter Knight."

The novel is presented in three basic parts:



Part one
[
edit
]


Introduces the protagonist, paleoanthropologist Dr. Barbara Marchando, her 
African-American
 family history and her heritage. Marchando is visiting her family during Thanksgiving, recovering from a recent, bitter divorce, prompting her to seek time alone to explore an attic. She discovers her ancestor Zebulon's diary which yields an account of the arrival of strange, new animal slaves dying from disease soon after arriving and provides motivation for digging on the grounds of the family's former plantation home. The dig is originally intended to identify the approximate location of a rumored pre-Civil War slave graveyard. A large section of the graveyard is found. A smaller separate section of graves yields skeletal remains that all display the same cranial and other bodily disfigurements.  To the Dr.'s trained eye they resemble skulls known in fossil records as 
Australopithecus
, a human ancestral species that died out some 1,400,000 years before. However, these remains are at most two centuries old. They are classified as an example of the subspecies 
Australopithecus boisei
. The skeletons' classification and confirmed recent dates of death are impossible according to the accepted fossil record. Despite attempts to maintain a low profile, word of the unexpected findings leak to media. Skeptics express disbelief and ridicule the doctor's conclusions, jeopardizing her reputation and career.



Part two
[
edit
]


Research of old town records disclose the sale of a new, heartier type of slave to the former plantation's master. The vessel bringing the 'new type slave' cargo is listed by name through the shipment manifest and its port of origin in Africa is identified. Marchando wins funding to visit the African port city and search for traces of what might have been a small enclave of humans displaying traits of an early human ancestor. After several unsuccessful excursions, a promising lead at last points to a remote, isolated and unfriendly group of villagers as a source of 'worker beasts'. A translator, armed escort, Marchando and several companions make plans to visit the isolated group. Marchando and the translator question the chief about stories of white men coming long ago to buy 'worker beasts' from the village and if they might help find where such 'beasts' lived. After an agreement for information is arranged, a young, dirty, naked and malnourished 
Australopithecus boisei
 female is led by collar and leash into the hut and handed over as purchased property. Aghast, Marchando realizes she has unintentionally traded a few goods and tools for a living fossil. The chief advises that the trade is fair and that most of the village has at least one beast to perform work they avoid. As the translator explains that undoing the exchange with the chief would prove insulting & dangerous, Marchando and her team leave with the nervous, but otherwise docile female. The doctor and team set about making plans to return to the port city and sedate the female while arrangements are made to transition her to Europe and eventually the United States. The female Boisei is given the name ""Thursday"" by Marchando. This is both a reference to the day she was found, and is a literary reference to the character of Friday in 
Robinson Crusoe
.



Part three
[
edit
]


Despite efforts to maintain secrecy, word leaks. Upon reaching a research hospital facility outside 
Washington, D.C.
, and publication of the find, the shock to the scientific community and general public is intense. Marchando and other researchers are successful in teaching Thursday to communicate by 
sign language
. Thursday is soon found capable of reasoning, compassion and understanding abstract ideas like time and family; far beyond any ape's cognition. The question arises, ""what is Thursday""? She obviously is not a 
Homo sapiens
 nor an ape (
Hominidae
). 
Genetic testing
 reveals she is partly 
hybrid
 from past interbreeding of her ancestors and human captors, further confusing her status as a species. Conflicting ideas on her rights emerge. They're seen variously as better substitutes for chimpanzees in 
medical testing
, an easily trained labor force, potentially living 
organ banks
, essentially a future slave race to be considered as beasts or property. Other research centers begin plans to obtain more boisei from Africa, as specimens for study and 
zoos
. As a descendant herself of slaves, Marchando finds this unthinkable. Authorities begin efforts to access and control Thursday in the ""interest of science"", endangering her safety and life. Marchando is desperate to protect Thursday and prove she should be treated as human. She tracks Thursday's 
ovulation
 and secretly conducts an 
artificial insemination
 using sperm frozen years ago by her ex-husband. When Thursday becomes several months pregnant, she ignites a legal and moral firestorm over whether to permit her pregnancy to come full term. Before a legal decision can be reached, Thursday births a healthy, mixed female child resembling both herself and a human biological father, thus demonstrating Thursday's full genetic compatibility with modern humanity.

The novel draws parallels between the conventional thinking of centuries ago that humans from Africa were not truly 
human beings worthy of rights
. The novel's ending is left open for interpretation on what it means to be human and where a line, if any, can be drawn between ourselves and our ancestors."

Transporting a comatose Lucasinho to his father in Meridian, Luna and the Sisters of the Lords of Now are attacked by a Mackenzie Metals security team bent on abducting Lucasinho in his medical pod. They are fought off by Santinho foot-soldiers from João de Deus, but Luna's fleeing spacecraft is downed by chain-gun fire, leaving Luna, Madrinha Elis, and Lucasinho the only survivors. Lucas, having overtaken the Moon with his terrestrial allies, is now the Eagle of the Moon. Lousika tells Lucas that the Asamoahs cannot heal Lucasinho's brain damage, but suggests that the University of Farside can, on the opposite side of the Moon. Lucas's bid in the Court of Clavius for custody of Lucasinho is opposed by his ex-wife Amanda, who is acting on behalf of the Suns. They are both thwarted by Ariel, who outmaneuvers them and has Luna declared Lucasinho's guardian. Biocyberneticists at the university give Ariel the power to walk again using a spinal device.

Alexia, Lucas's Iron Hand, goes into the impoverished upper levels of Meridian and helps the people there build an intricate but illegal system for water collection and filtration. Using the name Lê, she takes their leader, who calls himself ""Jack of Blades"", as her lover. She soon realizes, however, that he is the exiled Denny Mackenzie, who murdered Lucas's brother Carlinhos, and whose grandfather Alexia herself was responsible for killing. Alexia flees the situation for a meeting with the Vorontsovs and their terrestrial allies, who outline the Lunar Bourse, their plan for converting the Moon into an automated energy resource for Earth. Duncan stresses to the Vorontsovs that the remaining Dragon families must work together against the terrestrials. Gender-neutral economist Vidhya Rao, initially a supporter of the Bourse project, begins to become disillusioned with the business model, and learns the plan involves a complete depopulation of the Moon. The Three August Sages are the 
AI
 aspects of a quantum computer which makes startlingly accurate predictions of the future, created for Whitacre Goddard by the Suns. Vidhya is the only human with whom the Sages will communicate, but when e learns that the depopulation effort will utilize deadly plagues, the Three August Sages and Whitacre Goddard attempt to assassinate er. Vidhya is aided in er escape by Madam Sun, an avatar of Lady Sun that exists in the system thanks to a 
backdoor
. Vidhya seeks Ariel's help convincing Lucas to break ties with the terrestrials and oppose the Bourse, but Ariel wants no part of it.

On Earth, Marina is struggling to overcome the Moon's adverse effects to her body, and witnesses first-hand the distrust and hatred the terrestrials have for Moon people. She decides to go back to the Moon, but the Defence Intelligence Agency tries to make her return contingent on her being their spy. Marina's sister Kessie lends her the money she needs for the ticket, and Marina secretly travels to a launch facility in Canada so she can depart before the DIA is able to do anything to stop her.

The Suns accelerate the activation of their Sun Ring, a huge band of solar energy collectors that spans the circumference of the Moon, to undercut the terrestrials by securing a significant share of the Earth's energy market. Duncan and his entourage are killed in the destruction of the Suns' Pavilion of Eternal Light, presumably orchestrated by his absent brother Bryce. Darius and Denny each claim Mackenzie Metals for their own, and a battle between Denny's new Mackenzie jackaroos and Darius's Sun soldiers ends in Denny's victory. Bryce threatens Analiese's family if she does not thwart Wagner and hand over Robson. She complies, but the thugs who take Robson kill her anyway. Wagner seeks help from Lucas, who conspires to assassinate Bryce. Alexia brings Robson's friend Haider to visit him, and Haider slips Robson a set of poisoned needles. Bryce summons Robson with the intent of having sex with the boy, but Robson kills him with the needles, and Lucas retakes João de Deus from the Mackenzies. Ariel serves Lucas with a formal challenge to trial by combat to settle Lucasinho's case. Lucas, in turn, serves a challenge to Amanda. Lucas's champion, or zashitnik, is renowned knife-fighter Mariano Gabriel Demaria, who easily defeats the zashitnik of the Suns, and Amanda's claim is dismissed. Ariel, a lawyer with no combat skills, surprises everyone by stepping in for her own zashitnik. As Ariel hoped, Lucas does the same to keep Mariano from eviscerating his sister. The Cortas break their knives on the fighting floor and move to negotiate. Ariel offers Lucas custody of Lucasinho in exchange for Ariel replacing him as Eagle of the Moon. Lucas agrees, and gives Ariel the codes to control the terrestrials' new combat bots, which he acquired by way of a deal with Amanda.

The Corta entourage, fleeing on a ship with Nik Vorontsov, are pursued by older combat bots immune to Ariel's codes. Luna's ghazi escort Dakota and Ariel's zashitnik Rosario don sasuits and neutralize two dangerous bots sabotaging the ship from out on the hull. Later, Lucas asks Ariel why she wanted to be the Eagle, and she tells him about Vidhya's warning. Ariel has all the terrestrial representatives on the Moon brought to Boa Vista as leverage in her negotiations with Earth. She abolishes the Four Elementals, making air, water, carbon, and data free for everyone on the Moon."

At the beginning of the 20th century, January Scaller lives in a big mansion with her guardian, Cornelius Locke. What may seem to be a privileged existence is marred by the strict rules imposed on the red-skinned girl, the meager living quarters assigned to her, and the fact that her father, Julian, who works for Locke, is almost never around.

When she was seven, January discovered a magic door, which was then destroyed. Her guardian convinces her it was only her imagination, and determines to raise her to be a ""proper"" lady. Locke entertains his fellows from the New England Archeological Society, and these men treat January as a curiosity, sometimes making her feel vaguely threatened. January often explores the artifacts kept throughout the mansion, convinced her father—who is distant even when he is home from hunting special artifacts for Locke—is leaving items for her in a chest, in order to communicate with her. She becomes concerned when he fails to return from his most recent trip.

January's only companions are Jane, an African mystery woman sent by Julian to be her companion and protector, and Bad, short for Sinbad, her loyal dog. When she was younger, she was friends with Samuel Zappia, the grocer's boy, but as she grew older the contact between them fizzled out.

When January finds a special book in the chest, 
The Ten Thousand Doors
, she is more than intrigued. The book tells of a young woman from 
the South
 who meets a young man who comes through a mysterious door. Though the encounter is brief, the girl is completely enamored. When she returns to the spot again, she finds the door burnt down. She becomes determined to find her young man by exploring the world to find another door.

At the start, January believes the work is fiction. But when Locke tells her that Julian is dead, she sparks her latent power to bend reality to her will through the written word. She uses her power to escape what has now become an acutely dangerous situation with Locke and his cohort, and embarks on an entirely unexpected adventure with Jane, Samuel and Bad. It turns out that her story and the story in her book are intertwined, and that the thousands of doors are real, scattered all over our world, each connecting to another world."

The novel opens with the arrival of an evil entity countless years before the dawn of humanity and life as it is known on earth. It eventually manages to meet and coerce a human boy to serve it, with the goal of eventually returning to its true strength.

Decades later, graduate student and adjunct professor Jeremy Freirs decides to rent a renovated chicken coop located in the New Jersey countryside. The property sits on the farm of Sarr Poroth, who along with his wife Deborah, belong to a restrictive and conservative religious sect that prides itself on eschewing modern conveniences and the modern world as a whole. Prior to traveling to the farm Jeremy meets Carol, a library assistant and failed 
novitiate
 to whom he is drawn. While they believe their meetings to be random coincidence, in truth they were orchestrated by the elderly Mr. Rosebottom, the human boy from so long ago.

Rosebottom's goal is to guide Carol through a series of rituals preparing her for a final one to be held on 
Lammas
, using her naiveté to ensure that she is unaware of her participation. This final ritual will use Carol's body to birth the evil entity. Jeremy is to be killed and reanimated by the entity so it can serve as its own ""father"". While Rosebottom is busy in the city with Carol, a remnant of the entity manages to possess one of the Poroth's cats and eventually Deborah herself, in the process killing its hosts. As the rituals continue the arcane magic results in dramatic environmental changes in New Jersey and New York, as well as disturbances in the Poroth's religious community and the formation of a suspected volcano in an area close to the Poroth farm. This causes the community to believe that Jeremy's presence is the cause.

On the night of the ceremony Rosebottom arrives with Carol to the Poroth farm. It works with Rosebottom to prepare the volcanic hill for the ritual, however they fail to obtain Jeremy as a host. The entity instead possesses Sarr, discarding Deborah's body in a wasp-filled shed, unintentionally trapping the insects. It also manages to abscond with Carol, after drugging both her and Jeremy and tying them up. As the community arrives to force Jeremy to leave, Rosebottom hides in the shed, unaware that it is full of angry wasps, and is stung to death. The angry religious members arrive and discover Jeremy, unconscious and tied up. When he comes to, Jeremy realizes where the entity has taken Carol and manages to arrive just as the ceremony is in progress but has not been completed. He manages to defeat the entity; however, a remnant of it escapes.

The book ends with Jeremy and Carol walking through New York City. The pair are now married and while the ceremony was seemingly unsuccessful, Jeremy briefly worries that the entity is still out there."

In 2075, the 
Moon
 (Luna) is used as a 
penal colony
 by Earth's government, with three million inhabitants (called ""Loonies"") living in underground cities. Most Loonies are discharged criminals, political exiles, and their free-born descendants; men outnumber women two to one, so 
polyandry
 and 
polygamy
 are the norm. Due to the Moon's low surface gravity, people who remain longer than six months undergo ""irreversible physiological changes"", and can never again live comfortably under Earth 
gravity
, making ""escape"" back to Earth impractical.

The Warden holds power through the Federated Nations' Lunar Authority, but his main responsibility is to ensure delivery of vital wheat shipments to Earth; he seldom intervenes in the affairs of the discharged and free-born population, allowing a virtual 
anarchist
 or self-regulated 
pioneer
 society to develop.

Lunar infrastructure and machinery are largely managed and controlled by ""HOLMES IV"" (""High-Optional, Logical, Multi-Evaluating Supervisor, Mark IV""), the Lunar Authority's master computer, on the premise that having a single, large-capacity computer to run everything is cheaper (though not safer) than multiple independent systems.

Book 1: That Dinkum Thinkum
[

Endlessly curious, Mike asks Mannie to attend an anti-Lunar Authority political meeting, which Mannie does with a hidden recorder. When police raid the meeting, he flees with Wyoming (""Wyoh"") Knott, a visiting female political activist, whom he hides and introduces to Mike. Mannie also introduces Wyoh to his mentor, the elderly Professor (""Prof"") Bernardo de la Paz, a former political exile and esteemed Lunar educator. Prof claims that Luna must stop exporting 
hydroponic
 grain to Earth immediately, or its ice-mined water resources will eventually be exhausted. Wyoh believes the danger is not imminent and is focused on freedom and economic issues, while Mannie is not interested in what he sees as a lost cause either way. Joining the discussion, Mike calculates that continuing current policy will lead to 
food riots
 in seven years, 
cannibalism
 in nine. Shocked, the three humans ask him to calculate the chance of them overthrowing the Authority and averting the disaster. He gives them one chance in seven.

Mannie, Wyoh, and Prof create a 
covert cell
 organization protected by Mike, who controls the telephone and other systems, acts as secretary and becomes ""Adam 
Selene
, Chairman of the Committee for Free Luna."" Wyoh is hidden by the Davis Family 
line marriage
, at least four of whose nine members become active in the conspiracy, and Wyoh herself ultimately marries into the family. Mannie saves the life of 
Comte
 Stuart (""Stu"") Rene LaJoie, an Earth tourist who is recruited and tasked with turning public opinion on Earth in favor of Lunar independence.

Following the failed raid on the political meeting, the Lunar Authority sends convict-troops to 'police' the colony, creating friction and unrest, which the revolutionaries encourage; when six troopers commit a rape and double-murder, anti-Authority riots erupt. Although it preempts their plans, Loonies and Mike overcome the soldiers and seize power from the Warden. As Earth will try to retake the colony, the revolutionaries prepare to defend themselves with ""convict tools,"" and convert the 
electromagnetic catapult
 used to export wheat into a weapon for counterattack.



Book 2: A Rabble in Arms
[
edit
]


Mike impersonates the Warden and others in messages to Earth, to give the revolutionaries time to organize their preparations, while Prof sets up an ""
ad hoc
 Congress"" to distract and contain various ""self-appointed political scientists"" (nicknamed ""yammerheads"") and serve the Committee's ends. When Earth finally learns the truth, Luna declares its independence on July 4, 2076, the 300th anniversary of the 
United States' Declaration of Independence
, with its own declaration modeled on the latter.

Mannie and Prof go to Earth (despite the crushing gravity) to plead Luna's case. They are received in the Federated Nations' headquarters in 
Agra
, and embark on a world tour advocating Luna's right to self-government, while urging Earth's national governments to build a catapult to return water and nutrients to Luna in exchange for wheat. In a public-relations ploy, the dark-skinned Mannie is briefly arrested by local 
racist
 
bigots
 on charges of incitement to public 
immorality
 and 
polygamy
. Ultimately the Lunar Authority rejects their proposals and counters with a plan to turn 
all
 Loonies into indentured farmers. Their mission ended, Prof, Stu and Mannie escape back to Luna.

Prof reveals that the purpose of the mission was not to convince Terra to recognize Luna's independence, which was considered an unattainable goal at that point, but to sow division while unifying their own people, and they were successful. Public opinion on Earth has become fragmented; news of Mannie's arrest, coupled with an attempt to 
bribe
 him into becoming the next Warden of an enslaved Luna,  unify the normally 
apolitical
 Loonies. An election held in their absence (with Mike's ""help"") has voted Mannie, Wyoh, Prof and most of their backers into an elected, constitutional government.



Book 3: TANSTAAFL!
[
a
]
[
edit
]


The Federated Nations of Earth send an infantry force to subdue the Lunar revolution but the troops, with superior arms but no experience in low-gravity underground combat, are wiped out by Loony men, women and children, who suffer three times the number of casualties, among them Mannie's youngest wife. Prof and Mike take the opportunity to give his ""Adam Selene"" alter ego a hero's death, forever concealing the fact that ""Adam"" never had a corporeal existence to begin with.

In retaliation, Luna's government deploys its catapult weapon. When Mike 
launches rocks
 at sparsely populated locations on Earth, warnings are released to the press detailing the times and locations of the bombings, which deliver kinetic energy equivalent to atomic blasts. Scoffers, sightseers, and religious groups who travel to some of the sites die, turning Earth public opinion against the fledgling nation.

Earth mounts a retaliatory 
sneak attack
 to end the menace and the rebellion, sending ships in a wide orbit approaching from Luna's far side. The attack destroys the Authority's original catapult and takes Mike offline, but the Committee had built a secondary, hidden catapult before the revolt. With Mannie as acting Prime Minister and on-site commander, entering trajectories by hand, Luna continues to bombard a dismayed Earth, until constituent governments break ranks with the Federated Nations and concede Luna's independence. Prof, as leader of the nation, proclaims their national freedom to the gathered crowds before falling dead of heart failure, caused by stress. Mannie goes through the motions, but he and Wyoh eventually withdraw from politics altogether, and find that the new government falls short of their 
utopian
 expectations, following predictable patterns of all governments.

When Mannie tries to access Mike, he finds that the computer, disconnected by the bombardment, has apparently lost its self-awareness; despite repairs, its voice-activated files are inaccessible. Although otherwise functional as a normal computer, ""Mike"" is gone. Mourning his best friend, Mannie asks: ""
Bog
, is a computer one of Your creatures?""

It is 1345, and in the English town of Ansby (in northeastern 
Lincolnshire
), Sir Roger, Baron de Tourneville, is recruiting a military force to assist king 
Edward III
 in the 
Hundred Years' War
 against France. Suddenly, an enormous silver spacecraft lands outside the town. It is a scouting craft for the Wersgorix Empire, a brutal dominion light years from the 
Solar System
. The Wersgorix hope to take over Earth and are testing the feasibility of colonization. However, the aliens, having forgotten 
hand-to-hand combat
 since it was made obsolete by their advanced technology, are caught off-guard by the angered Englishmen, who mistake the craft for a French trick. The villagers and soldiers in Ansby storm the craft and kill all but one Wersgor, Branithar.

Sir Roger formulates a plan that with the captured ship, he can take the entire village to France to win the war, and then 
liberate the Holy Land
. The townspeople, with all of their belongings, board the ship at the baron's instruction, and prepare to take off. The people of Ansby are mystified at the advanced technology aboard the ship, which they come to call the 
Crusader

 in the process. Word spreads of the invaders and a meeting is arranged between Sir Roger and his soldiers and the chief of Tharixan, Huruga.

The humans and Wersgor hold talks that do very little to give either side any advantage, but a truce is agreed to. Sir Roger, in order to intimidate the aliens, makes up 
tall tales
 about his estate, ""which only took up three planets"" and his other accomplishments, including a very successful conquest of 
Constantinople
. Sir Roger demands that the entire Wersgorix state submit to the king of England. During the talks, Baron de Tourneville ignores the truce, and orders the capture of the 
fortress
 of Stularax. Unfortunately, the entire base is obliterated by an 
atomic bomb
. In retaliation, Huruga attacks Ganturath again, but loses. He is forced to give up.

Now comes Sir Roger's most outrageous plan; having captured Tharixan, he sets out to overthrow the Wersgorix Empire itself. He enlists the help of three other races oppressed by the Wersgor: the Jairs, the Ashenkoghli, and the Prʔ*tans.

Meanwhile, one of his main soldiers and friend, Sir Owain Montbelle, hatches a plan to return to Earth, something that Sir Roger has lost interest in. With Lady Catherine, Sir Roger's wife, Montbelle corners the baron and demands that he help the people of Ansby get back to Earth. De Tourneville gives in, but attacks Sir Owain in person. At the climax, Lady Catherine betrays Montbelle and kills him herself. Unfortunately, she also destroys the notes that could have helped get the villagers of Ansby back home.

Sir Roger goes on to topple the Wersgor Empire and build one for himself. He manages with the help of not only the species under the Wersgor, but from members of the Wersgor race who rebelled against their government. The religious figures in the story go on to establish a new branch of the Roman Catholic Church.



Prologue and epilogue

A millennium after the main events of 
The High Crusade
, the holy galactic empire founded by Sir Roger and his people finally reunites with long lost Earth. A spacecraft from Earth comes across the empire, and is welcomed by the descendants of one of Sir Roger's leading soldiers.

There is, in the epilogue, a reference to events on Earth since 1345. The captain of the Earth ship is described as being a loyal subject of an Israeli empire. It also appears that Huruga wound up as an archbishop."

In the early 21st century, 
NATO
 and the 
Soviet Union
 are on the verge of a second 
nuclear war
. Incidentally, a 290 km 
prolate spheroid
 has been detected following an anomalous energy burst just outside the 
Solar System
. It is an asteroid, and a duplicate of 
Juno
.  It moves into an 
eccentric
 near-Earth orbit where the rival polities of Earth each try to claim this mysterious object.

Juno has been hollowed out along its long axis, subdivided into seven cylindrical chambers, and rotates to provide 
artificial gravity
. The chambers are 
terraformed
, with the second and third containing cities that have been maintained by automatic systems for centuries. This small world is dubbed ""the Stone"" by the Americans, ""the Potato"" by the Soviets, ""the Whale"" (
鲸
) by the Chinese and ""
Thistledown
"" by its absent makers. Explorers of its interior discover that the end of the Stone's seventh chamber opens into ""the Way"", a corridor that extends beyond the size of the asteroid endlessly. The Stone’s original inhabitants have been evacuated into the Way at some time in its past, which is the explorers’ future.

At the opening of the novel, in 2005, Judith Hoffmann, head of the commission that coordinates the exploration of the Stone, recruits theoretical physicist Patricia Vasquez, who arrives at the Stone and receives clearance for all the information discovered by the existing science teams, including libraries that describe a 
nuclear holocaust
—""the Death""—taking place in 2005. Only some 
NATO
 science teams are privy to this information. Chinese and Russian science teams are present, but politically restricted.

Since the Stone appears before the recorded date of the Death, and there is no record of the Stone's appearance in its libraries, the scientists reason that the Stone may come from an 
alternate future
, but it turns out the Death is indeed imminent even with the Stone—whose appearance may have worsened the political situation. Angered by the restrictions placed on its scientists, the USSR sends space-assault teams to attack the Stone, triggering the Death and a 
nuclear winter
 on Earth that isolates survivors from all factions on the Stone.

The descendants of the Stone's creators live a million kilometers into the Way and 1,200 years into Vasquez's future, in a society called the Hexamon. They have been secretly observing the explorers. Olmy, a humanoid agent of the Hexamon, and his nameless alien Frant colleague, kidnap Vasquez as she begins to discover secrets of the Stone and the Way. They take her to Axis City, their main settlement. Four of her colleagues search for her using a specially-modified 
V/STOL
 craft connected to a ""tuberider"", a device that allows the craft to be hitched to the tubular singularity that runs through the center of the Way.

The rescuers are intercepted when they near Axis City and reunited with Vasquez, who is caught up in the politics of the Hexamon. It is presided over by a governing body, the Nexus, loosely divided into two social groups: Progressive Geshels, who embrace body-swapping and life-extending technologies, and conservative Naderites. The latter are named after 
Ralph Nader
, who has become identified with empathy and opposition to nuclear war in the centuries since his death. The Hexamon control traffic through spacetime “gates” in the Way’s surface that lead to other worlds, and are threatened by alien invaders called the Jart, who are more adapted to the physics of the Way and live beyond its 2x10^9 kilometer (2 billion kilometer) point.

The Jart attempt to destroy the Hexamon by opening a gate into the heart of a star, allowing superheated plasma to enter. To counter the threat, a coalition within the Hexamon seizes control of the Nexus. The first part of their plan involves accelerating some tuberiding human habitats to near light-speed. Scientists theorize that the shockwave thus generated will protect them from the blast of stellar plasma, while simultaneously sealing open gates along the Way and destroying their enemies, the Jart. The second half of their plan requires the separation of the Stone from the Way. When this is done, two more Hexamon habitats join the Stone in Earth orbit, at the time just after the Death."

While walking in the woods near the small town of Haven, Maine, Roberta ""Bobbi"" Anderson, a writer of 
Wild West
-themed fiction, stumbles upon a metal object that turns out to be a protrusion of a long-buried alien spacecraft. Once exposed, the spacecraft begins to release an invisible gas into the atmosphere that gradually transforms people into beings similar to the aliens who populated the ship. The transformation, or ""becoming"", provides them with a limited form of genius which makes them very inventive but does not provide any philosophical or ethical insight into their inventions, and they often do not understand the principles of the inventions (one of them admits, ""We're builders, not understanders""). The spacecraft also prevents those affected by it from leaving town, provokes psychotic violence in some people, and causes the disappearance of a young boy, David Brown, whose older brother Hilly teleports him to the planet referred to as Altair 4 by the Havenites (a reference to 
Forbidden Planet
).
[

]


The book's central character is James Eric Gardener, a poet and friend of Bobbi, who goes by the nickname ""Gard"". He is somewhat immune to the ship's effects because of the 
steel plate
 in his head, a souvenir of a teenage skiing accident. Gard is also an alcoholic and is prone to binges that result in violent outbursts followed by lengthy blackouts.

As Bobbi is almost totally overcome by the euphoria of ""becoming"" one with the spacecraft, Gard increasingly sees her health worsen and her sanity disappear. Gard feels he has little to live for aside from his friendship with Bobbi and decides to stay with her to try to halt her decline. He witnesses the transformation of the townspeople, discovers the torture and mutilation of Bobbi's dog Peter, and people being killed or worse when they pry too deeply into the strange events.

Over the course of several weeks, Gard, Bobbi, and others continue to unearth the ship. Bobbi and Gard eventually enter the ship; as they explore the ship, Gard realizes that the ship crashed because the crew was fighting with each other, and that the Tommyknockers have no moral limits to keep them from using living beings as organic batteries. As they leave the ship and return to Bobbi's home, Gard plans to kill Bobbi as he can see she is no longer human. Using a gun, Bobbi forces Gard to swallow a lethal dose of 
Valium
. As they talk, he shields his mind, pulls his own gun out, and shoots Bobbi. As Bobbi dies, she telepathically screams and alerts the townspeople, who then swarm to her home, intent on killing Gard for fear that he intends to harm the ship. Ev Hillman, David and Hilly's grandfather, helps Gard escape into the woods in exchange for saving David Brown from Altair 4.

Gard enters the ship, near death after his struggle with the townspeople. With his last ounce of strength, he activates the ship and telepathically launches it into space. This results in the eventual deaths of nearly all of the changed townspeople, but prevents the possibly disastrous consequences of the ship's influence spreading to the outside world. Very shortly afterward, agents from the 
FBI
, 
CIA
, and ""
The Shop
"" invade Haven and take as many of the Havenites as possible (killing nearly a quarter of the survivors), along with a few of the devices created by the altered people of Haven. In the last pages, David Brown is discovered safe in Hilly Brown's hospital room.

The events of 
Ark
 overlap with those of 
Flood
: in preparation for a flood that will completely submerge the Earth's continents by 2052, the billionaire Nathan Lammockson builds 
Ark Three
, a gigantic ship that will sail the waters of the drowned Earth. Skeptical of the project's viability, the U.S. government recruits billionaires Edward Kenzie, Patrick Groundwater, and Jerzy Glemp to fund the construction of 
Ark One
 (later renamed 
Project Nimrod
), a generation ship capable of 
superluminal
 travel using an 
Alcubierre warp drive
. The plan is to fly 
Ark One
 to an 
Earth-like exoplanet
 and 
rebuild civilisation on the new world
[
broken anchor
]
. The nature of 
Ark Two
 is top secret.

Ark One
 requires 80 humans of maximum genetic diversity to prevent 
inbreeding
 among their descendants, to be trained from a young age in spaceship maintenance. These ""Candidates""  include: Holle Groundwater, daughter of Patrick, specialising in 
life support systems
; Zane Glemp, son of Jerzy, specialising in warp drive physics; Kelly Kenzie, daughter of Edward, a natural leader who is named mission commander; and Wilson Argent, a pilot. They train in an academy in 
Denver
, Colorado, repurposed as the U.S. capital after the flooding of Washington, D.C.

Progress on the Ark's construction is slow, so the military takes over the Project. Initial plans to assemble the Ark in space are scrapped in favor of a 
Project Orion
-style nuclear drive, which will send the ground-built Ark towards 
Jupiter
. There, it will gather antimatter particles created by gravitational interactions with 
Io
 to power the warp drive; in addition, a 
sunshade
 will allow its telescopes to conduct 
spectroscopic analysis
 of exoplanets in the hopes of discovering the chemical signatures of 
life
.

Mere weeks before the launch, some Candidates are forced out to make room for ""gatecrashers,"" whose presence on the ship was guaranteed in exchange for funding from their affluent parents. Grace Gray, a protagonist of 
Flood
, is one of them. In addition, military 
mutineers
 (nicknamed ""Illegals"" by the crew) force their way onto the ship. Nevertheless, the launch is successful, and by 2042, they have gathered more than enough antimatter and head for a promising ""Earth II"" planet in the 
82 Eridani
 system. During transit, it emerges that Zane has 
dissociative identity disorder
 due to abusive parenting and sexual molestation by his Academy tutor, while Wilson begins challenging Kelly's leader status. A pregnant Grace gives birth to a daughter, Helen, and the crew suffer deaths and damage during a fire caused by a Candidate's attempted murder of an Illegal. Kelly loses respect when she 
amputates
 the instigator as punishment, which increases Wilson's power.

9 years later, they arrive and discover that Earth II is sub-optimal: its high axial tilt creates temperature extremes on either side of its equator, making minimal land livable. It is also poor in 
minerals
, presumably exhausted by a previous civilisation that left ruined buildings behind. The crew are of three minds over what to do next: Wilson, Holle, and Grace join a majority deciding to push on to ""Earth III"", which is 30 years' travel away in the constellation of 
Lepus
. Kelly leads a group returning to Earth while a minority colonises Earth II. Once the colonists land, the remaining passengers split up the ship's two hulls, and the warp drive to go their separate ways, losing 
simulated gravity
 in the process.

When Kelly's group 
water land
 on the flooded Earth, they make radio contact with scientist Thandie Jones, who discovered the cause of the flooding in 
Flood
. She, in turn, contacts Edward Kenzie, who despatches a submarine to take them to Ark Two, which turns out to be an 
underwater habitat
 powered by the geothermal heat of 
Yellowstone
. Edward berates his daughter for failing him, and Kelly learns that former Candidate Don Meisel and Ground Control commander Gordo Alonzo have both died battling angry 
displaced persons
. She awkwardly reunites with her estranged son and her lover from her Academy days. Edward hopes to eventually colonise the Earth's 
mantle
 with a race of genetically modified humans. (Baxter had explored a similar idea in the novel 
Flux
).

Meanwhile, the situation in Holle's hull deteriorates as Wilson leads a corrupt gang with his Illegal henchmen. Kelly had kidnapped the ship's only doctor, so Zane is no longer undergoing 
therapy
 and spreads rumours that the ship is a virtual reality simulation. The shipborn children, having never seen Earth for themselves, believe him and start a mutiny. Hoping to reveal the ship to be a simulation, they remove a metal plate from the hull, causing an 
uncontrolled decompression
 which kills and injures many passengers. Wilson escapes in a landing shuttle, but it has been sabotaged, so he returns to the ship in a space suit while the shuttle disintegrates from the warp drive's gravitational effects. A despondent Zane later commits suicide.

Holle assumes control of the ship and executes the head mutineer but keeps Wilson alive because she needs his piloting skills to land on Earth III, a cold 
tidally locked
 planet with dense air, a dynamic atmosphere, and a 
red dwarf
 sun that fortunately appears a familiar white to the human eye. Since the remaining shuttle cannot seat all the passengers, Holle encourages the passengers to reproduce copiously. Since children weigh little, many will fit on the shuttle, thus increasing genetic diversity. She sends three adults to accompany them: Wilson, Helen Gray, and the Illegal Jeb. Helen and Jeb, whose children are not allowed on the shuttle due to genetic proximity, resentfully board. Wilson sets them down safely on a lake, and they prepare to settle in their new world. The remaining crew on the Ark plan to survey the 
planetary system
 and beyond until they die.



Pendant stories
[
edit
]


Three pendant stories have been published since, two in 
Asimov's Science Fiction
: ""Earth II"" and ""Earth III."" They were all later published together as ""Landfall: Tales From the Flood/Ark Universe.""

""Earth II"" is set approximately 400 years after the events in 
Ark
 and deals with the struggles of the descendants of the 15 
Ark One
 crew members who choose to settle there rather than continue the journey to Earth III. Since Earth II lacks many of the resources needed to build an advanced society (e.g., oil, coal, uranium, precious metals), its peoples (who have now split into warring nations and 
city states
) have reverted mainly to 
pre-industrial
 technology, primarily reliant on stone, iron, and wood.

""Earth III"" is set approximately 1000 years after the events in 
Ark
 and deals with the struggles of the 
Ark One
 crew members who choose to settle on Earth III. It is revealed that Helen Gray, Wilson Argent, and Jeb Holden fought and killed each other several years after their shuttle landed, forcing the 37 children who went with them to grow up on their own and develop their society. Zane's quasi-religious idea of the world as a simulated reality persists; however, there is a growing movement of disbelievers.

A third tale, ""Earth I,"" followed in a collection called ""Universes"" (also published under the title ""Landfall""); it is set approximately 10,000 years later. It brings characters from several of the now colonised worlds together and reveals the fate of the raft–dwelling survivors on the original, flooded Earth."

In the year 2087, Earth is nearly crime free and the 
artificial intelligence
 
One True
 telepathically controls humans. The main character and first person narrator is forty-nine-year-old Currie Curtis Curran, a retired 
mercenary
 soldier and ""cowboy hunter"". He is recalled from retirement to capture ""Lobo"" Dave Singleton, the last of the ""cowboys"", people beyond the control of One True hiding in the 
Colorado wilderness
.

Currie's contact with One True is through a copy of the 
Resuna
 ""meme"", a ""neurocode"" program 
uploaded
 into the brain, and an implanted ""cellular jack"" radio device.  In addition to communicating with One True, Resuna monitors its host's thoughts and emotions, provides everyday information and communication, 
downloads
 requested memories or skills, adjusts their physiology, and, when offered the spoken code phrase ""let overwrite, let override"", can assume control of its host's body, and erase memories.  Resuna learns its host's preferences and habits, is friendly and communicative, and can even play 
chess
 with its host or engage in other pastimes.

Ten years before, Currie was the leader of a team of cowboy hunters who captured Lobo's cowboy gang after a long pursuit in which several of the team were killed and several, including Currie, badly injured.  During their final confrontation, Currie sees Lobo fall from a high cliff, apparently to his death.  In his briefing by One True, Currie is shown the recorded memories of a mother and daughter beaten, raped, and robbed by Lobo days earlier.  Although such emotions are normally kept in check by Resuna, Currie is allowed to feel revulsion and hatred of Lobo, to improve his performance as a hunter.  One True explains to Currie that, to decrease his chance of being detected and evaded, he has been assigned to hunt Lobo alone.

After goodbyes to his wife of 23 years, Mary, Currie is dropped of by diskster (a futuristic, automatically piloted hovercraft) with various high-tech equipment, including an advanced cold weather suit, shape-adjusting 
ski
/
snowshoes
, and a shelter that self-assembles from collected 
carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen
 matter.

Within days, Currie is captured by Lobo, awakening after many days unconscious from the severe blow to his head that incapacitated him in a comfortable, geothermally-heated underground lair, to discover his copy of Resuna no longer responding to his mental or spoken requests.  Nursed back to health by Lobo/Dave, the two men exchange life stories, which are so similar they joke that they could be brothers.  No longer controlled by Resuna and One True, Currie agrees to join Dave in an effort to hide from One True.

About half of the book consists of Currie and Dave's telling of their personal and the Earth's general history.  Among the details revealed are that the beatings and rapes shown to Currie were fabrications, and that the mother and child are actually Dave's wife and child, who were captured and ""turned"" by One True during the ""Meme Wars"", giving them false memories of their history, from which, during Dave's actual visit to them to obtain medicine and supplies, he was able to temporarily free them.

Currie's search for Dave resulted in enough information being uploaded that they must abandon his lair and attempt to build another, while remaining undetected by One True's network of 
surveillance satellites
.  While caching supplies, Currie has a skiing fall, and, shaken up and angry, reflexively says ""let overwrite, let override"", to find himself immediately calm.  A little later, he realizes that after saying the trigger phrase, he was unconscious and under the control of his Resuna for several minutes, during which time it/he carelessly left a trail visible to satellites, and, he assumes, Resuna uploaded information to One True, though he is still unable to make the usual mental contact with Resuna.  Hurrying to their old lair to warn Dave, he discovers in a previously unexplored room there a 
suspended animation
 device, unmentioned in Dave's story, and beyond anything he could have constructed himself.  Dave informs him that, while he was unconscious, Dave used various means to burn out his cellular jack, assuring that even if his Resuna reactivated, it would be unable to contact One True, and promising to tell him the omitted parts of his story after they have fled to safety.

After abandoning the first lair, while the two work to excavate their new one, Dave tells more of his life story.  As Dave reaches its conclusion, Currie realizes that his disabled Resuna is not due to his head injury, but due to Dave uploading an additional meme, ""Freecyber"".  Although designed during the Meme Wars to disable other memes, principally One True, Dave's story explained that every version of Freecyber had ""mutated"" into as controlling a meme as the ones it was intended to fight.  Enraged, Currie attacks Dave, and is on the verge of killing him when Dave shouts ""let overwrite, let override"", disabling Currie, and flees.

Upon regaining consciousness, Currie finds his Resuna fully functional, though still unable to contact with One True.  He pursues Dave, arriving at the original lair to discover him already captured by a large team of hunters.  Making no effort to fight or hide, Curry joins them, and returns to his home and civilization.

Back in civilization, a cellular jack is installed in Dave's head, but One True is unable to load a functioning Resuna in his brain.  Currie's Resuna is behaving atypically, indicating to he and it that it has become a true, human-like person.  He neither requests nor is compelled to have his burnt-out jack repaired, and demands to be allowed to speak with One True via eyes and ears.   One True speaks with him, explaining that his Resuna is an experimental version designed to interact with Freecyber, and that his mission was planned to result in his capture in order for One True to obtain a ""wild copy"" of the last generation of Freecyber for its research.  As a learning AI, One True explains, it is dissatisfied with its lack of true human empathy and the lack of freedom accorded humans under the present scheme, and seeks to change it, without allowing human society to return to its previous warring, suffering state.

The story closes a few years later, with Dave, his wife Nancy, Currie, and Mary listening to Dave's daughter Kelly give a philosophical speech at her high school graduation, while Currie, his cellular jack repaired, converses with One True about Kelly's speech, the reluctance of many people to replace their old, more controlling version of Resuna with new ones, and the nature of the human experience."

The novel takes the form of an oral history told by a young man named ""Rush that Speaks"" and of his wandering through a strange, 
post-apocalyptic
 world in pursuit of several seemingly incompatible goals. Each of the four divisions of his story are recorded on a separate crystal, and chapters correspond to facets of each crystal.

The story is set in a post-technological future; the present age is dimly remembered in story and legend, but without nostalgia or regret. The people of Rush's world are engaged in living their own lives in their own cultures. Words and artifacts from current time survive into Rush's age, suggesting that it is only a few millennia in the future. Yet there are hints that human society and even human biology are significantly changed. Even such basics as reproduction and eating have been altered, one by industrial-age 
genetic tampering
, the other by contact with 
extraterrestrial life
.

Rush comes of age in Little Belaire, a mazelike village of invisible, shifting boundaries, of secret paths and meandering stories and antique bric-a-brac carefully preserved in carved chests. The inhabitants are divided into clans called ""cords"" based on personality traits. Over the centuries, the people of Little Belaire have perfected an art which they call ""truthful speaking"": communication so clear and accurate, so ""transparent"", as to leave no potential for deception or misunderstanding. Perhaps as a result of this practice, Little Belaire appears to be free of any violence or even serious competition. Another result of truthful speaking is the existence of the ""
saints
"", those whose stories speak not only of the specifics of their own lives, but about the human condition. Yet even with the benefit of truthful speaking, secrets and mysteries
remain.

Rush's journey is set in motion when the girl he loves, Once a Day, elopes from Little Belaire to join another group, an enigmatic society called Dr. Boots's List. In his search for her, Rush befriends a hermit and an ""avvenger"" and shares the secrets of the List. Ultimately he discovers a transparent sainthood stranger than any story told by the gossips of Little Belaire."

The year is 2070. The United Republic of America, under an authoritarian

New Christian Right
 regime constructed after the Second American Revolution, is managed by Liberty Party autocrats. It faces economic sanctions from other powers due to its repressive and xenophobic policies, notably its unilateral establishment of an 
orbiting nuclear weapons delivery system
. The nation has built its first starship: the URSS 
Alabama
. The welcoming celebration for Captain Robert E. Lee takes a sudden turn when Lee initiates his plan to steal the 
Alabama
. Working with a handful of conspirators, Lee manages to alter the computer software and override the clearance codes. URS soldiers storm aboard to stop Lee, but they are too late. Not wishing to abandon their orders, Colonel Reese and the other soldiers become stowaways.

Captain Lee's destination: the 
47 Ursae Majoris
 system, some 46 
light years
 away—far enough to escape the United Republic. At a cruise velocity of .2 
c
, 
Alabama
 would not arrive at its destination until 230 Earth years have passed. The crew of 104 soldiers, scientists, and civilians were put in biostasis, to be awakened from their virtual immortality by the ship's AI 226 years into the future. (Four years are spared due to 
time dilation
.) 47 Ursae Majoris' system has four planets—named Fox, Raven, Bear and Wolf after 
Native American
 mythology. Bear has six satellites—Dog, Hawk, Eagle, Coyote, Snake and Goat. Of these six, Coyote is large enough to support its own 
biosphere
.

Three months into the journey, Leslie Gillis, the senior communications officer, is awakened from biostasis. Expecting the year to be 2300, Gillis is horrified when he questions the AI. Owing to a mixup, it is nowimpossible for Gillis to return to his dreamless sleep. His options are either suicide or a lonely existence. Gillis decides to live. 

After a brief chat with the AI, Gillis learns that Eric Gunther was originally scheduled to awaken three months into the trip. Gunther is an agent for the URA, and was to attempt to contact the president or destroy the ship. The program was changed at the last minute to wake someone else instead—Gillis. Gillis leaves a note for Captain Lee explaining Gunther's plot. Why they were changed at the last minute remains a mystery, but it was a change that would cost Gillis his life.

During his solitary life, he does everything he can to keep from going insane, attempting to eat and sleep at regular hours, reading all of the books available, playing chess against the AI, writing stories, and painting. Using practically all of the ship's art supplies, Gillis creates a story about a prince named Rupurt and the fantastic alien world he lives in. He paints scenes of his books on the walls. Eventually, Gillis dies in his old age after a fall from a ladder while trying to get a better look at an alien ship he has seen. The AI automatically expels his body into space and sails on to 47 Ursae Majoris with no more incidents.

The crew is awakened as planned in the year 2300. The 
Alabama
 has entered the 47 Ursae Majoris system and is approaching its third planet, Bear (currently known as 
47 Ursae Majoris b
) is a 
gas giant
. Coyote, its fourth moon, is larger than Mars and is lush with green plants and rivers of water. This will be the crew's new home. Captain Lee directs the landing procedures of the two ships docked to the 
Alabama
, the 
Wallace
 and the 
Helms
.

The crew finds Coyote to be habitable, but very peculiar nevertheless. Its seasons change at a much slower rate than Earth's. A year for Coyote consists of 1,096 days, with days lasting 27 hours. Lifeforms on Coyote seem similar to those on Earth at first glance, but behave in unique ways. As described in Gillis' novel, the world is home to gigantic bird-like creatures which are anything but friendly. The settlers call them ""boids"", which is Gillis' term for the beasts in his novel. Boids are common in the grasslands around the new settlement.

The remainder of 
Coyote
 follows the adventures of Carlos Montero and Wendy Gunther along the banks of the equatorial river which stretches around Coyote.

Pirius is a fighter pilot stationed at the front. When a battle turns to disaster for the Coalition forces, he disobeys suicide orders to stand and fight, choosing instead to risk survival. In a desperate gamble to outrun a pursuing Xeelee, Pirius captures a Xeelee fighter for the first time in history. Returning to base via FTL travel, he arrives two years previous to the battle, when his younger self is still a cadet. Rather than being lauded as a hero, both instances of Pirius are court-martialed for disobeying orders.

Commissary Nilis of the Office of Technological Archival and Control, part of the Commission for Historical Truth, defends both the older Pirius (whom he calls ""Pirius Blue"") and the younger one (""Pirius Red"") but loses the trial. Pirius Blue is sent to a penal unit at the front as a foot soldier, and Pirius Red is remanded to the custody of Commissary Nilis, who has plans for the fruits of Pirius Blue's battlefield victory. Using the Xeelee fighter and the innovative tactics that saved Pirius Blue, he starts to plan an unheard of assault on the Xeelee's primary stronghold at Chandra itself.

While Nilis and his new team struggle to confront ossified government and military institutions, they try to understand and to develop new and sometimes alien technologies: FTL computers, a 
gravastar
 shield to protect them from FTL foreknowledge, and a 
black hole gun
, capable of disrupting a 
supermassive black hole
's event horizon. Meanwhile, in the course of his new duties to Commissary Nilis, Pirius Red is practically taken on a tour of the 
Solar System
 and some of the Coalition's most scandalous secrets, rife with references to events from previous books in the Xeelee sequence.

As Nilis's project nears completion, it transpires that the Chandra black hole is home to not only the Xeelee, but a host of other organisms, many of which are based on exotic physics and non-baryonic matter. Regardless, the assault on the black hole continues despite protestations from Nilis. After a brutal fight to reach the surface of the black hole, the team commence their assault, causing the Xeelee to abandon it (and the rest of the Milky Way galaxy) to prevent humanity from harming the black hole's inhabitants.

After the assault, the protagonists realise that the Coalition is unlikely to remain intact, now that the war with the Xeelee is no longer present to hold it together. Luru Parz, one of the team, realises that the Xeelee will eventually return, and returns to Earth to ready its defences for when the return happens."

Moon Dawntreader Summer, the Summer Queen of the planet Tiamat, struggles to unite the population under her rule. Moon must convince the Tiamatians to rebuild a technologically advanced society from scratch before the return of the Hegemony in 150 years.

Reede Kullervo is a biotechnologist and a member of a secret society called The Brotherhood. He is also an expert in the Old Empire’s technology, but he has been unable to successfully recreate the water of life. Kullervo befriends BZ Gundhalinu, then betrays him and steals the 
faster than light
 stardrive they created together. Kullervo is kidnapped and enslaved by the Source, a high-level Brotherhood operative.

Gundhalinu returns to Tiamat as the new Chief Justice and head of the Hegemonic government. Kullervo also arrives on Tiamat, where he meets Ariele Dawntreader, Moon’s daughter. He realizes he can speak to the mers. Ariele and Kullervo begin a romantic relationship. Tammis Dawntreader, Moon’s son, becomes a sibyl. He marries a woman while simultaneously struggling to accept his own 
bisexuality
, which is forbidden among the Summer clans. Sparks learns that Ariele and Tammis were actually fathered by Gundhalinu. Betrayed, he joins the Brotherhood. Moon and Gundhalinu reestablish their romantic relationship.

The Source kidnaps Ariele and Kullervo to blackmail Moon. Sparks rejects the Brotherhood and stages a rescue. Gundhalinu attempts to stop the mer hunts and is arrested for treason. Moon discovers the purpose of the mers: they are meant to maintain the sibyl network. Mer hunting has driven them to the brink of 
extinction
, placing the network in danger.

Kullervo learns that he has access to the recorded memories of Vanamoinen, the creator of the sibyl network. The network had orchestrated Vanamoinen’s return in the event that the integrity of the network was ever threatened. Kullervo and Tammis repair the sibyl net, though Tammis is killed in the attempt. Moon is granted knowledge of the coordinates of other Old Empire planets. She offers to share this information with the Hegemony if the mer hunts cease. In her interaction with the network, she loses her sibyl-hood. Gundhalinu is released from prison and restored to his position as Chief Justice. Kullervo and Ariele start a new life together on Tiamat. Sparks leaves Tiamat with Kullervo’s former crew."

Three thousand years before the story starts, Lysos founds a human colony on the isolated planet of Stratos in an effort to radically re-engineer human life into a happier, more pastoral form. She developed a strain of human beings that conceives clones in winter (always female), while those conceived in summer (variants or ""vars"") obtain their genes through sexual reproduction just in case biological adaptation becomes necessary. Further, males and females have opposed seasons of sexual receptivity: men in summer and women in winter.  This scheme is said to be stable over evolutionary time because women gain an advantage from self-cloning, while men only reproduce in summer.  Finally, men have been made far less aggressive during the times that they are less sexually receptive and are much less numerous. The social result is that the vast majority of the population of Stratos consists of groups of female clones, each in its own social or economic niche.  Over the centuries, these groups have come to dominate society.  Men are confined to relatively few professions (such as sailing) and have a lower social status than clones, but higher than vars. In each generation, a few women vars become successful enough to found their own clan or ""hive"" of clones.

As is customary, clones are trained to carry on their clan's business, while vars leave as young adults to seek their fortune. It is time for identical twins Maia and Leie to enter the outside world. They plan to work as sailors to gain experience and explore Stratos, find their niche, and found a clan. Almost immediately, they hit a snag. The only two ship's captains willing to take them on at that time insist they split up, because they cannot have it appear to their clone passengers that clones are doing lowly ship's work. The ships are traveling together. Aboard, Maia meets Naroin, a highly competent female bosun's mate. Later, Leie's ship is lost in a storm. Maia is heartbroken and seriously injured, but eventually recuperates and finds a job on a railroad.

On the railroad, Maia discovers her var temporary assistant is actually a clone courier and courtesan running illegal drugs.  The drugs are designed to shift a man's period of sexual interest.  They are part of a plot by reactionary ""Perkinites"" (named after 
Charlotte Perkins Gilman
, author of 
Herland
) to minimize the role of men in an isolated valley, and perhaps later all of Stratos.

Maia notifies the ""Planetary Equilibrium Authority"", but is kidnapped and imprisoned by the Perkinites.  She discovers that Renna, a prisoner in another cell, is transmitting messages electrically.  She talks with Renna by code and develops a friendship with her unseen fellow inmate. When she discovers that Renna is being transferred somewhere else, Maia engineers her escape, only to find that idealistic radicals (""rads"") and their allies have already freed Renna, who is actually the ""Visitor,"" a 
male
 envoy from the rest of humanity whose arrival has triggered great debate among the leaders of Stratos as to how to respond to the renewed - and unwanted - contact. She tags along with Renna and the rads.

A platonic friendship develops between Renna and Maia.  Their group, which includes Naroin, is later overtaken at sea by pirates (pirating being a tolerated, legal activity). During the ensuing boarding fight, Maia is shocked when she encounters her sister, one of the pirates. The pirates win, with the help of traitors planted in the rads' group. They strand many of their female prisoners, including Maia and Naroin, and one young male sailor named Brod on a deserted island and take Renna, their prize, to a secret base.

After the castaways manage to ambush pirates sent to eliminate all witnesses, they sail off to alert the authorities, but Maia, accompanied only by Brod, sets out to try to rescue Renna.  They inadvertently stumble upon the pirate base. While secretly reconnoitering it, Maia helps free more prisoners, including the rads and the crew of her ship. She also learns that Renna has somehow escaped. More fighting breaks out when their enemies learn the rest of their prisoners are loose. In the turmoil, Maia and her allies are cornered, but she finds a secret exit which leads to the long-lost ""Jellicoe Former"", an advanced manufacturing facility that can produce anything.  Renna is killed when the spaceship he found and completed at Jellicoe Former explodes soon after its launch. Maia is severely injured in the battle. The police and other interested parties arrive to save the survivors of Maia's side.

While recuperating, Maia is dragged into politics and kept a prisoner discreetly by one clan because she has become a symbol. She tells her story to a group of male heads of sailing clans. One of them turns out to be the father she had never known. For her actions, they offer her ""clan"" an alliance. At the end, with Renna dead, Maia becomes an embarrassment to her captors, so she is allowed to walk away free. She decides that she will not found a clan of clones, but rather have offspring the old way."

Wizard
 takes place in 2100, seventy-five years after the events in 
Titan
. Cirocco has become an alcoholic, apparently due to the strain of being the 
Wizard
. Gaby Plauget has taken up the slack, carrying out special projects for Gaea such as building the Circum-Gaea Highway, in return for which she gets some of the benefits Cirocco enjoys, including apparently perpetual youth. Gaea herself is bored, spending her time in the hub with her sycophants and watches old movies.

Gaea provides miracle cures to those who come to her from Earth and prove themselves worthy by doing something ""heroic"" – for example, travel once round the circumference of the great wheel. This provides Gaea with entertainment, as she arranges hazards for them to overcome or die trying; and by providing cures for diseases, Gaea proves her value to humanity so that they do not turn on her and destroy her.

Chris Major and Robin the Nine-Fingered are two pilgrims looking for a cure.  Chris suffers from psychotic episodes which are often accompanied by paranormal ""luck"". Robin is a member of a group of latter day witches living in an 
O'Neill orbital habitat
 who has a strange epilepsy that only manifests in gravity higher than the Moon's. She claims that she bit off one of her fingers to drive away the fits, though it is later revealed she cut it off.

The two meet with Gaea in the hub. She explains the requirement to do something heroic and drops both through a trap door in the hub. They take about an hour to fall to the rim, reaching a high but survivable 
terminal velocity
 in the dense atmosphere. Robin is rescued by one of the Angels who live in the spokes. Chris blacks out during the fall it is implied that his ""luck"" causes him to fall onto one of the blimps that travel around the rim. His next memory is of the Titanide festival.

Robin, Chris, Gaby, Cirocco and four 
Titanides
 set out on a heroic trek.  Gaby and Cirocco have a hidden agenda: they want to canvass the regional brains in order to overthrow Gaea, whom they see as being irretrievably insane.

During the trip, the cause of Cirocco's alcoholism is revealed.  As the price for the discontinuation of the Angel/Titanide War, Gaea has made the 
Titanides
 dependent on Cirocco to have children.  Only her saliva can activate the eggs they produce, so that they can be implanted in a host mother to grow.  The responsibility for an entire race's survival is more than Cirocco can bear; with resignation from her position as Wizard impossible and suicide ruled out by her love for the Titanides, her only release is alcohol-fueled oblivion.

The hazards of the trip include 
buzz-bombs
, living creatures with 
pulsejet
 engines that live high up on the support cables.  They attack living beings, including humans and Titanides, attempting to capture them as food, and present a particular threat to pilgrims with their barbed noses and razor-sharp wings.  Slowly the journey reduces the crew, killing first one of the Titanides and then, in an attack plotted by the crazed crewmember Gene, Gaby, too, is killed. All are separated. Cirocco and her Titanide companion Hornpipe are left on the Rim surface, while Robin and Chris are trapped underground, with the Titanide Valiha, who is not only pregnant but has been badly injured.  Eventually Robin has to climb back to the surface for help and leave Chris to tend Valiha.  She finds herself in one of the Arctic cold zones of the habitat, and almost dies before being rescued.

Cirocco undergoes a complete transformation.  She musters her considerable powers to rescue all the remaining expedition members. Robin and Chris, thinking they have earned their cure but been forsaken, go to confront Gaea, only to be told she has already cured them, and they can get lost. Robin discovers that Gaea has also restored her missing finger.  Cirocco also confronts Gaea, who offers to restore Gaby to life.  Cirocco considers this, but realizes that the result would be a puppet of Gaea.  She shoots and kills the body Gaea has been using to talk to people, then burns it. As Gaea is in reality an intelligence living in the hub itself, the death of this body does not kill her; but it is Cirocco's way of resigning.  Hereinafter, she is no longer the Wizard; she is the 
Demon
.  She escapes by falling through a spoke, to be rescued by her friends the Angels.  Gaea's response is to bombard the rim with the cathedrals that she had been replicating with human help."

The settings are suburban 
Iowa
 and New York City, around the middle of the 21st century. Its first section describes the childhood and adolescence of Daniel Weinreb, an imaginative boy who manages to adapt well to his conservative surroundings until a minor act of rebellion sends him to prison at age 14. Daniel's experience there makes him eager to leave the Midwest. After falling in love with the daughter of a powerful and reactionary local tycoon, he moves with her to New York, dreaming of becoming a musician and exploring the forbidden art of ""flying""—electronically assisted 
astral projection
. Tragedy and exploitation leave Daniel's idealism in ruins, but he persists and becomes an internationally famous and controversial performer.

Alongside this 
Bildungsroman
 storyline, the novel presents a detailed portrait of a future United States torn by economic hardship and 
culture war
. The Midwestern Farm Belt states are ruled by a coalition of the 
Christian right
, known as ""undergoders"" (a reference to the successful conservative campaign to add the words ""under God"" to the 
Pledge of Allegiance
); the nominally secular government is socially repressive and business-friendly to an extreme. The coastal states more closely resemble present-day urban America, with generally permissive social attitudes and artistic ferment, but great economic inequality.

The invention of ""flying"" (which has happened at some unspecified point prior to the beginning of the novel, and is never described in any technological detail) aggravates these cultural divisions. By using a device that seems to be based on 
biofeedback
, while singing with particular verve (an action that, as Disch suggests, causes unique integration of brain activity), a practitioner can separate mind from body and roam the world as an invisible ""fairy"", able to travel almost without restriction and perceive hidden things. The undergoders regard this as a sinful and dangerous practice, so much so that they discourage musical performance of any kind; but in the coastal cities flying is a fad, so popular that singers are afraid to admit not having been able to achieve it. Many Americans simply refuse to believe that such a radical escape is possible and claim that flying is a hallucination, but still take precautions to avoid being observed by ""fairies""."

When a 
jovian-sized
, artificially-created structure enters the galaxy, a society of technologically advanced humans (capable of interstellar flight and functionally immortal) are the first to intercept and investigate it.  Finding it to be an intergalactic ship, they decide to convert it into a cruise ship, inviting alien races to join them in its massive, uncharted interior as it makes a slow circumnavigation of the 
Milky Way
.

After thousands of years, with over 200 billion creatures living in its upper levels, a group of explorers discover a planet hidden in the core of the Great Ship.  As they explore it, however, an 
ionic
 blast cuts them off from the rest of the ship and destroys much of their technology. Because this planet, Marrow, is slowly expanding, the explorers reason that a new bridge can be built in another 5,000 years. They thus begin a civilization on the surface of Marrow.

The descendants of these original explorers come to believe that the large superstructure has been built to contain the Bleak, a race of nearly unstoppable insect-like creatures.  Calling themselves the Wayward, they take over the ship when the bridge is completed and attempt to steer it towards a black hole to destroy the Bleak.

One of the original explorers sees a vision of the Builders of the ship fighting the Bleak, containing them within the heart of Marrow and constructing the ship around it as a prison.  The Bleak, it is concluded, have twisted the Wayward into destroying the ship so that they may escape.  They stop the Wayward's plan by undermining the ship's control and command systems to divert the engines' thrust just enough to skim past the 
black hole
.

The book ends with the suggestion that, with Marrow being a prison for the Bleak and the Great Ship an extension of that prison, the universe itself could be a further layer constructed by the Builders."

The story follows immediately from the final scene of 
Renegades of Pern
, in which the Admin building from Pern's first generation of colonists is discovered, along with an advanced computer called 
AIVAS
 (Artificial Intelligence Voice Address System), at the Landing site that is being excavated. AIVAS has remained undisturbed since the events of 
Dragonsdawn
 some 2500 years earlier and, in addition to holding a huge volume of stored information long since lost to the Pernese society, claims to be able to eliminate the threat of Thread forever.

The Weyrs, led by Lessa and F'lar, enthusiastically embrace this possibility, and with the support of the Holds (led in particular by Jaxom) and the Crafthalls (championed by Masterharper 
Robinton
) proceed to implement the ambitious plan under the careful guidance of AIVAS. Aivas itself had been programmed to speak with a masculine-analogue, inquisitive, somewhat humorous personality, which gave the impression of a light-hearted counsellor to the Pernese, who have no real concept of what artificial intelligence entails.

Over the course of the next four years, Pernese society systematically regains much technology that was lost to the colonists in early attempts to survive Threadfall, including marvels such as electricity, plastics manufacture, heating & cooling, printing presses, and surgery. Although most technological development focuses on the tools and knowledge needed to eliminate the threat of Thread, there are huge developments in the areas of medicine and science, and along the way new Crafthalls are created, including the Print Hall, Paper Hall, Computer Hall, and Dolphin Hall (this last occurs in a parallel story later in the series 
The Dolphins of Pern
).

The phenomenal advancements in technology lead to a kind of culture shock, manifesting in certain traditionalist elements among the Pernese who label AIVAS an ""Abomination"" that is corrupting their society. This dissenting opinion results in attempts to sabotage AIVAS itself and the projects it initiates, culminating in the kidnapping of the beloved Masterharper Robinton in an attempt to ransom his life for the destruction of AIVAS. When the conspirators responsible for the kidnapping are brought to justice, two Lord Holders and a Craftmaster are among those sentenced to exile for the crime.

The Weyrs, Holds, and Halls are successful in carrying out AIVAS's plan to transfer the anti-matter engines from the ships used to colonize Pern to the Red Star, and detonate them. The explosion alters the Red Star's orbit, eliminating the configuration that allowed Thread to land on Pern.

AIVAS earlier reveals to Jaxom that in order for the project to succeed, he must lead the other Dragonriders into using the lesser-known Draconic capability to transfer 
between
 time to deposit two of the three engines 1800 and 600 years in the past. Only the cumulative effect of three interspersed explosions will provide sufficient force to alter the planet's orbit. Jaxom's 
Ruth
, who has an unusually precise ability to know exactly his location in time, is the only Dragon capable of performing this feat.

In parallel to the primary task to alter the Red Star's orbit, a team of medical researchers led by Masterhealers Oldive and Sharra develop an improved parasitic vector which is capable of infecting the space-born Ovoids that are the precursors to Thread. During the course of the three engine-transfer missions, Green Dragons are deployed to seed the surface of the Red Star with these infected Ovoids so that they can be dragged back to infect the Oort Cloud, which is the origin of Thread in the Pernese system. The combination of Jaxom's time travel and this infestation is responsible for the two Long Intervals in the history of Pern wherein Thread failed to appear.

The book concludes with a final conversation between AIVAS and Masterharper Robinton, with AIVAS expressing both satisfaction that its objective of eradicating future Threadfall has been achieved and concern over the possibility that Pernese society could come to idolize the facility as an all-knowing Oracle, thereby stifling further development. To prevent the latter, AIVAS deactivates its artificial intelligence functions, leaving its wealth of knowledge available to the Pernese via computer access, but without the crutch of AIVAS's direct guidance.  Robinton, whose health has declined since the kidnapping, and himself satisfied that Pern has a promising future ahead, passes away in his sleep alongside his fire-lizard Zair."

The novel begins with Dreyfus being sent out on a routine assignment to lock down a glitter-band habitat for polling violations. His superiors send one of his deputies, Thalia Ng, to distribute software upgrades around the Glitter Band to prevent anyone from attempting a similar violation.

In the meantime, Dreyfus is sent to investigate the recent destruction of a habitat named Ruskin-Sartorious. Analysis indicates that the habitat has been destroyed by the flame of a Conjoiner Drive, and Dreyfus's team believe the lighthugger 
Accompaniment of Shadows
, the only one to have been near the habitat in recent weeks, is responsible. Before they can conclude their investigation, however, the 
Ultranauts
 take justice into their own hands and destroy the ship, but not before Dreyfus is able to converse with the captain, who convinces him that his crew were not responsible. Believing him to be truthful, Dreyfus and his deputy, the 
hyperpig
 Sparver, decide to investigate the matter further.

Dreyfus and Sparver interview digital backups of the inhabitants of Ruskin-Sartorious. Dreyfus speaks with one of them about the Clockmaker, an alien machine which formerly lived in a Glitter Band research centre, creating, as its name suggests, clocks, before it began a violent killing spree and was destroyed with nuclear weapons nine years prior to the novel. He and Sparver then analyse communication records from the Ruskin-Sartorious habitat, and discover links with an orbiting asteroid owned by the Nerval-Lermontov family (a member of which was called Aurora). They defeat its defence systems and penetrate inside, discovering a 
Conjoiner
 starship trapped inside. One of them, Clepsydra, has escaped and is hiding. She meets with Dreyfus and tells him that she and the other Conjoiners had been enslaved by Aurora (now an extremely powerful software entity) to use the Exordium to predict the future. The Conjoiners predict a future devastated by what is implied to be the Melding Plague, and Aurora has been planning to respond to stop it (use of the Exordium creates a new timeline which can be changed to avoid the future the Exordium describes). She and Dreyfus escape as a ship under Aurora's control arrives and destroys the habitat.

At the same time, Thalia has distributed the software upgrade to the required four habitats across the Glitter Band, but it appears to be malfunctioning; information access is shut down in the habitats she has visited, and servitors (service robots used across the Glitter Band) are rounding up and exterminating civilians. She and some of the survivors of the last habitat take refuge in its polling core tower, barricading the entrance. Outside, the servitors begin to construct ""
weevil
"" war machines using plans stolen by Gaffney, a Senior Prefect secretly in alliance with Aurora.

Back at Panoply, with Dreyfus in the field and out of communication, Gaffney  manipulates the Senior Prefects into voting Aumonier out of office. Clepsydra is taken into isolation, whilst Dreyfus explains the situation to the Senior Prefects. Unbeknownst to him, however, Gaffney kills Clepsydra and frames Dreyfus. The Prefects debate what to do about the emergence of the weevils, which have now left the four original habitats and are moving towards others.

Before very long, however, Gaffney is exposed as the murderer of Clepsydra when attempting to interrogate Dreyfus. He admits to his role in the weevil outbreak and informs the Prefects that Aurora is responsible. Aurora herself contacts Panoply and demands that they stand down, claiming to be taking over the Glitter Band for its own good. Aumonier, now back in power, refuses and orders Panoply to ready for war. Although Thalia escapes from Aurora's forces during a disastrous attack by Panoply, simulations run by the Prefects indicate that they have virtually no chance of success; the weevils are destroying habitats and converting them into even more weevils, grossly outnumbering the Prefects.

Aumonier speaks to Dreyfus and tells him that the aforementioned Clockmaker was not actually destroyed nine years previously; part of it survived and was recovered by Panoply. The ultra-secret Panoply unit, Firebrand, was established to research it. Although Aumonier ordered it shut down, she now believes its members relocated the Clockmaker to Ruskin-Sartorious. As the Clockmaker was the only intelligence in the Glitter Band capable of defeating Aurora, she attempted to destroy it. Dreyfus confronts members of Firebrand, who confirm Aumonier's theory, but reveal that the Clockmaker was not in fact destroyed; Firebrand became aware of the attack in advance and moved the Clockmaker. Following them to the surface of Yellowstone, he and Sparver fight their way into an abandoned Amerikano colony, where the Clockmaker is being hidden. Sparver leaves to fight Gaffney, who is approaching the colony with bombs to destroy the Clockmaker.

Dreyfus meets with the Clockmaker, who reveals that he is actually Philip Lascaille, a character in 
Revelation Space
 who was believed to have committed suicide after meeting with the 
Shrouders
, but was in fact scanned to produce a simulation, which was sent back to the Shrouders, who turned it into the Clockmaker. Dreyfus tells the Clockmaker what is happening. It incapacitates him and leaves. Regaining consciousness, Dreyfus meets with Sparver. They return to Panoply to find that the weevil attack has collapsed; the Clockmaker has uploaded itself into the Glitter Band's data network and is fighting a digital war with Aurora. As such, she is unable to control the weevils effectively, and the Prefects are destroying them in alliance with the Ultras. Dreyfus begins preparing to investigate the death of Philip Lascaille, having promised the Clockmaker he would bring those responsible to justice."

The book picks up the story immediately after the end of 
The Garden of Rama
. The book follows the story of 
Nicole Wakefield
 and her escape from imprisonment left at the cliffhanger of the previous book.

At this point, the humans had already come into contact with two alien species known as ""octospiders"" and ""myrmicats"". The octospiders were a simple species until a space-faring species made contact with them and forever changed their society. By undergoing genetic enhancements, the octospiders became biological wizards and were eventually able to form a utopia of sorts. The myrmicats (named by Richard Wakefield, a combination of the Greek word for ant, myrmex, due to their ant-like appearance, and the English word ""cat"" due to their feline size and running gait) were a naturally heteromorphic species whose final form was a large, interconnected sentient mesh which was able to directly interface with the human brain through a network of fibers connected to the body; while entering a symbiosis with another sentient ""avian"" species. Through this medium, it was able to communicate to Richard the threat posed to the species by the violent colonists, and at the request of the myrmicats he leaves their habitat carrying some of their eggs for preservation.

As the human colony continues to degenerate with respect to living conditions and human rights, the members of Nicole's family escape to the region nicknamed ""
New York
"", where they used to live in 
Rama II,
 and are eventually reunited with Richard.

Before long, the human colony police come after Nicole's family in ""New York"" and they flee to the octospider city. After the human colony leader starts bombing the octospider city under a made-up pretext and the octospiders retaliate, the situation becomes dire enough that Rama's controlling intelligence intervenes to end the conflict caused by the humans aboard, by sending everybody into hibernation until the end of the journey, except for the surviving myrmicats which are allowed to lead their daily life.

The Rama spacecraft rendezvous with another Node, an enormous 
tetrahedron
 near the star 
Tau Ceti
, designed to research any intelligent life capable of spaceflight. The humans are divided into two groups based mainly on the degree of 
xenophobia
 they had exhibited during the journey. One group will stay at the Node to be studied; the xenophobes are segregated and never allowed to see another alien again. Before her death of old age, Nicole is allowed access to Raman technology unveiling universal insights."

The story is about Julie Katz, the new 
Messiah
, who is the daughter of God, and who is spontaneously conceived from a 
sperm bank
 donation by her father, Murray Katz, through ""inverse 
parthenogenesis
"". Julie struggles with her messianic powers, the mind games of 
Satan
, being hunted by 
fundamentalists
, and the silence of her mother, God.

This novel is a counter-
theodicy
 similar to Morrow's 
Godhead Trilogy
. In addition, 
Only Begotten Daughter
 refers to God as a female throughout the book.

Inverse 
parthenogenesis
 is a baffled scientist's explanation for the existence of an entirely unexpected 
ovum
 in Murray Katz's latest sperm bank donation: unexpected because, as Murray himself admits, he does not know many women. (The ovum, though, apparently, has been provided the necessary 
Immaculate Conception
.)  Murray is a Jewish hermit pushing fifty, living alone in a 
lighthouse
 in 
Atlantic City
, writing a book about human nature based on evidence gleaned from a job at the local Photomat.  His closest friend is 
lesbian
 Georgina Sparks, foster-mother to Julie.

The result of these gathered abnormalities is Julie Katz, half-sister to 
Jesus
.  Well-schooled in the appropriate use of her 
messianic
 powers (she can breathe underwater, restore life to dead animals, and converse with a talking 
sponge
 named Amanda) by her only visible parent (at least as well as Murray can manage), Julie reaches adulthood and explores life, death, Hell and the universe on the East Coast of the modern 
United States
.

She is ten years old when she meets her ""mother's oldest friend"", Mr. Wyvern; the plot thereafter is derived from the intervention of family, fun in the 
Absecon Inlet
, the guiding phantom eye of an enemy, 
Pastor
 Billy Milk, his 
fundamentalist
 sheep roving Atlantic City with juice jugs of milk, and the problems posed by her extra gifts.  The overarching story of the book is that of a satirical 
theodicy
, questioning why human beings suffer from evil and pain, and exploring the ingenuity with which we combat those conditions.

Julie eventually discovers that Amanda, the talking Sponge, is very likely God, and her spiritual (if not physiological) mother. Amanda cares deeply about the planet, but lives at a distance from it, and (because she is only a sponge) is not able to affect the world beyond the occasional miracle."

In 1965, the United States and Canada have been at war with the Soviet Union and the Chinese People's Republic for three years. Both sides' 
atomic weapons
 are ineffective as 
surface-to-air missiles
 shoot down any bombers or guided missiles, so ground forces have done most of the fighting. The Communist nations—whose armies vastly outnumber the North Americans—conquered Western Europe, invaded South America, and are moving toward Texas. All American males must perform agricultural work to feed the armed forces or be 
drafted
 into military, construction, or factory service. Food, electricity, and gasoline are rationed, only two 
CONELRAD
 stations broadcast on radio, and New York City is reportedly under 
martial law
.

Billy Justin, a 37-year-old commercial artist, and 
Korean War
 veteran, is working as a 
dairy farmer
 in Chiunga County, New York, when the radio announces that Soviet and Chinese forces have overrun the Canadian-American line at 
El Paso, Texas
. In 
New Mexico
, the Communist armies capture the 
Los Alamos National Laboratory
 and destroy the incomplete 
Yankee Doodle
, a satellite capable of dropping 
hydrogen bombs
 
from orbit
 that are impossible to shoot down.

The 
President of the United States
 surrenders to the Communists, who over the next several months partition the country at the 
Mississippi River
 and set up a joint 
puppet state
, the North American People's Democratic Republic. Other than a military garrison, disarmament of the civilian population, searches for 
fissionable material
, and establishing production quotas for food, the surrender of the United States leaves Chiunga Center largely untouched. The Soviets execute local 
fifth column
 members who had secretly aided the invasion to prevent them from organizing against the new government but are otherwise relatively peaceful and amenable to the 
black market
.

A 
paraplegic
 comes to Justin's farm asking for work; he is General Hollerith, a veteran of the previous war. He and Justin join a conspiracy to finish the real satellite, a crewed 
space station
 buried in Chiunga County that the United States had been building for 15 years. It requires parts and engineering knowledge to launch. 
MVD
 troops arrive, shoot the corrupt Soviet soldiers, and are much more cruel. To Justin's knowledge, they capture all of the conspirators but himself and the general.

Justin deduces that the contacts he needs to make are in 
Washington, Pennsylvania
. With a traveling preacher, Sparhawk, Justin walks hundreds of miles from Chiunga Center to Washington, benefiting from the Democratic Republic's policy of respecting the Americans' 
freedom of religion
. At Washington, Justin receives instructions from the nationwide 
resistance movement
 for an attack planned for Christmas Eve on Chiunga Center to liberate the satellite.

Despite the Soviets' arrest and torture of a local farmer, they are ignorant of what ""Christmas Eve"", a mild oath they have heard sworn by various citizens, means until the battle begins. Coordinated by Hollerith, bridges around the area are blown up, and nearby arsenals are sabotaged. The townspeople, many of whom are veterans, battle the Soviets as the space station launches.

Hollerith's forces triumph and the Americans transmit an ultimatum to the Soviets and Chinese: The satellite is armed and will destroy Moscow and Peking in 24 hours if occupation forces do not withdraw from American soil and free all prisoners of war. Hollerith offers Justin important positions in the new government and society, but he refuses them and kneels in prayer with Sparhawk, fearing the fulfillment of 
mutual assured destruction

Preamble
[
edit
]


Elkinos Skander is an 
archaeologist
 stationed on the planet of Dalgonia. The planet was formerly occupied by the long-dead Markovian race, who are known only for the planet-sized computers they built into the crust of the planets they inhabited. He leads a group of students studying the ruins. Skander unlocks the mystery of the apparently dead computer. One of the students, patterned (and named) after a brilliant mathematician named Varnett, sees Skander interacting with the computer and confronts him. The two conclude that the computer runs on a form of energy unknown to human physics, forming the basic 
unified field
 that governs the existence of the universe.

The rest of the team discovers a surface anomaly near the north pole of the planet, where a hexagonal ""hole"" appears for a brief interval every day. Skander and Varnett both believe that they will be able to use this anomaly to access the planetary computer, and both set off to attempt to take control. Trying to protect the discovery, Skander stops at the team's camp and murders them. By the time he arrives at the anomaly, Varnett has already prepared for his arrival and the two struggle on the surface. They are swallowed up by the anomaly when it reopens.

Meanwhile, the interstellar freighter 
Stehekin
 is transporting three passengers and grain intended for famine relief. The passengers are a businessman named Datham Hain, his ""niece"" Wu Julee, and a diplomatic courier identified as Vardia Diplo 1261.  During the trip, the ship's captain, Nathan Brazil, discovers that Hain is a ""sponge merchant"", a trafficker in a substance that causes an incurable, degenerative brain disease. Using the threat of withholding the arresting agent, the substance can be used to gain power over those it infects. Hain keeps Wu Julee as an example of what happens in this case; she has regressed to a mental age of five and will eventually be turned into a vegetable and allowed to die.

Brazil diverts the 
Stehekin
 from its course, in an attempt to reach the planet where the alien substance originated to obtain the retardant. Before they arrive, Brazil receives a distress call from Dalgonia and detours to investigate. There, they find the seven students murdered by Skander. Subsequently, the entire party travels to the polar gate, and while they are investigating there, the anomaly reopens and they are transported to the 
Well World
.



Well World
[
edit
]


The Well World is a Markovian construct that stabilizes the equation of our universe. Like Dalgonia, the planet consists largely of an enormous computer that can interact with and control the forces of nature. The surface has been patterned into a series of hexagonal patches where Markovians were allowed to experiment in creating their own new forms of intelligent life, and if they were successful they would be sent off into the universe to evolve on their own. Another Markovian was then allowed to try their hand at species design in the now-empty hex. The planet still contains 1,560 races that were on the Well World when the Markovians disappeared.

At the Well World, Brazil and his companions set off to track down Skander and Varnett, to stop them from gaining access to the central computer and causing harm to the universe. The complication is that travelling through the polar gate on Dalgonia has transformed all of the humans, with the exception of Nathan Brazil, into members of the various species which inhabit the planet.

As the book continues, Brazil comes to realize that his existence is not as it appears, and memories start to surface."

In the early 1980s, a series of ritualistic murders take place in 
Southeast Asia
 in which the victims have their eyes and ears removed, and are each found with a 
playing card
 placed in their mouth bearing the word ""KOKO"". During a reunion of veterans at the 
Vietnam Memorial
 in 
Washington, D.C.
, four survivors of a doomed platoon—Michael Poole (a grief-stricken pediatrician), Tina Pumo (owner of a Vietnamese restaurant), Conor Linklater (an itinerant construction worker) and Harry Beevers (an opportunistic lawyer)—gather to discuss the killings. Because the word ""Koko"" holds special significance to their old platoon, and because the killings recall the events in books he has written, the men believe that the killer is Tim Underhill, another member of their platoon who disappeared years earlier. Beevers convinces the men to help him track down Underhill.

While Pumo remains in 
New York City
, Beevers, Poole and Linklater travel to Asia in search of Underhill. The trio fail to find Underhill in 
Singapore
 but are given several leads which send Poole and Linklater to 
Bangkok
 and Beevers to 
Taipei
. While wandering around a residential area of Bangkok, Poole comes across Underhill at a small neighborhood fair and realizes that he is too stable and good-natured to be the killer. Underhill agrees to return to the U.S. to help in the pursuit. He, Poole and Linklater reunite with Beevers in 
San Francisco
 before returning to New York together. Meanwhile, the killer travels to the U.S. himself and murders Pumo in his apartment. Tina's girlfriend, Maggie Lah, comes across the scene and narrowly escapes the killer's clutches.

The group, now including Maggie, deduce that the killer is Victor Spitalny, a member of the platoon who vanished in Bangkok following the death of another soldier, Manny Dengler, after the war. Poole, Underhill and Maggie travel to 
Milwaukee
 and speak to Spitalny's parents. Learning that he and Dengler went to school together, they speak to several of their old classmates. Poole learns from one of them that Dengler was 
physically
 and 
sexually abused
 by his parents. From this, he realizes that Dengler assumed Spitalny's identity after murdering him and is the killer they are chasing. When the group returns to New York, Underhill is arrested thanks to an anonymous tip to police by Beevers, who wants to capture the killer alone and take all the credit for himself. Underhill is released when Poole shares his findings with the arresting officer.

The group tracks Beevers and Dengler to 
Chinatown
, but split up when they realize the police are trailing them. Poole, Linklater and Underhill find Beevers, who has been captured and bound by Dengler. Dengler smashes a lightbulb, throwing the group into darkness as the police begin to 
negotiate
 for their release. Dengler stabs Poole and Underhill, and takes Underhill's jacket so that he can easily pass for Underhill himself in the dim light. After Poole alerts the police that he is not Underhill, Dengler murders one of the officers and escapes. He flees to 
Honduras
 and is never heard from again. Underhill narrates the end of the story, imagining Dengler's first few days in Honduras and the constant anxiety that would come with them."

The plot begins when an ""angel"", a 
posthuman
 from the Celestial levels at Spearpoint's peak, falls to Neon Heights, further down the spire. The clean-up crew that finds it delivers it to Quillon, one of the zone's pathologists. It is revealed that Quillon was part of a secret angel project to see if angels could be altered to survive in Spearpoint's lower levels. The dying angel tells Quillon that certain factions amongst the angels are searching for him to obtain further information about the results of this project.

Quillon seeks advice from his old ally, Fray, who tells him that he needs to leave Spearpoint if he is to survive in the foreseeable future. He summons Meroka, one of his extraction specialists, to help Quillon out of the city. Quillon and Meroka escape the city, pursued by ""Ghouls""- angels with similar, but less sophisticated, inter-zonal modifications that allow them to survive in lower state zones for short periods of time.

They find out that the zones had rearranged themselves totally overnight in what is called a ""zone storm"". They look to Spearpoint and see that all the lights have gone out, indicating the entire city has been affected by the storm. They venture on and run into an overturned carriage with several bodies having been consumed by the vorgs, carnivorous cyborgs, that harvest brain tissue to feed on. Soon Quillon and Meroka run into a Skullboy caravan and find two prisoners who they release. The Skullboys take them all hostage, then the vorgs turn up and demand fresh meat in return for making drugs for the Skullboys. Meroka offers herself up to the vorgs but before she is harvested the vorg behind her is killed by members from Swarm.

Swarm airmen kill off the remaining Skullboys and Vorg and pronounce Quillons group to be ""clients of Swarm"". They are taken aboard one of the hundred and fifty airships that make up the entity of Swarm. The gang get taken back to Swarm's HQ and are taken to see the leader Riccasso. Meroka finds out that Quillon is an angel and as she had a chequered past with the angels, no longer speaks to him. Ricasso tells Quillon about his research into finding a complete cure for zone sickness, which would allow people to cross zone boundaries at will.

The two prisoners that Quillon and Meroka released are mother Kalis and daughter Nimcha who both bear the Tectomancer birthmark. However Kalis' birthmark upon closer inspection turns out to be a tattoo used to divert hatred and prejudice from her daughter onto herself. Quillon takes great measures to hide their identity from Swarm because they are as prejudiced as all the other outerland peoples about these ""witches"". Eventually Ricasso finds out and agrees to keep it from the rest of Swarm as it would cause unrest with the airmen.

Quillon finds out that the serum that Ricasso had been preparing before serves as an effective anti-zonal medication. Quillon asks Ricasso and a few of his most trusted allies to head back to Spearpoint to help out the millions of needy and sick people still living there. After a tense discussion it is decided that the issue will be put to the flags to see who is for or against the idea. Surprisingly the majority say that they are behind the plans, even some of Ricasso's most staunch enemies. Preparations are made to head out to Spearpoint and the serum is prepared for dilution. When one of the scouts comes back after a successful battle with a Skullboy ship they bring back intelligence and maps that the previously dead land of the Bane has had a zone realignment and using the route could be a massive short cut. Ricasso decides that this is the best plan of action even though it is highly dangerous.

In the vorg cage room where Ricasso's lab is Quillon is hard at work preparing the serum for dilution and he gets surprised by Spatha who has a gun aimed at Quillon's head. Spatha demands that Quillon release a vorg to make everyone think that bringing him aboard and letting him loose in the laboratory was a bad idea. However the vorg runs through the ship and causes mayhem, releases the other vorgs in the cages and manages to kill 4 people before Nimcha uses her powers to cause a small zone tremor so the ship is reverted to a lower state zone, killing off the highly advanced vorg. Spatha is arrested and sentenced to death by 
firing squad
.

The journey across the newly opened short cut over the Bane is uneventful at first, until they come across a metallic object in the distance. The Painted Lady, Curtana's ship on which Quillon and Meroka are living, is instructed to scope out the object whilst the rest of the Swarm carries on its normal course. The object turns out to be a plane, unusual because the Bane is supposedly uninhabitable by anything other than single celled organisms and dirt. Soon they come across more planes, then prop-planes then bi and tri planes until they get to gliders.  Many of them are marked with a red rectangle with one large star and four small stars.  (This means nothing to them, but would be consistent with it being the flag of 
China
 in our own era.)

After this they see on the horizon what appears to be a very similar object to Spearpoint, but with no signs that anyone ever lived on its surface. Ricasso and Quillon elect to take a closer look at the building in a balloon as normal airships can't reach the top of the object. They see that unlike Spearpoint this object was never colonised as thoroughly and is hollow with a hole at the top.

Once they get close to Spearpoint they intercept semaphore lines that tell of zone changes on the boundary of their destination which are so low state it would inhibit powered flight. A plan is made to come in steep, nurse the engines as long as possible and finally glide into Spearpoint. This is complicated by the pockets of resistance put up by Skullboys in balloons. There is a fierce battle into which Quillon and Meroka are enlisted, many of the guns and engines fail as they cross into the lower state zones but eventually they triumph.

They reach Spearpoint and land in the middle of a sea of people. They are met with Tulwar's militia force that escort Quillon and Meroka to the Red Dragon Bathhouse. They start to unload the crates of Serum-15 and a stray Skullboy rocket sets fire to the tail of the Painted Lady. Luckily most of the airmen and Curtana make it off the ship with little more than burns but some of the medicine was lost in the hurry to offload it. At the bathhouse Quillon, Meroka, Kalis, and Nimcha talk to Tulwar about the distribution of the serum and about getting Nimcha close to the Mire, inside of Spearpoint, which has been calling to her through her dreams and asking her to heal it. Tulwar agrees to let them travel to the nearest tunnel entrance and suggests that they stay the night to rest after their chaotic journey. The next day they head to the Pink Peacock and enter the tunnel system with Meroka leading them. She smells something amiss with Tulwar's plan and thinks that they are being set up so that Tulwar can remain in power of Spearpoint and prolong the chaos to reign supreme. She diverts from the planned path and they eventually get caught up by Kargas, Tulwar's head of militia, and get into a fire fight. At that point Fray and Malkin turn up with powerful guns and mow down the assailants. Tulwar had informed the party that Fray was dead but this is just another of his deceptions. After talking to Fray they get lead to meet with the Mad Machines, long thought to be an urban myth about the even more mythical tunnel systems by many living in Spearpoint. They meet with Juggernaught and plead Nimcha's case and it agrees to take them to see the others. They travel along without Meroka and Malkin who leave to sort out Tulwar and meet with The Final One. She informs Nimcha that she must take a place in the chamber beside the other tectomancers so they can heal the Mire.

After the party leaves Nimcha and Fray down in the chamber they decide to take revenge on Tulwar for his deceptions. They hide in crates of the serum and Meroka shoots Tulwar several times, disabling him by puncturing his steam pipes. Quillon talks to Tulwar about his deceptions then spits up blood and passes out. He has internal bleeding from a shot to his back and is on his death bed. He is informed that an angel was sent out to meet with the rest of the Swarm, which had hung back before the zone boundaries, and has told them that they have allies in the celestial levels. Quillon realises that these are the same allies that warned him about his imminent execution and Curtana orders him to travel with Meroka to the Celestial Levels in hopes of saving his life and finding allies to take Spearpoint back from the Skullboys and the unallied angels.

The book finishes with Curtana and Agraffe wondering what changes would befall the planet and Spearpoint after Nimcha has finished healing the mire and wonder what the Mad Machines were talking about when they mentioned Earthgate and going into the planet to reach the stars."

The novel features scenes and events, including the discovery of a nearly-dead alien in the desert, who clearly says in 
English
, ""I'm sorry, but there is bad news,"" and the alien's subsequent 
interrogation
 and 
autopsy
; the discovery of an artificial geological formation and its subsequent nuclear destruction by a desperate military; and the Earth's eventual destruction by the mutual 
annihilation
 of a piece of 
neutronium
 and a piece of 
antineutronium
 dropped into 
Earth's core
.

There is another alien faction at work, however, represented on Earth by small spider-like robots that recruit human agents through some form of 
mind control
. They frantically collect all the human data, biological records, tissue samples, seeds, and 
DNA
 from the 
biosphere
 that they can and evacuate a handful of people from Earth. In outer space, this faction's machines combat and eventually destroy the attackers but not before Earth's fate is sealed. The evacuees eventually settle a newly 
terraformed
 Mars while some form the crew of a Ship of the Law to hunt down the home world of the killers, a quest described in the sequel, 
Anvil of Stars
.

One of the point-of-view characters is Arthur Gordon, a scientist. He, his wife Francine and son Martin are among those rescued from the destruction of Earth. Some other characters are close to an American president, who fails to take action against the threat.

The two books show at least one solution to the 
Fermi paradox

self-replicating machines
 designed to destroy any potential threat to their (possibly long-dead) creators. (A similar theme is explored in

The Festival, a civilisation of 
uploaded minds
, arrives at Rochard's World, an outlying colony of the New Republic. It begins breaking down objects in the system to make technology for its stay. Then it begins making contact with the inhabitants of the planet by dropping cell phones, forbidden to most citizens of the planet, from low orbit.

Those who pick them up hear the Festival, ""Entertain us,"" it asks, ""and we will give you what you want."" Interlocutors who successfully entertain the Festival by telling it something it has not heard are rewarded with anything they wish for. At first they request food or other modest needs, but then Burya Rubenstein, exiled to the colony for his role in leading an uprising, asks for a cornucopia machine in return for a political tract on the disruptive effect a sudden 
singularity
 would have on repressive regimes. Within days the theory becomes reality, as a 
post-scarcity economy
 develops and the government is threatened by Rubenstein's uprising and its advanced weaponry. A naval detachment challenges the Festival but is destroyed.

In the New Republic's capital city of New Prague, 40 light-years away, deep-cover UN agent Rachel Mansour keeps a close eye as the New Republic prepares a military response. Not only does the New Republic misunderstand the Festival, it seriously underestimates its military capabilities. Of greater concern to Rachel is that it may be planning to approach Rochard's World via a 
closed timelike loop
, arriving there shortly after the Festival did, but earlier than the Navy left the capital. If the Eschaton responds to this apparent violation of 
causality
 as the UN fears it might, many settled worlds could have to be evacuated. She recruits Martin Springfield, an Earth-based engineer who has been hired by the New Republic's Admiralty to upgrade its drive systems, to keep an eye out for any signs of such a plan. Unbeknownst to her, Martin is an agent of the Eschaton and has been assigned to sabotage the Admiralty's plan just slightly enough to make it seem unworkable.

Back on Rochard's World, Rubenstein is disappointed with the revolution. While it is successful militarily, the cadres he leads have become as rigid and inflexible as the hegemony they fight against. Late one night, while signing seemingly endless orders and 
communiqués
, he is visited by Sister Stratagems the Seventh, a creature resembling a giant 
mole rat
. She is one of the Critics who accompany the Festival. Normally they remain in orbit providing high-level commentary, but she has gone down to the surface to find out for herself why the inhabitants of Rochard's World seem uninterested in the Festival's wisdom.

Rachel drops her cover and is assigned to the flagship 
Lord Vanek
 as a diplomatic observer. Martin, too, has his contract extended so he can join the fleet on the voyage and finish the job. As the only two Terrans and civilians on board a voyage only they realise will end disastrously, they spend a lot of time together, their relationship deepening into love. The fleet travels a circuitous route, jumping four thousand years into the future, before reaching Rochard's World. Martin's 16-microsecond error in the drive code has worked, slightly delaying the fleet.

Sister Stratagems faults Rubenstein for the shortcomings of the revolution—it was foolish, she explains, for him to rely on revolutionary traditions in the midst of a singularity and its all-encompassing constant radical change. She takes him on a ride, in 
Baba Yaga
's hut, to the northern city of Plotsk, where he might understand. Along the way he sees ""miracles, wonders and abominations"". The landscape in some places has been seriously altered. Many farms and their cybernetically enhanced owners now float freely in 
geodesic spheres
 and 
self-replicating robots
, some dangerous to humans, roam the countryside.

As the 
Lord Vanek
 approaches battle, Vassily Muller, a young 
secret police
 agent assigned to the ship arranges to have Martin arrested as a spy. He and the ship's head of security arrange a fake 
court-martial
 on the capital charge to trap their real target, Rachel, into revealing herself. It backfires when Rachel incapacitates everyone in the courtroom and rescues Martin. Back in her quarters, the two escape on a lifeboat she had her own cornucopia machine fabricate. Vassily and other crewmembers are sucked out into space when they attempt to break in afterwards; he alone survives, wearing emergency protective gear, and is eventually picked up by Rachel and Martin as they descend to Rochard's World, where they arrange, through the Critics, to meet Rubenstein.

The warships confront two Bouncers sent out by the Festival. The fleet's captain suspects a trap, but it seems at first that the New Republic's ships have the upper hand. However, eventually they realise they have been hit with 
grey goo
 and their own ships are being consumed. The senior staff escape. Monitoring the battle from their own lifeboat, Martin and Rachel are unsurprised by the outcome, and explain to an angry Vassily how, despite its lack of intentions, the Festival's visit indeed represented an 
existential threat
 to the Republic since 
information wants to be free
.

At Plotsk, where skyscrapers of 
stratospheric
 height have been erected, Rubenstein and Sister Stratagems meet some of his former comrades, many of them now 
cyborgs
, and realises that the revolution he started has now grown beyond needing him or any other leader. Many of the citizens of Rochard's World have 
transcended their humanity
, joined the Festival or otherwise permanently modified themselves. Rubenstein himself is implanted with a 
brain/computer interface
. When an 
anthropomorphised
 rabbit begs the assembled cadres for help finding his master, the former governor, they join him and Stratagems in looking for him.

They find the governor, who had been granted his wish to once again become a young boy with faithful animal companions, mummified on a hillside where the Festival saved him from zombification at the hand of the Mimes, another associated species, with an 
X-ray laser
 blast that left his body exposed to dangerous levels of 
ionizing radiation
. He asks, via the implant connection, that he be allowed to join the Festival instead of remaining on the planet. As Rubenstein is considering this request, Martin and Rachel arrive. She gives Rubenstein a cornucopia machine, her original mission, which both realise is no longer necessary. Vassily appears and attempts to kill Rubenstein, identifying himself as his son, but Rachel stops him with a 
stun gun
 although he irreversibly damages the cornucopia machine in the process.

The Festival and its associated species leave for their next destination, and on the planet the population—survivors of a thousand years of technological progress compressed into one month—regroup. Those desiring to return to life under the New Republic settle in Novy Petrograd, where the senior officers from the 
Lord Vanek
 have re-established imperial authority. Rubenstein and the others go to Plotsk, where Martin and Rachel run a small shop offering ""access to tools and ideas"" until they can return to Earth nine months later."

Louis Menand
 in

""[T]his is the plot: An 
anarchist
 named Webb Traverse, who employs dynamite as a weapon against the mining and railroad interests out West, is killed by two gunmen, [...] who were hired by the wicked arch-
plutocrat
 Scarsdale Vibe. Traverse's sons [...] set out to avenge their father's murder. [...] Of course, there are a zillion other things going on in 
Against the Day
, but the Traverse-family revenge drama is the only one that resembles a plot [...] that is, in 
Aristotle's
 helpful definition, an action that has a beginning, a middle, and an end. The rest of the novel is shapeless [...]""


As to the multitude of plot dead-ends, pauses and confusing episodes that return to continue much later in the narrative, Menand writes:



""[T]he text exceeds our ability to keep everything in our heads, to take it all in at once. There is too much going on among too many characters in too many places. [...] This [including tone shifts in which Pynchon spoofs various styles of popular literature] was all surely part of the intention, a simulation of the disorienting overload of modern culture.""

The novel is set in the future, on the 
fictional planets
 of Shora and Valedon. Shora is a moon of Valedon, covered by water. The inhabitants of this planet, known as Sharers, are all female. Sharers use 
genetic engineering
 to control the ecology of their planet. They are peaceful beings who ""share"" — that is, they have a spiritual and linguistic union with each other and treat everyone equally. Valedon, by contrast, is one of many planets ruled by a 
transhuman
 figure called ""The Patriarch.""

At the beginning of the novel, the Sharers encounter a non-Sharer community from another planet, which threatens them. The Sharer Merwen the Impatient realizes that they must find out whether other kinds of ""people"" can share their life or not. Merwen goes to Valedon, to recruit a young Valan, Spinel, to return to Shora and attempt to learn their ways. This venture leads to disagreement within the Sharer community, despite the fact that a Valan noblewoman, Lady Berenice, who takes the Sharer name, Nisi the Deceiver, has lived amongst the Sharers before. Berenice, daughter of the first traders to settle on Shora, spent her childhood among the Sharers and returned to Valedon to spend time with her fiancé, Realgar, a Sardish Valan general.

To Spinel's initial distress, after some time on Shora, his skin takes on a purple hue as his body becomes acclimated to the breathmicrobes that allow Sharers to stay longer underwater. He gradually learns the Sharer way, as a man and is finally accepted by Merwen's daughter, Lystra, who risks her life to save him from a Shockwraith, a deadly underwater creature. Lystra's former 'lovesharer', Rilwen, is ""stonesick"", meaning that she has developed an addictive fascination with the stones and gems the Valan traders bring to Shora. After Rilwen's death, Lystra and Spinel become lovesharers.

Realgar and Malachite, an envoy of the Patriarch, visit Shora to place it under Patriarchal rule. After this visit, Realgar, Berenice, and Spinel return to Valedon. Berenice eventually realizes Realgar has no intention of letting her return to Shora and that the Patriarch has arranged for Shora to come under patriarchal rule rather than exist self-governed. She fakes her death and sneaks away to Shora, despite the fact that travel has become forbidden. Meanwhile, Spinel returns to his family, who are living under Dolomite rule after the siege of their city. He helps the citizens stage a peaceful act of rebellion against the Dolomites and becomes a ""spirit caller."" When Spinel hears what has happened to Shora while he has been away, he returns to the capital of Valedon to try and gain passage back to Shora.

Realgar, still grieving the death of Berenice but obeying orders, returns to Shora to force the Sharers to obey Patriarchal rule and Valan law. The Sharers peacefully continue their way of life, despite the increasing military presence and escalating violence of Realgar's soldiers. Realgar has several Sharers kidnapped and probed for information, though the Sharers enter ""whitetrance"", a vulnerable state close to death in which their bodies turn wholly white as their minds retreat within. Some kidnapped Sharers, including Lystra, are taken to Valedon. Spinel sees Lystra and calls out to her, breaking her whitetrance. Spinel's ability to reach the Sharers causes Realgar to take him and the Sharers back to Shora, where the Sharers are tortured. Several of Realgar's soldiers become increasingly sympathetic to the Sharers. Among them is the scientist, Siderite, who is tasked with learning the Sharer's advanced science for the Patriarch and becomes apprenticed to Usha, a ""lifesharer"" who practices advanced medicine.

After finding out Berenice still lives, Realgar  publicly executes several Sharers, and almost executes Merwen before taking her back to the military compound. Merwen attempts to ""share"" with Realgar to cure him of what the Sharers consider the Valan's sickness, the fear that causes them to ""hasten death"" (kill). The Sharers continue to protest through non-violence, though this results in many Sharer deaths. They discover a cure for the microbes the Valans have released to keep away the dangerous seaswallowers and counteract it to allow the seaswallowers to return and bring the planet back into harmony. The return of the seaswallowers nearly destroys the Valan military compounds, forcing the Valan troops to withdraw. Travel between the two planets becomes banned. Berenice remains on Shora, while Spinel almost returns to Valedon to spread nonviolent resistance against the Patriarch. However, when Lystra decides not to follow, Spinel decides to stay as well."

In 1950, twelve-year-old Robert Stephens Jr. lives with his sister Gloria in Gracetown, 
Florida
. Many children in Gracetown are able to sense “
haints
”, an ability they gradually lose with age. The children’s mother has died of cancer. Their father was falsely accused of raping a white woman and has been driven out of town. Robert and Gloria are left in the care of the octogenarian Ms. Lottie.

Robert has a minor scuffle with a white teenager who made advances towards Gloria. Robert is sentenced to six months at the Gracetown School for Boys after a sham trial. The reformatory has a reputation for cruelty; many young men imprisoned there have died in incidents including fires, beatings, and neglect. At the reformatory, Robert sees the ghosts of several young prisoners. Despite this, he is comforted by the spirit of his deceased mother. He befriends Blue and Redbone, two other young inmates. Redbone and Robert are whipped by the sadistic Warden Haddock for discussing escape.

Meanwhile, Gloria and Ms. Lottie hire a lawyer from the 
NAACP
 to appeal Robert’s sentence. In retaliation, the 
KKK
 threatens a majority-Black neighborhood in Gracetown and burns down the Stephens family cabin.

Haddock realizes that Robert can see haints. He asks Robert to help him trap the spirits in exchange for early release. Haddock is concerned that the presence of ghosts will further damage the reformatory’s reputation. Using various hoodoo techniques, Haddock teaches Robert to imprison spirits in the “haint jar”, which is stored in the warden’s office. Haddock orders Robert to catch the ghost of a young man who died in a fire in 1920; Robert realizes that this ghost is his friend Blue. Blue tells Robert that Warden Haddock set the fire that killed Blue and many other boys. They do not want to move to the afterlife until the warden has paid for his crimes. Blue tells Robert that Warden Haddock has pictures of sexual abuse and torture hidden in his desk; he asks Robert to expose the warden.

On visitation day, Gloria and Ms. Lottie pass a plan to Robert: they plan to break him out of the reformatory. Robert plans to escape with Redbone. However, the warden locks up Redbone to punish Robert for failing to catch enough haints. Redbone is then killed by an older boy.

On the day of the escape, Blue sets fire to the kitchens as a distraction. Robert breaks into Haddock’s office, stealing the haint jar and the incriminating photographs. Haddock soon realizes what Robert has done and pursues him. Robert releases the ashes into a creek, freeing the trapped spirits. Blue and the other spirits released from the jar kill Haddock by turning his own hunting dog against him. Robert and Gloria escape to Chicago, where they reunite with their father."

President Helen Lasker meets with Ellie to discuss first contact. Ellie begins a relationship with Presidential Science Advisor Ken der Heer. With Soviet colleague Vaygay Lunacharsky, she ensures continuous monitoring of the signal. A third message contains plans for an advanced machine, but decoding its 30,000 pages proves impossible without a missing 
primer
.

At the President’s insistence, Ellie meets religious leaders Billy Jo Rankin and Palmer Joss. A 
skeptic
, she demonstrates her faith in science by trusting a 
Foucault pendulum
. Dismissing Rankin’s views, she finds Joss’s perspective intriguing. In Paris, experts confirm the Machine is a five-seat 
dodecahedron
. There, Ellie meets Devi Sukhavati, a doctor who lost her husband after leaving India for love. The final message piece is found when billionaire S. R. Hadden suggests checking for 
phase modulation
, revealing the primer.

A U.S.-Soviet race to build the Machine ensues, but Soviet design flaws leave the American version as the only option. Ellie applies as a passenger but loses her spot to Drumlin. Extremists plant a bomb in the Wyoming facility, which detonates during testing, killing Drumlin and delaying the project indefinitely. Meanwhile, Ellie’s mother suffers a stroke, leaving her paralyzed. Staughton accuses Ellie of neglecting her family.

Ellie later learns Hadden has moved to a private space station. There, he reveals his company has secretly built a third Machine in 
Hokkaido
, Japan, set for launch on December 31, 1999. Ellie, Vaygay, and Devi secure seats, joined by Nigerian physicist Abonnema Eda and Chinese archaeologist Xi Qiaomu. Before departure, Joss gives Ellie a medallion, which she takes aboard.

The activated Machine transports the group through

Cygnus A
. The wormhole network was built by unknown precursors, and hidden messages exist in transcendental numbers like pi. Reunited, the travelers record evidence before the dodecahedron returns them to Earth.

Back home, their journey—seeming more than a day—took no time at all on Earth. Their video recordings are erased, likely by wormhole magnetic fields. With Hadden seemingly dead and the transmission halted, officials suspect a hoax. Pressured, the travelers stay silent, though Joss believes Ellie, who now relies on faith. The novel later reveals Hadden faked his death, secretly launching himself into space using

Miles Vorkosigan
 graduates from the Academy, but is upset to learn he is being sent to replace the weather officer at the Empire's winter infantry training base on remote Kyril Island. He is somewhat mollified by the placement officer's explanation that the posting is to see if he can handle the discipline and military routine. If he can, he will be reassigned to a more desirable posting. However, he cannot help but get into trouble.

Miles refuses to obey what he deems a criminal order by the base commander, who has him arrested for mutiny, and as he is high Vor, technically treason. He is quickly returned to the capital and sequestered in the bowels of Imperial Security (ImpSec) by Simon Illyan, who, along with his father, concludes that Miles had behaved correctly, but has also gained notoriety for his insubordinate action and cannot expect to serve in any branch of the Imperial Service, with one possible exception. Miles' father, Aral Vorkosigan, persuades Illyan to transfer Miles to ImpSec, despite Illyan's and Miles' reluctance.

Miles, sent to help evaluate the Hegen Hub (and remain conveniently out of the way). There, under his cover identity of an arms dealer, he is framed for murder and arrested. While in custody, he is startled to find Emperor Gregor in the same cell. Gregor tells him that he ran away during a visit to Komarr and joined a merchant ship's crew as a navigator, but was then left behind without pay at Consortium Station and jailed for vagrancy. Miles attempts to extricate Gregor, but is soon up to his neck in a mysterious plot involving an amoral femme fatale, his homicidal former Kyril Island commanding officer, and Hub power politics. Miles encounters his Dendarii mercenary friends and, after once again outmaneuvering their leader, Admiral Oser, resumes command under his Admiral Naismith persona. He is able to rescue Gregor from the femme fatale (an extremely devious, short mercenary leader herself) and get the mutually suspicious Hegen Hub planets to present a united defense to repel a surprise attack by a Cetagandan invasion fleet, with timely help from Barrayaran reinforcements jointly commanded by his father and Gregor.

Afterward, Gregor and ImpSec decide to put the Dendarii on permanent secret retainer for covert missions, with Miles officially installed as liaison."

The story is written from two viewpoints, equidistant from the novel's publication in 1980.  The first thread is set in a 1998 ravaged by ecological disasters such as 
algal blooms
 and 
diebacks
 on the brink of large scale 
extinctions
. Various other events are mentioned in passing, such as student riots and an event of 
nuclear terrorism
 against New York City that took place before the events of the novel. This thread follows a group of scientists in the United Kingdom connected with the University of Cambridge and their attempts to warn the past of the impending disaster by sending 
tachyon
-induced messages to the astronomical position the 
Earth
 occupied in 1962–1963. Given the 
faster-than-light
 nature of the tachyon, these messages will effectively reach the past. These efforts are led by John Renfrew, an Englishman, and Gregory Markham, an American most likely modeled on Benford himself.
[
1
]


The second thread is set at the 
University of California, San Diego
 (UCSD), in 
La Jolla, California
 in 1962, where a young scientist, Gordon Bernstein, discovers anomalous noise in a physics experiment relating to spontaneous resonance and 
indium antimonide
. He and his student assistant, Albert Cooper (also likely based on the author and his experiences at UCSD), discover that the noise is coming in bursts timed to form 
Morse code
.

The resulting message is made of staccato sentence fragments and jumbled letters, due to the 1998 team's efforts to avoid a 
grandfather paradox
. Their aim is to give the past researchers enough information to start efforts on solving the pending ecological crisis, but not enough that the crisis will be entirely solved (thus making a signal to the past unnecessary and creating a paradox).
Due to the biological nature of the message, Professor Bernstein shares the message with a professor of biology, Michael Ramsey. Since the message also gives astronomical coordinates, he also shares it with Saul Shriffer, a fictional scientist who is said to have worked with 
Frank Drake
 on 
Project Ozma
. Initially, these characters fail to understand the true meaning of the message. Ramsey believes it to be an intercepted military dispatch hinting at Soviet bioterrorism, while Shriffer thinks the message is of extraterrestrial origin. Shriffer goes public with this theory, mentioning Bernstein in his findings. However, Bernstein's overseer, Isaac Lakin, is skeptical of the messages and wants Bernstein to keep working on his original project and ignore the signal. As a result of this interruption in their experimentation, Bernstein is denied a promotion and Cooper fails a candidacy examination. The signal also exacerbates difficulties in Bernstein's relationship with his girlfriend, Penny.

In 1998, Ian Peterson recovers a safe deposit box in La Jolla containing a piece of paper indicating that the messages were received. Meanwhile, it is clear that the viral nature of the algal bloom is spreading it faster and through more media than originally expected. Strange yellow clouds that have been appearing are said to be a result of the viral material being absorbed through the 
water cycle
, and it soon affects the planet's agriculture as well, resulting in widespread cases of 
food poisoning
. Flying to the United States, Markham is killed in a plane crash when the pilots fly too close to one of the clouds and experience seizures.

In the past storyline, now advanced into 1963, Bernstein refuses to give up on the signals. He is rewarded when the 
signal noise
 is also observed in a laboratory at 
Columbia University
 (a nod towards the inventor of the tachyon concept, 
Gerald Feinberg
 of Columbia). Using hints in the message, Ramsey replicates the conditions of the bloom in a controlled experiment and realizes the danger it represents. Bernstein finds out that the astronomical coordinates given in the message represent where the Earth will be in 1998 due to the 
solar apex
. He also receives a more coherent, despairing message from the future. Having built a solid case, Bernstein goes public and publishes his results.

This decision has monumental consequences. On November 22, a high school student in 
Dallas
 is sent by his physics teacher to the 
Texas School Book Depository
 to get a copy of Bernstein's findings. There he interrupts 
Lee Harvey Oswald
's assassination attempt on President 
John F. Kennedy
, attacking the shooter and sending the would-be fatal third shot awry. Though seriously injured, Kennedy survives. This paradox creates an alternate universe and forever ends the contact with the original 1998.

The concluding chapters portray the 1998 of the original timeline as a bleak, failing world, the intensified ecological disaster taking a noticeable toll on the human way of life. Peterson retreats to a fortified country farmhouse which he has obviously prepared well in advance. Renfrew continues to send out signals (including the more coherent one that Gordon receives) until the building's generator gives out. Before it does, however, he receives a signal purportedly from the year 2349.

In the final chapter, set in the alternate 1974, an awards ceremony is held for achievement in science. In light of Kennedy's survival, the United States President giving out the awards is 
William Scranton
, who is said to have defeated 
Bobby Kennedy
 due to a 
telephone tapping
 scandal. The scientists whose work stemmed from the signal are honored, including Bernstein, who receives the Enrico Fermi Prize for his discovery of the tachyon.

In 
1718
, French puppeteer John Chandagnac sails to 
Jamaica
 on the British ship 
Vociferous Carmichael
. He aims to confront his uncle Sebastian, who has apparently stolen a fortune that rightfully belonged to John's father and could have prevented his poverty-induced death. On board, he meets an Englishwoman named Elizabeth Hurwood, who complains that her erudite father Benjamin has abandoned his 
natural philosophy
 work and begun studying dark magic with her lecherous 
physician
 Leo Friend. The pirate sloop 
Jenny
 menaces the 
Carmichael
, neutralizing its powerful cannons with vodun magic. Benjamin Hurwood and Friend begin shooting their fellow passengers, revealing them as allies of the pirates, as the assailants board and seize the 
Carmichael
.

The pirates allow the passengers to leave on a rowboat, except for Beth, whom Hurwood requires for a vodun ritual, and Chandagnac, enrolled into the crew after wounding pirate captain Philip Davies. Not fond of long words, the pirates change John's name to Jack Shandy. The pirates head for 
New Providence Island
 to refit the 
Carmichael
 for piracy. On the way, they are captured by the 
Royal Navy
, but Shandy breaks them out, thus ingratiating himself with the pirates. On New Providence, Shandy develops a proficiency for cooking and learns about vodun: unlike in the Old World, magic is very strong in the Caribbean, and pirates hire 
bocors
 to channel 
loas
 for healing, attacking and protection. Male and female sorcerers control different kinds of magic. Shandy also meets a rambling old sorcerer named Sawney, and develops an affection for Beth.

Hurwood has concluded an alliance with Blackbeard to lead him to the fabled 
Fountain of Youth
 in 
Florida
, a powerful source of magic that will make Blackbeard immortal and allow Hurwood to resurrect his late wife—a process which involves evicting Beth's soul from her body. Davies and Shandy join him, fighting through a hostile, 
sentient
 jungle on the way. Davies defends himself from a curse by tossing enchanted soil into the air; Shandy takes note and saves some soil for himself. Shortly after he returns from the Fountain, Shandy finds that Friend has seized the 
Carmichael
 and abducted Beth. He gives pursuit in the 
Jenny
, and fights off Friend's magical 
zombie
 crew, with assistance from the 
ghost ship
 
Nuestra Señora de Lagrimas
, which Friend accidentally summoned along with the ghost crew. Davies is killed and Hurwood takes Beth for himself after defeating Friend in a wizards' duel.

Not knowing where to find Beth, Shandy becomes a drunken wreck and accepts the King's pardon from Woodes Rogers, along with most of the pirates on New Providence, while Hurwood assumes a new identity as Ulysse Segundo and begins pirating. Meanwhile, Blackbeard is killed by the Navy, and Shandy receives an education in magic from old Sawney (actually a 200-year-old 
Juan Ponce de León
) and a vision he gets after using the Fountain of Youth soil during a fight. A survivor of Segundo's raids relates the mannerisms of his undead crew, and Shandy recognizes them as the old 
Carmichael
 crew. Hearing that Segundo was last seen heading for Jamaica, Shandy sails on the 
Jenny
, facing a storm and a 
mutiny
 on the way.

Using Sawney's cryptic tips—involving blood and the magic-dampening power of magnetized 
iron
—he defeats Hurwood and destroys his wife's soul. In Jamaica, he barely escapes the Navy and fights his way to the house of Hurwood's accomplice, who turns out to be Sebastian. He frees Beth and makes his way to a harbor, where he is met by Blackbeard, now resurrected and assuming a new identity. Combining his male magic with Beth's female magic, he vanquishes Blackbeard and marries Beth. The book ends as he prepares for the voyage out of Jamaica."

On May 20, 1996, an

 explodes, killing the wife and children of molecular biologist John Roe O'Neill. Driven halfway insane by his loss, his mind fragments into several personalities that carry out his plan for him. O'Neill plans a

Ireland
 (for supporting the IRA), 
England
 (for their actions in Ireland and giving the IRA a cause), and 
Libya
 (for training said terrorists); he demands that the governments of the world send all citizens of those countries back to their countries, and that they quarantine those countries and let the plague run its course, so they will lose what he has lost; if they do not, he has more plagues to release.

After releasing the plague, O'Neill goes to Ireland to hide, planning to offer his services as a molecular biologist in the hopes of sabotaging whatever work is done there on finding a cure. When he arrives in Ireland, investigatory agencies suspect his true identity as the instigator of the plague. To travel to the lab at 
Killaloe
, he is forced to walk with a priest, a boy who has taken a vow of silence due to the death of his mother, and Joseph Herity, the IRA bomber who detonated the explosive that killed O'Neill's wife and children; their purpose is to confirm his identity, either through Herity's indirect questioning, or the possibility that he will confess to the priest when confronted with the pain his revenge has caused for the boy.

Meanwhile, law and order have broken down in England and Ireland, and the old Irish ways are coming back.  Local IRA thugs appoint themselves ""kings of old"", and others recreate 
ancient Celtic religions
 centered on the 
rowan

Captain Pausert is a well-intentioned but inexperienced merchant traveler from the planet Nikkeldepain, voyaging solo on the old pirate chaser 
Venture
. While on the planet Porlumma, the captain is moved by sympathy to purchase three young sisters – Maleen (about 14 years old), Goth (9 or 10), and the Leewit (5 or 6) – who had been enslaved while visiting another planet on a jaunt of their own. In getting clear of Porlumma, the 
Venture
 escapes pursuit when the girls desperately use what they call the Sheewash Drive, which enables far faster transit than is possible with primary or secondary space drives available either in or outside the Empire. The girls reveal that they are witches from the planet Karres, with klatha (
psionic
) powers. The girls' powers, but especially the possibility of this incredibly fast drive, draw the unwelcome attention of planets and ships they pass. After taking the three sisters to their homeworld of Karres, the captain attempts to return to his home planet but is stunned when faced with a barrage of criminal charges, many relating to his encounter with the witches and his brief stay on the prohibited planet of Karres; in addition, the planetary government avidly want the suspected new space drive. Captain Pausert escapes the Nikkeldepain police and military with the help of the middle sister, Goth, who had 
stowed away
 on the ship.

The two head for the planet Uldune, formerly a pirate stronghold but now a place to buy anything, where they rebuild the ship and assume new identities in preparation for starting a trading business. The captain also finds himself developing minor klatha powers. The pair run afoul of both the planetary government and the Imperium, including industrial espionage and even kidnapping. Finally the newly renamed 
Evening Bird
 lifts off for the planet Emris via a shorter but far more dangerous route through an area of space called the Chaladoor. Aboard are the captain, Goth, a hired ship-hand named Vezzarn, two paying passengers, the passengers' cargo, and a mystery: the ruler of Uldune, believing that the captain and the girl are both witches, asks them to also transport a frightening rocky mass and the catatonic witch found with it.

All is not as it seems aboard the 
Evening Bird
. Vezzarn and one of the passengers, Hulik do Eldel, are spying and creeping around the ship in an attempt to locate the Drive. Vezzarn, however, uncovers the mystery mass, thereby attracting ominous yellow tendrils of insanity called Worm Weather. The captain is having increasingly odd interactions with an immensely powerful alien presence called a vatch, which seems to be manipulating events and watching with glee. Then the second passenger, Laes Yango, drugs everyone on board and redirects the ship for his purposes: he is actually the leader of a feared fleet of space pirates in the Chaladoor, and he is also after the Sheewash Drive. When the Worm Weather attacks, the vatch decides to interfere and they are able to land the ship on a seemingly deserted red planet. The captain, Goth, Vezzarn, and Hulik defeat Yango and his murderous giant spider-robot before taking off once again for space.

The vatch is delighted in the captain's cleverness, and sends him on the next leg of what it calls a game. As a ghost-like projection, the captain is sent to talk to Cheel, the leader-in-hiding of an enormous interdimensional space ship that has been taken over by its insane computer. The captain learns that the computer wants to conquer all known space, using the Worms as its advance guard, and their only salvation is that mystery mass. The group is reunited when the vatch transports them all to Karres, but 50,000 years in the past. The captain continues to refine his klatha powers, including how to grab and manipulate small amounts of the vatch's black energy. When the Leewit shows up – thrown through space and time by the vatch – Goth and the captain learn that the witches of Karres have attacked the Worm World. The two girls and the captain are transported by the vatch to the mad computer's temple/throne room. There they use their witch powers to destroy the computer and its machine minions. Cheel then emerges to retake the Worm World space ship using the mystery mass, but he has no intention of returning to his home dimension and instead proclaims his intent to conquer all. The vatch is elated by the trick, until the captain hooks and manipulates its energy in order to send the former Worm World back to its own dimension, send himself and the witches back to his ship, and send the ship to its rightful time and place. They arrive on the planet Emris in time to rejoice about the victory with the young witches' parents.

Testing shows that the captain does indeed possess klatha powers: two rare talents for now, with a strong overall capacity for future development. The witches' father recruits the captain as a special 
courier
 for the Empress, with the understanding that Goth accompany him because the witches have 
foreseen it
. The captain and Goth are only hours into their first courier mission when Vezzarn and Hulik enter the control room, admitting that they stowed away and asking to join his crew. When the Leewit suddenly appears – once again thrown through space but by an unknown force this time – the captain can only mutter, ""here we go again!""

, the submarine she has been kept on.

She spends two years in the prison. When a South African country supported by European authority of the Vienna convention attacks Mali, she is taken in a convoy to the atomic site to be shot on camera as a hostage. She is miraculously freed when the convoy is attacked by a group of Inadin Cultural Revolutionists. Their leader is Jonathan Gresham, an American journalist and radical, who helps Inadin people (also called

Lawrence’s doctrine
[
edit
]


In the fictional world of 
Islands
 there exists a book titled 
The Lawrence Doctrine and Postindustrial Insurgency
 by Colonel Jonathan Gresham. It is banned by Vienna and widely read in the political underground. It draws on the example of 
T. E. Lawrence
, who during the First World War helped the Arabs, who were 
fighting the Ottoman Turks
. Lawrence convinced them, instead, to block the Ottomans' expansion by destroying their communication lines, which at the time were railway tracks and 
telegraphs
. Although the Arabs were successful in fighting the Turks, they became dependent on the 
British Empire
 to provide them with industrial products such as explosives and canned food. Gresham calls the First World War “a proto-Net civil war”. In Sterling's 21st century, the Tuaregs' enemy is the Net. But whereas the Arabs were colonized by the British with industrial products such as guns, cotton, dynamite, and canned food, for Sterling's Tuaregs the necessary products of the Networld are solar power, plastique, and single-cell protein.

Gresham’s book shows a pessimistic view of 
globalization
 and its mechanisms. It takes the view that it is impossible for small and economically weaker nations to stay completely independent; global influence will always be present with its positive and negative aspects.



Political order of the world in 
Islands

]


In the world of the novel the USA and 
the Soviet Union
 are still the world powers. The international political order, which is guarded by the Vienna Convention and uses 
censorship
 as a means of keeping the world order, is weak and divided, and to avoid world panic protects the terrorists from F.A.C.T. Countries that grow in power are Grenada, Singapore and Luxembourg, the so-called data havens where data piracy is legitimate. Organizations that feel threatened by the growing influence of havens are Rizome Industries Group, an economic 
democracy
 global corporation which suffers losses because of the data piracy and wants to negotiate with the pirates, and the Free Army of Counter-Terrorism (F.A.C.T.) which calls itself “the 
real
 world police” and plans to deal with any signs of attacks on “doctrines of national sovereignty”. This is the main reason why F.A.C.T. assassinates Winston Stubbs and bombs the ship on which Laura was sailing with Singaporean pirates.

The novel shows a new phenomenon emerging in the political world. The global organizations start realizing that they no longer need governments to successfully run their affairs; “Let us cut out the middleman,” says a worker for another corporation. The F.A.C.T. seems to be fighting signs of such thinking, while at the same time it is itself a global corporation which took over the government of Mali in order to have its own military base.
Africa is still “a mess”. The only problem which has been solved is famine, thanks to ""the scop"", a single-cell protein. The countries still suffer from poverty and political instability. People die from 
retroviruses
 and have no perspectives, and developed countries are not interested in what is going on there."

Jilly is struck by a car and becomes paralyzed on her right side. She discovers she can dream herself to the spirit world like her friend Sophie has long known how to do. Her physical body remains in the hospital bed while a dream version of herself, young and not paralyzed, traverses the spirit world. There she meets her friend Joe Crazy Dog, who can travel to the spirit world while awake. He tells her he has sent for a pair of ""crow"" girls who might be able to cure her condition, but only after she deals with emotional wounds from her past.

Somebody breaks into Jilly's studio and destroys many of her paintings. Her friends keep seeing on the streets a woman who looks just like Jilly. They wonder if a 
shadow twin
 might be behind both Jilly's ""accident"" and the vandalism.

Jilly meets in the dreamlands a young man named Toby. He is an 
Eadar
 – a fictional character who acquires a physical presence in the spirit world, but whose existence depends on there being people who believe in him. Together they spend several nights climbing a huge tree to get some magical twigs that may help both of them.

In flashbacks, the book gradually reveals details of Jilly's past. As a child, she was repeatedly raped by her brother Del. She finally ran away from home and by her teens was a junkie and prostitute living on the streets, until a kind cop named Lou found her and brought her to his then girlfriend Angelina, who rehabilitated her.

Back at Jilly's former home, Del turned his attention to her younger sister Raylene, who never forgave Jilly for abandoning her. Raylene slashed Del's leg, and later ran away with her best friend Pinky. To make money, they performed 
badger games
 and ended up killing a dirty cop. Pinky eventually became a porn star, while Raylene started working in a print shop. There she fell in love with one of her coworkers, who taught her how to use computers, but was killed by a robber. Pinky served several years in prison for assault, and during that time she and Raylene began sharing dreams in which they were wolves hunting unicorns.

Raylene learned her sister's whereabouts from an article. On the day of Pinky's release, Raylene bought a pink 
Cadillac
 and the two of them rode off in search of Jilly. That is when Raylene destroyed Jilly's paintings, and continued to stalk her.

In the hospital, Jilly and Sophie discover that they can share their dreams as well, and when they find themselves in a forest, they encounter a pack of wolves, one of whom reminds Jilly of her sister. She realizes that Raylene must be the lookalike who destroyed her paintings.

Raylene is upset that Jilly has now invaded her dreams. She wants to find a way into the dreamlands while awake, so that she can avenge herself on Jilly there. She sees Joe on the street and recognizes him from his 
Don't! Buy! Thai!
 
T-shirt
 as he slips into the spirit world. By watching him, she figures out how to enter the spirit world herself. She and Pinky kidnap the sleeping Jilly and carry her body into the spirit world.

The dreaming version of Jilly has reached the top of the tree and retrieved two twigs, one of which made Toby real, and no longer an Eadar. The other had no effect on Jilly's condition. But because Jilly's physical body has entered the dreamlands, she feels pulled toward it, and she must climb down the tree to reach it.

When she reaches Raylene, they begin talking. Raylene realizes how silly it is to hold a grudge against her sister for something she did when she was a kid just trying to survive. Unfettered, Pinky points her gun at Jilly and fires – but Raylene places herself in the line of fire and dies. Joe arrives at that moment with a pitbull, which kills Pinky.

Toby reaches the clearing with the remaining twig woven into a wreath containing additional herbs, which is powerful enough to cure Jilly's paralysis. Instead, Jilly uses it to bring Raylene back to life. Because Raylene killed many unicorns, she must never return to the dreamlands, or else Joe's friends will hunt her down. The crow girls visit Jilly and tell her that they cannot yet cure her condition, but they give her feathers so that she can call them anytime she wants."

At the end of 
The Mote in God's Eye
, Renner and Bury are secretly enlisted into Imperial Naval Intelligence. Neither is happy about the arrangement at first, but they spend the next twenty-five years effectively preventing rebellions against the Empire so that the Imperial Navy can concentrate on blockading the Moties in their star system.

While investigating suspicious economic activity on the planet Maxroy's Purchase, Renner and Bury encounter wide idiomatic usage of the phrase ""...on the gripping hand"". The source of the phrase turns out to be innocuous enough — the governor picked up the expression as a crewman on INSS 
MacArthur
 on the expedition to Mote Prime — but the memories dredged up are too much for Bury. Driven by nightmares and a deep-seated fear for humanity's safety, Bury must confirm that the Empire is safe from the Moties. Renner and Bury travel to Sparta, the Imperial capital planet, to obtain permission to inspect the blockade.

In 
Mote
, it is mentioned that a 
protostar
 is forming in the 
Coalsack Nebula
. The Moties had studied it extensively and fooled Jacob Buckman, the astrophysicist on the only expedition to the Motie system, into believing that it would ignite in about 1,000 years. Bury and Renner discover, much to their horror, that the object is due to collapse and ignite much sooner. The newborn star will create one or more new 
Alderson Points
 for interstellar travel, giving the Moties another usable exit from their system. The sole currently existing Alderson Point leads to inside the 
photosphere
 of the supergiant red star Murcheson's Eye, which made the blockade much more practical.

Armed with this alarming knowledge and carrying influential passengers, Renner and Bury depart aboard Bury's ship 
Sinbad
 for New Caledonia, the closest human system to the Mote. There the Imperial Commission decides that ships must be sent to the hitherto ignored star system where the only dangerous Alderson Point will appear. All that can be sent on such short notice are two Imperial warships and 
Sinbad
.

They arrive — just in time to observe seven unarmed Motie ships emerge from the new Alderson Point. The Moties scatter, and three human ships cannot possibly capture all of them, though they can block the exit. Renner and Bury decide they have no choice but to accept a Mediator's invitation to return with her to the Motie system.

The second half of 
The Gripping Hand
 is a tale of shifting alliances involving many Motie factions, diplomacy and space combat. With the aid of the grownup offspring of Lord and Lady Blaine, raised in the company of Mediators brought back by the first expedition, Bury and Renner fight to save the Empire.  Key to their strategy is a 
genetically altered
 parasite developed by the Blaines' research institute. It limits the excessive reproduction rate that has condemned the Moties to Cycles of overpopulation, followed inevitably by war and the collapse of civilization. Two alliances coalesce, one in favor of peaceful co-existence with humans and another determined to escape the Motie system at any cost. The pro-human faction wins."

The protagonist, Larry Dever, is gravely injured resulting in a radical surgical procedure, a 
hemicorporectomy
, in which tissue below the waist is removed. He is outfitted with a set of intelligent mechanical legs, a ""manniquin"", and is placed into suspended animation until the damaged tissue can be restored. He wakes at a time when cloning technology can replace his legs, although for a price. Years before he was awakened, a clone, or ""bud child"", was created and is now a thriving young boy without language. Horrified by the prospect of his child being sacrificed to provide him with a new lower body, Larry opts to return to suspended animation. His child, Dim Dever, is selected by the guiding world computer, called Olga, to carry his ancient genes to a possible new colony on a planet orbiting 
Procyon
.

Larry awakens again in a nightmare future. Far from the highly advanced past, now an enormous human population – 3.5 trillion – covers every inch of the planet in underground shaft cities. Technology and science have degraded, and all freely breeding species have been exterminated except for the five-toed neolithic humans, which are classified as a garden varmint. The 'Hive' or human population of Nebishes – four-toed humans – within its computer-supported subterranean culture ruthlessly hunts, kills, and recycles anyone who consumes their crops, the Benthic Beasts, which are five-toed humans that have formed a precarious niche in abandoned underwater rec domes.

As Larry is trying to adapt to his new life, without most of his own body or his ""cyber"" torso, accompanied by Big Har, a genetic defect sent for destruction as an infant but managing to escape 'tweenwalls' in the shaft city- something re-awakens an ancient, half-derelict cyborg, the Godwhale of the title. This enormous 'rake' is an ocean-going biota harvester built in part from a genetically modified blue whale. Initially attempting to rejoin human civilization, the Godwhale (named Rorqual Maru or 'Whale Ship' in Japanese), along with its class six companion cyber, Iron Trilobite, eventually teams up with a genetically modified clone of Larry, ARNOLD (Augmented Renal Nucleus of Larry Dever), Larry himself, and an assortment of misfits and refugees from the Hive. Together they set out to try to find out what mysteriously brings the marine biota back to the previously sterile oceans, while a tiny group from the Hive, the outcasts, and their cyber deities survive and thrive in the face of incredible bungling by the 'Class One' computer that manages humanity and the various castes of 'Nebish' humans brought into the fight."

The novel opens when 
Kelric Valdoria
 crash lands on the planet Coba.  An ancient culture with similarities to the 
Raylicans
, Coba is one of the many isolated and forgotten planets of the former 
Ruby Empire
.  
Kelric
 makes several unsuccessful attempts to escape and eventually ends up in jail.  It is there he spends his time (particularly while in isolation) learning the 
dice game
 Quis.

Eventually, 
Kelric
 is released and joins one of the ""estates"" - small 
matriarchical
 provinces or city-states that comprise the population of Coba.  These estates have special dedicated communes that exclusively play Quis, called Calanya.  
Kelric
 becomes a member of one of these communes, known as the ""Calani"".  The society of Coba has, for centuries, replaced war and aggression with competition in Quis.  The Quis also double as an information network, with players revealing information about themselves and their estate while at the same time learn about others.  Finally, as an information-exchange network, Quis allows technology to improve on Coba at an astounding rate.

The strength of a Calani is based on two properties: a player's skill, and the number of different estates they have worked for.  Because of his pleasing appearance and his skill in Quis, 
Kelric
 is coveted by the queens (known as ""Managers"") of the different estates.  
Kelric's
 membership in the estates proceeds as follows: Dahl, Haka, Bahvla, Miesa, Varz, and finally Karn.  Renamed ""Sevtar"", 
Kelric
 has two children with two of his wives (one of which is born 
Rhon
) during his time in the different estates.

Each time 
Kelric
 is traded, his skill and worth increase, in the end reaching legendary status.  In the final trade to Karn, Ixpar Karn trades rule of the planet (in addition to being Karn Manager, Ixpar also held the title of ""Minister"" of Coba) for 
Kelric
.  This eventually ignites actual violence, allowing 
Kelric
 to escape.

The end of this novel is where

Quis
[
edit
]


Quis
 refers to a dice game learned by Kelric on the planet Coba.

This dice strategy game can be played with a physical set of dice that are made from hand-crafted jewels; or it can be played mentally.  It originates on a planet called Coba, a former colony of the 
Ruby Empire
 that became isolated during the empire's collapses and remains so even during the time of the novels.  All members of Coban society learn to play Quis, but only a few excel at it.

The Quis dice can be used for a variety of purposes, including as a game, to tell stories, to exchange information, and even to gamble.  But its most important use is its influence on politics, as the dice are used to compete politically, and also can convey politically important information.

There are competing city-states that have isolated top Quis players, who study the art of playing Quis as their full-time occupation."

A scientist by the name of Dennis Nuel is working at, and attending, an institute of scientific research and pioneering work into the fictional scientific field of ""Zievatronics"", the manipulation of Time and Space. After the death of his mentor, however, he is taken off the project and another professor takes over.

After a time, the device that has been created to move through space and time, known as the ""Zievatron"" encounters operational problems and is fixed to the co-ordinates of a world  that appears to be very similar to the Earth in most respects, and Dennis is re-recruited to help fix it. He volunteers to be sent to the other world in order to fix the other part of the Zievatron. On arriving to this planet, he finds the Zievatron dismantled and critical parts of it missing. Of the three surveillance robots sent through to this planet, he finds two have also been broken apart. After a while, he finds the last robot, intact and still functioning, and uses it to view any recorded images that might help him identify what it was that happened to the Zievatron.

In this world, instead of objects wearing out as you use them, they improve. This is referred to as the 
Practice Effect
. For example, swords get sharper with use, baskets get stronger the more things they carry, mirrors, furniture and decorations look more attractive the more they are looked at. The physical structure of objects changes in a way so as to become a better version of its previous existence with Practice, like the growth and evolution of a life form. The downside is that an object's condition deteriorates over time if not put to use. Under the prevailing social system, members of society's higher strata exert ownership over objects that they do not improve themselves but rather employ servants to improve by use of the Practice Effect.

It is eventually discovered that the Practice Effect is the result of an elusive, biologically-engineered creature known as a Krenegee Beast that causes a change in a 
law of thermodynamics
. This creature emits a field under which the Practice Effect works. The closer one is to the Krenegee Beasts, the more efficient the Practice that is done. The Practice Effect can take many months before an object reaches its maximum point of ""practice"", but the process is sped up if one is under a Felthesh Trance. The presence of a Krenegee Beast speeds up the process more than a Felthesh Trance."

World at the End of Time
 follows the story of a young Earth-born human, Viktor Sorricaine, on a colony expedition to a distant star system. The colonists are frozen for the long trip between stars. Unknown to both the humans of Earth and the colonists, the stars around them are home to immensely long-lived (effectively immortal) 
plasma
 creatures—with no knowledge of, or interest in, the activities of insignificant matter creatures.

Wan-To, one of the oldest and most powerful plasma creatures, is engaged in a war. After creating modified copies of himself, or ""children"", for company, Wan-To finds himself in a deadly game of chess with them. The ""board"" is the entire galaxy and the weapons are the stars themselves. Each star may be home to an enemy ""child""; using a variety of exotic particles, Wan-To is able to cause a targeted star to flare and kill any enemy that may be living within it. Some time after the colonists have left Earth, its own sun falls victim to the war, being made to explode with humanity on Earth being destroyed as 
collateral damage
. The colonists are thus the only humans left.

Into the middle of this battlefield, the three colony ships (
Ark
, 
New Mayflower
 and 
Argosy
) unwittingly head for their new home. Upon arriving, the colony begins to establish itself ... only to discover that their entire local group of stars appears to be undergoing a bizarre acceleration, and are dimming. After a disastrous disease outbreak and 
terraforming
 failures, the desperate colonists eventually decide to investigate the strange radiation emissions from a small world within their solar system.

Upon arriving in orbit, their ship is badly damaged and Viktor is forced into the onboard freezer systems. They are eventually rescued and unfrozen four hundred of the colony's years later, to find the colony in an even more desperate situation. The star around which the colony's world orbits has dimmed considerably (owing to the energy being siphoned off to accelerate it) and they are now travelling so fast that, because of relativistic effects, the universe around them has shrunk to a bright dot. The colony has become factionalized and heavily religious, with scientific investigation discouraged.

Viktor is eventually frozen again for attempting to investigate why they have been accelerating. He wakes four thousand of the colony's years later, to find the far descendants of the colony have rebuilt their society into habitats closely orbiting the dim star (a 
brown dwarf
) and created a high-technology civilization dedicated to pleasure and comfort. He makes his way, eventually, to the former colony to find only a few fellow-colonists unfrozen and attempting to rebuild it. His unique status as someone who was born on ""old Earth"" brings publicity to their efforts and the rebuilding forges ahead.

During the four thousand years of Viktor's frozen sleep, the star system has been slowed again. After the vast amount of time that has passed, all that remains of the once young universe are dead stars and black holes, with Wan-To desperately surviving on the energy provided by 
proton decay
. Wan-To receives a 
tachyon
 transmission from his long-forgotten systems and makes preparations to move into these last remaining stars — believing that the small matter creatures inhabiting the system are irrelevant and can be destroyed as a result should they become an irritation."

Nona, an unknown being housed in the body of Harrowhark, awakens on an unknown planet. Harrow, along with the cavalier Pyrrha in the Lyctor Gideon's body, was rescued by Camilla and Palamedes (who are now sharing a body) from the River at the end of 
Harrow the Ninth
. Despite carrying out a number of tests, Camilla and Palamedes are unable to determine Nona's true identity, though they believe she is either Gideon or Harrow. Nona displays several magical abilities: she heals faster than a Lyctor, and she understands any language (including body language).

Nona works as a teacher's assistant at a school where she befriends local kids. She, Camilla, Palamedes, Pyrrha, and Coronabeth Tridentarius (now called ""Crown"") are together working as ""Troia cell,"" an operation run by the Blood of Eden (BoE) rebel group. Troia reports to We Suffer, who controls a BoE faction seeking to negotiate with the Nine Houses, with the secret objective of gathering the necessary materials to open the Locked Tomb. We Suffer hopes that Nona will prove to be a Lyctor who can aid them in the execution of this objective. We Suffer's faction is in conflict with the militant, anti-negotiation ""Merv Wing,"" commanded by Unjust Hope, which publicly burns to death all ""zombies"" (anyone suspected of being necromantic).

The Empire's military branch, the Cohort, has abandoned the planet save for a few holdouts in the barracks following the arrival of Resurrection Beast Number 7, Varun. Varun is ""periscoping""—it is projecting a spirit-image of itself as a prelude to full materialization. This drives any necromancer insane, except for those protected by being in non-necromantic bodies. For this reason, Judith Deuteros, Heir to the Second House and a BoE captive, is an incoherent vessel for Varun to speak through. Only Nona can understand its screams, and it seems to know her, calling her a ""green thing.""

Ianthe Tridentarius arrives onworld looking for the Sixth House, which has deserted from the Nine Houses following the testimony of its leader (Palamedes) and instructions left by its Lyctor (Cassiopeia). Ianthe pilots the dead body of her cavalier Naberius to avoid being driven mad by Varun, and demands all House citizens turn themselves in. Crown goes to meet her, pretending to be seeking asylum for Judith, while Pyrrha also appears in the guise of the Lyctor Gideon. Having seen the inside of the barracks, Pyrrha is able to provide BoE key intel via a bug hidden on Judith, using coded words previously arranged with the others.

Camilla and Palamedes arrive at the barracks with Nona pretending to be Harrow. Manipulating Ianthe in order to touch her, Palamedes takes control of Naberius' body. The groups proceeds to find Gideon Nav's body, who initially pretends to be dead, only to reveal that her soul, or part of it (or a version of it) is in fact animating the now-invulnerable corpse. She calls herself Prince Kiriona, Heir to the Nine Houses.

Varun begins to materialize and its insectoid herald warriors fall to the planet's surface. After talking through Judith with Nona atop of a truck, Varun agrees to pull back. Unfortunately, many of its heralds have already arrived. We Suffer's faction takes cover underground, where they find and capture Merv Wing's convoy transporting the Sixth House hostages.

With everyone of import now assembled, they intend to complete the mission of opening the Locked Tomb. This requires travel through the River, something only a powerful Lyctor can achieve. Camilla and Palamedes therefore merge their souls in an advanced form of Lyctorhood, and are able to move a megatruck into the River. Here they find no ravenous ghosts, but instead a mysterious tower.

Nona helps them pilot to the Ninth House. She feels that she is dying; she states she does not have the right soul for the body that she's in, and so is coming untethered and losing her ability to control Harrow's body. She is increasingly aware of other thoughts in her mind: either the residual souls of Harrow and Gideon (the body's previous owners), or the thoughts of Nona's true self who can ""remember.""

They find that the Ninth House is under attack from unknown entities called devils, the same possessive force that killed Colum in the first book. Ianthe attempts to block their way to the tomb, but she is bested thanks to Gideon's triple cross and Pyrrha's herald bullet. Gideon claims that God wants the tomb open, but the truth of the matter is unclear.

Entering the tomb, Nona remembers having done this before, proving after many increasingly clear hints that she is none other than Alecto, the body in the tomb. Alecto entered Harrow's body when Harrow was ten, when she opened the tomb and kissed the body, providing a conduit for possession. This is why Harrow had visions of the body; Alecto was possessing her the whole time. Alecto finally took control, manifesting as Nona, after Gideon and Harrow's souls were removed at the end of the preceding novel. At that time, Gideon was possibly removed by God, and Harrow intentionally placed her own soul in the Locked Tomb in Alecto's sleeping body.

These events are interspersed with dreamlike memories in which John Gaius reveals the secrets behind the destruction of Earth and his ascent to divinity: he destroyed the already dying Earth, consumed much of her soul to become God, and stuffed the rest of the Earth into a body inspired by his favourite Barbie. Each of these chapters is titled with a reference to a verse from 
John's Gospel
.

Now Nona reunites with Alecto's body, and the souls are switched to their correct places. Alecto returns to her body, waking it, and Harrow returns to hers. Harrow declares her love for Alecto, only for Alecto to swear service to Harrow as the descendent of Anastasia (founder of the Ninth House, to whom Alecto swore a sacred oath). Alecto then proceeds to travel through the river to John Gaius, who she then stabs through the chest."

In 2055, an S45 sensitive named Eric is assigned to assassinate Jack Jacques, but gets cold feet. Jacques survives, and Eric remains as a disgraced agent.

In 2067, Aminat is working for S45, attempting to find a cure for xenoforms. Xenoforms are slowly replacing all human cells; humanity is projected to be completely replaced within decades.

Anthony, the human avatar of Wormwood, receives a message from Home, his native planet. Wormwood is a footholder, a sentient but lesser species than Homians. Footholders require another sentient being, such as a human or Homian, to serve as their host. Home is now uninhabitable; Homians now exist only as digitized copies of their former selves. Homians planned to find Home-like worlds, replace the native fauna with xenoforms, and upload their consciousnesses into these new life forms. The first human has become 100% xenoform, but an attempted consciousness upload has failed. A Homian scientist orders Anthony to investigate. Anthony finds that a Homian species of plant, which disrupts xenoforms, has appeared in Rosewater.

Meanwhile, a woman named Alyssa Sutcliffe awakens to find that she has lost all of her memories. She begins experiencing memories from a Homian consciousness. Aminat extracts Alyssa from a hospital.

Jack Jacques is now the mayor of Rosewater. The Nigerian president attempts to assassinate him. Jacques declares Rosewater an independent city-state. He has a contentious partnership with Femi Alaagomeji, head of S45; Femi instructs him to contact Kaaro for help. Riots disrupt the city. Aminat and Alyssa search for safety. Alyssa grows to like Aminat and to understand more about humans during this journey. Eventually, Kaaro, Alyssa, and Aminat reach the mayor's mansion.

With S45's help, Eric has survived the culling of human sensitives. He is ordered to kill Jacques. Eric bombs Jacques's car; Jacques loses his leg, but survives. Eric escapes Rosewater.

The alien plant begins taking on humanoid shapes and attacking Wormwood's dome. The populace begins referring to the plant creatures as Beynons. Kaaro and Aminat enter the dome. Molara tells them that Anthony is dead and Wormwood is dying; it needs a new host. Kaaro kills the Beynons, and Alyssa becomes the new host for Wormwood. She removes the dome and drives the Nigerian army away from Rosewater, solidifying its status as an independent state. Meanwhile, Jacques has Femi arrested and imprisoned.

The Homians agree to stop replacing living humans. Instead, they will occupy the bodies of reanimates. Thousands of Homians download their consciousnesses into Rosewater, ushering in a new era for humanity and Homians alike."

Acceptance
 jumps around in time and between the perspectives of several characters from the first two novels in the Southern Reach Series.

Annihilation, the first book in the series, was focused on a character known as The Biologist. She was part of a team that entered Area X, a restricted and uninhabited zone known for having anomalous events, which is controlled by a government organization called The Southern Reach. After being exposed to strange spores, she begins a transformation she calls ""brightness"". She investigates Area X, with an emphasis on an abandoned lighthouse which may have been the beginning site of the strange events.

Authority
, the second book in the series, followed the character John Rodriguez, a.k.a. ""Control"". An employee of the Southern Reach, he was tasked with interviewing what appears to be the Biologist, who escaped from Area X and prefers to be called ""Ghost Bird"". Later he determines Ghost Bird is not the biologist, but a duplicate of her which began germinating in Area X. When Area X begins to grow beyond its boundaries, Rodriguez flees with Ghost Bird.



The Lighthouse Keeper
[
edit
]


In the years before Area X, Saul Evans — the Lighthouse Keeper introduced in 
Annihilation
 — builds a friendship with nine-year-old Gloria, the girl who becomes the psychologist of the twelfth expedition and the former Director of the Southern Reach. While maintaining the lighthouse (the same one found in Area X), Saul is frustrated by the constant visits of Henry and Suzanne, two members of the Séance & Science Brigade (S&SB) who perform unknown experiments involving the lighthouse's lens. Later, a fire breaks out on nearby Failure Island, destroying S&SB's headquarters. While cleaning the grounds, Saul sees a mysterious flower of light on the floor. As he attempts to pluck it, it stabs his finger. Saul begins to have vivid nightmares: he imagines walking into his lighthouse only to discover it has transformed into the Tower. When he awakens, Saul begins reciting the sermon written by the Crawler on the walls of the Tower. Over time Saul becomes increasingly obsessed with the sermon.

Gloria leaves to be with her father just before Saul returns to the lighthouse at night and sees a glowing light emanating from the trapdoor beside the lens. Saul enters the light. When he awakens, he finds Henry and Suzanne's bodies beside him. However, a 
doppelgänger
 of Henry arrives and confronts Saul. The two eventually fall off the side of the lighthouse. Saul survives, but as he attempts to escape, visions of Area X flood his mind. Saul finally stops running, having accepted defeat. A tunnel, later referred to by expedition members as a tower, forms at the site where Saul falls. Saul becomes the Crawler which scrawls the organic words which descend the Tower.



The Psychologist/Director
[
edit
]


The second timeline describes Gloria's initial acceptance into the Southern Reach and her promotion to Director. She has a strained relationship with Lowry, the only survivor of the first expedition and the man responsible for organizing each subsequent journey into Area X. Without alerting anyone at the Southern Reach, Gloria secretly crosses the border into Area X with Whitby, a scientist working for the Southern Reach. She visits her childhood home, encounters the Crawler in the Tower, and visits the lighthouse. While Whitby is upstairs, he apparently (unseen to the Director) struggles with his duplicate and says that he killed it just before she rushed up to find him bruised and scratched, with no sign of the Dead Whitby. The Director finds a backpack Whitby swears belonged to Dead Whitby containing the cell phone and plant first mentioned in 
Authority
.

Upon her return, the Director refuses to relate her experiences to Lowry. Instead, she begins planning the twelfth expedition and interviews the biologist for the mission. It is then revealed that the Director has terminal cancer. She, therefore, decides to join the twelfth expedition in the hopes of visiting Area X one last time. The Director also learns that the S&SB may have been involved in the creation of Area X. When she confronts Lowry about this, he refuses to admit it. Finally, the Director pulls out a photo of the cell phone she found in Area X, arguing that it belonged to Lowry and was used to communicate with Area X. The Director believes that Area X is trying to communicate with Lowry because it has been found in such a serendipitous way and considering the strange goings-on surrounding it after it is found. Lowry eventually admits the phone belonged to him and storms off.

The Director's story ends with her embarking on the twelfth expedition as the psychologist. In her pocket is a letter to Saul Evans, which she hopes to give him when they meet again. However, as seen in 
Annihilation
, the Director dies before Saul can receive her message: an apology for never returning to the lighthouse as a child, thanks for his friendship and guidance, and a promise always to remember him as the Keeper of the Light.



Control & Ghost Bird
[
edit
]


Control and Ghost Bird enter Area X through a previously unknown portal. They wander in the wilderness before arriving at Failure Island, where they encounter Grace Stevenson (the assistant director of the Southern Reach, whom Control had previously worked with). She had fled the agency after killing a doppelganger and fleeing with a group of personnel into Area X.

Grace reveals why Area X grows so quickly: time moves faster inside the border during specific ""cosmic"" shifts that seem to happen randomly. Although Control and Ghost Bird have only been gone a few weeks, Grace has been waiting on the Island for three years. This also accounts for how some expeditions never return, as they may have been trapped there for years and eventually died. Grace also shows them the biologist's ""Last Will and Testament,"" detailing what happened to her after the events of 
Annihilation
: the biologist arrived at the Island in search of her husband, believing that the man who returned from the eleventh expedition was a copy of her husband generated by Area X. The biologist instead encounters an owl which becomes her companion for the next thirty years. The owl behaves strangely compared to typical owl behavior. Over time she comes to believe that the owl is the form that her husband took after he was changed by Area X. She has held off the takeover by the brightness, using pain as a way for her body to resist it, and believes that her eventual change will likely be more radical, perhaps into something like the moaning creature. Eventually, the owl dies, and the brightness that afflicts the biologist swallows her whole.

Grace announces that the biologist is returning to the Island. Ghost Bird — herself a copy of the biologist generated by Area X — encounters her original self, transformed into a staggeringly immense, hyper-sentient, whale-like creature, unbound by physical law and covered with eyes. Control, Ghost Bird, and Grace decide to return to the Tower, where Ghost Bird encounters the Crawler. When she touches it, she sees the birth of Area X as if it is its own universe. Grace shoots at the Crawler and accidentally hits Ghost Bird.

Meanwhile, Control, overcome by the brightness, is transforming into something nonhuman, a loping creature with paws. Maimed by the Crawler and close to death, he descends further into the Tower. As he comes closer to the light at the bottom of the Tower, he realizes that it is the flower that pricked Saul and created Area X. He leaps into the light.

Grace and Ghost Bird exit the Tower and head to the border. Ghost Bird is ambivalent about the possible total expansion of Area X but is mindful of Grace and her connection to others outside of Area X. They find the Southern Reach building abandoned. The two continue walking, unsure if Area X is gone or if the border has expanded even further."

The novel is narrated by Victor, a former 
Person Bound to Labor
 ('peeb') who, after escaping the Hard Four, has been forced to work as an undercover agent for U.S. Marshal Bridge, infiltrating and gathering evidence to prosecute fellow escapees and the people and organizations helping peebs escape slavery. If Victor refuses to help, the agent has threatened to return him to the plantation from which he escaped; and he can be tracked by a device implanted in his spine if he tries to run.
[

]


As the novel opens, Victor is tracking down the peeb escapee Jackdaw, whose last known whereabouts have led Victor to 
Indianapolis.
 His trail ends at Saint Anselm's 
Catholic
 Promise, a seemingly derelict community center run by Father Barton. Victor poses as Jim Dirkson, a consultant for Indonesian cell carrier Sulawesi Digital, looking to expand into the United States, seeking to get his wife Gentle out of the Carolina plantation in which she is enslaved and into Little America, a suburb of 
Montreal
 mainly populated by 
African Americans
 in exile.

Victor befriends Martha, a white woman with a mixed-race child, after they are ejected from a hotel for stealing from the breakfast buffet. Eventually, Victor locates Jackdaw, who is revealed to be a freeborn African-American college student named Kevin. He was sent by Barton to infiltrate Garments of the Greater South, Inc., purportedly to expose how they have been illegally selling slave-made goods to the rest of the United States (where such goods are unlawful) through shell companies located in 
Malaysia
. Barton contends that this explosive revelation could bring down slavery, or at least assassinate the credibility of its proponents.

Kevin, however, refuses to give up the location of the 'evidence' unless they also extract a slave girl he had fallen for during his year behind the Fence. In a commotion, after he became enraged at the news that the girl was probably dead, Kevin is shot dead by an Indianapolis police officer who is working with Father Barton. Victor is then coerced by Father Barton to go back to GGSI to retrieve the intel.

Victor deduces something larger is at play and gets Martha to play his 'Missus' through the slavery-embracing Hard Four states so they can investigate GGSI. Martha, for her part, is seeking access to Torchlight; a centralized registry of every Person Bound to Labor in the United States – specifically, she wants to find out what happened to Samson, her son's father. Victor decides to double-cross Father Barton, and makes another deal with Bridge. He does not believe the intelligence being retrieved would make any difference, and decides to use the 
U.S. Marshal Service
 to secure his own freedom. Bridge is compelled to play along after Victor bluffs about the damaging nature of the evidence to the Service.

At the Fence, Victor disguises himself as Martha's slave, endures a dehumanizing inspection by Internal Border and Regulation agents, and the two make their way to Green Hollow, Alabama. In Green Hollow, Victor sends Martha back north and meets up with former peebs who hide out at a sympathetic old white lawyer's mansion; he is accommodated there as he prepares to insert himself into GGSI. 

Martha unexpectedly returns to Victor's side, and they succeed in infiltrating GGSI's HQ, obtaining the intel as well as information on Samson. He and Martha are unexpectedly abducted by 
IMPD
 Officer Cook, one of Father Barton's colleagues from Indianapolis. It turns out that Cook, like Victor, is also an undercover agent for the Marshal Service; he betrays both Father Barton and Victor to secure his own freedom. In the ensuing struggle, Cook is shot dead.

When confronted by Victor, Father Barton reveals that the evidence is much more horrifying: GGSI has been experimenting with the eggs of female slaves to genetically produce a new line of slaves who can be legally classified as non-humans. Victor pretends to co-operate with Barton. Telling Bridge he has the intel, they rendezvous in a makeshift operating tent off of a highway, so his tracking implant can be removed and Bridge can give him a new identity. During the exchange, however, Barton and his comrades ambush Bridge, killing the medical technician he had brought along, and is about to kill Bridge, when Victor says to spare him instead. In gratitude, Bridge removes the implant himself, and Victor passes out, waking up to an empty tent.

The novel ends with the undercover Victor and Martha in Chicago, checking into the HQ of the elevator company that contracts with GGSI - plotting sabotage.

From 
New York City
 in 1921, four people sail to 
England
 to meet with Walter Jenkins, the original author of the 
War of the Worlds
 story. Jenkins has seen signs that the Martians may be planning a second attack. They arrive to find 
London
 has become a 
totalitarian
 
dystopia
 and the whole country is gearing up for war. Walter's brother, Frank, is conscripted the next day and London prepares for war. Beginning at 7:00pm, 50 cylinder-shaped Martian missiles land on the city, wiping out nearly half of the 
British Armed Forces
. At midnight, another group of cylinders lands, carrying Martian warriors. The Martians emerge immediately, in contrast to the 19 hours required in their 1907 landings, and engage the British military with their heat rays. Counterattacks by the Army, the Navy and the relatively new Air Force prove mostly harmless against the Martian fighting-machines. Over the next few days, the Martians cripple London, carefully selecting targets of infrastructural importance, such as bridges, factories and railway stations. Many Londoners escape or take shelter.

2 years later in 1923, the Martians control England, though they mostly remain within their cordon. Jenkins asks Julie Elphinstone, his former sister-in-law, to go into the Martian cordon to try to communicate with them. She and her group make the long journey to there, dodging several Martian attacks along the way and meeting a 
saboteur
 named Marriott. At the Martian base, they discover that the Martians are carnivorous, keeping humans and humanoid species in holding tanks for future harvesting. They witness breeding experiments between Martians and humans. Eventually, they come to the feeding hole, where the Martians have humans hung upside-down from scaffolding while they inject the human's blood directly into their Martian bodies.

As the Martians continue to conquer other parts of Earth, Julie comes up with a plan. Knowing that the Martians communicate with their home planet by using 
sigils
 carved into the earth's surface, she wonders whether it would be possible to change the sigils and therefore disrupt communications. Eric Eden, a veteran of the first Martian war, agrees to let her attempt it. Eden transports Julie inside the cordon with his ""landship"", a massive 
tank
-like vehicle the size of a battleship. Julie contacts the saboteur Marriott, who agrees to detonate numerous explosives to change the Martian sigils into the circular 
Jovian
 symbols. Within two hours, the Martians have withdrawn and the Jovians leave their circular sigil on the moon.

The book jumps forward 14 years to 1937. The Martians are still on Earth but no one knows where. Jenkins takes Julie half a mile into the earth to the underground Martian city in England. He speculates that this is how they live on Mars, that they have no secrets because of their telepathy, and that they are all treated as equals. The British Martians built a 
space gun
 and fired themselves back to Mars. 

Reports say that other Martians moved to the Earth's poles where the climate is more Mars-like. Julie, Jenkins, Eden and some others take a massive German 
Zeppelin
 to the Arctic, where they see a Martian 
terraforming
 operation. Jenkins theorizes that, with the Jovians watching, they are forced to colonize rather than conquer, and that humans should work with them instead of against.

When Earth-Mars 
opposition
 comes around again, the Martians do not launch any cylinders. The war of the worlds is over.

In addition to the main storyline, the novel contains various standalone vignettes depicting Martian attacks in New York City, 
Berlin
 and 
Los Angeles

In 2025 and 2026, after the Gaia-worshipping but environmentally destructive ""Daybreak"" movement unleashed a nanotech plague and nuclear and EMP attacks, the population of Earth has been greatly reduced and forced back to 19th-century or earlier technology. Two regions, one with its capital in 
Seattle, Washington
 and the other with its capital in 
Athens, Georgia
, claim to be continuing the government of the U.S., while semi-independent regions around New York (increasingly fascist), in California (feudal), in Colorado (ostensibly neutral and dedicated to research and communications) and in Texas have some desire to participate in a restored U.S.  Much of the Northeast is inhabited by ""tribals"" who have been mysteriously brainwashed into ""Daybreak"", but in one of their strongholds, Lord Robert is breaking away from the movement.

Despite tensions between the secularist believers in human rights in the Northwest and the 
fundamentalist Christian
 theocrats in the South, most of the regions attempt coordinate in a military campaign against the tribals and build up to a Presidential election to reunify the country.  However, it turns out that the leaders of those regions were tricked into the campaign by Daybreak because it unifies it with Lord Robert.  The U.S. forces are defeated disastrously.  One of the leaders in Colorado makes herself president for the sole purpose of dissolving the United States and resigning.  She and other survivors of the reunification attempt find refuge in California and the West Indies, which may become centers of the drive to rebuild civilization."

The story of 
Spinning Silver
 unfolds in the voices of several characters, but primarily in the voices of three young women who struggle against strong evil forces, in an imaginary medieval eastern European kingdom called Lithvas.
[
1
]


Over the last seven years, Lithvas has been suffering from long, brutal winters that are slowly killing its people. Miryem Mandelstam, a young Jewish girl, takes over her father's moneylending business to save her family from poverty. A village girl, Wanda and later her brother, become the Mandelstams' servants. One night, Miryem, flush with her financial success, brags to her mother that she can “turn silver into gold”. Her boast is overheard by the Staryk, a race of 
fae
 creatures who emerge from their own world every winter to raid human settlements, and Miryem receives three deliveries of magical silver. Realizing that the Staryk will kill her if she does not give them gold in exchange, she has the metal made into three pieces of jewellery to sell. However, after the sale of the second piece, Miryem demands payment for her work; to Miryem’s horror, the Staryk king tells her that after the third, her ""reward"" will be marriage to him.

The jewellery is bought by the duke of the city of Vysnia for his daughter, Irina; he then persuades Mirnatius, the tsar of Lithvas, to marry her. On her wedding night, Irina discovers that while wearing her Staryk jewellery, she can cross into the Staryk kingdom and magically observe her husband. Mirnatius has a contract allowing his body to be inhabited by 
Chernobog
, a demon who drinks souls and can only emerge at night due to his hatred of sunlight. Each evening, the new tsarina escapes to the fae world, where she is safe from the demon.

After the Staryk king abducts Miryem to his palace, she learns that she can literally change silver into gold with a touch. She also discovers that the Staryk king is responsible for lengthening the winters in Lithvas, and that it is his desire to make them permanent. Although she hates her husband, who refuses even to tell her his name due to the power over him it would give her, Miryem comes to know and care for some of the Staryk; she also sees that their kingdom is suffering mysterious damages. While out exploring, Miryem encounters Irina. The two women create a plan to bring their husbands together, in the hopes that they will destroy one another. Because Miryem cannot cross to the human world alone, she bargains with the king: he will take her to attend her cousin’s wedding in Vysnia if she can transform three of his enormous vaults of silver within three days. She succeeds, barely, with the help of her servants.

Chernobog promises that, in exchange for Irina giving him the Staryk king, he will never harm her or anyone she cares about. She takes him to the wedding, where he confronts the king. With the help of the mortals, the demon imprisons the Staryk and begins consuming his magic. Mirnatius tells Irina that he did not choose the contract with Chernobog, but was promised to the demon by his own mother in exchange for her marrying his father, the previous tsar. Once the king is bound, spring arrives. However, Miryem is troubled to realize that the fae kingdom and its inhabitants, including those who helped her, will all be destroyed as the king is drained. She goes to her husband and learns that, while the Staryk have always raided the human world, they began trying to exterminate Lithvas with brutal winters only after Mirnatius became tsar. Through the magical connection between the fae and human kingdoms, the demon caused the weakening of the Staryk world.

Miryem frees the king after extracting a promise that he will end the killing winters and the raids. Chernobog, enraged, threatens Irina until she offers to take him to the Staryk kingdom. There, Miryem lures the demon into the king’s treasury, and once he is surrounded by silver, she turns it into gold. Unable to bear the touch of solid sunlight on his skin, Chernobog flees back to the human world. In the mortal lands, the demon attempts to turn on Irina, but finds himself powerless when she reminds him of their bargain not to harm her or anyone of hers. As tsarina, she counts all the people of Lithvas as hers - including the tsar. Chernobog is thus forced from Mirnatius's body and killed.

As spring has returned to Lithvas, Miryem is obliged to remain in the Staryk kingdom until the day of the first snow. However, when she returns to the human world, she realizes that she has become attached to the kingdom, its people, and its king. She is nevertheless astonished when the king asks for permission to court her. She consents, and the pair are wed two weeks later. Miryem notes that, in accordance with Jewish custom, her husband signed his name on their marriage contract - but in accordance with Staryk custom, she will never reveal it to anyone.

When Yalda is three years old, she accompanies her grandfather Dario into the forest to convalesce, but he instead passes away. The following spring, she sees a shooting star in the sky. When Yalda is twelve years old, she joins school and learns about the basic laws of physics, including those of light, leading her to realize that space and time are exactly the same. The following summer, she observes multiple shooting stars hurtling across the sky. When Yalda has reached adulthood and embarked a career as a physicist, she begins to study light and in particular the strange phenomenon now known as the Hurtlers, which all enter the planetary system from the same spacial direction, but at different times. Yalda theorizes, that the roles are reversed for the Hurtlers, meaning for them an entire cluster spread over space arrives at the same time, hence the direction of time of this cluster and their own are orthogonal to each other. Now their home world is threatened by the arrival of the Hurtlers and might face complete destruction by an impending collision.

An unusual reaction to this crisis is brought up by Eusebio, a student of Yalda. Developing the technology necessary will take too much time, therefore a generation ship must be sent into the void to exploit relativistic effects to find the time elsewhere. While accelerating, deaccelerating as well as turning the ship around, time will pass on the home world. But the journey aligned with the orthogonal cluster and the velocity of the Hurtlers and as long as needed will be witnessed as being along a purely spatial dimension from the home world, hence in an orthogonal direction. Yalda remarks that the largest rockets build yet have a lot smaller size. Eusebio had taken this into account: Since the nearby Mount Peerless is made out of very hard sunstone, it can be turned into the rocket needed. The plan then includes blasting the whole mountain into the sky.

Eusebio conducts the first experiments of sending sunstone off their world on Mount Peerless and finally succeeds by launching a piece into orbit around their sun. Yalda receives a letter of her sister Lucia meanwhile, in which she informs her of changes on the farm and her decision of becoming a mother, resulting in the end of her own life due to their way of reproduction. Yalda and Eusebio travel around different cities to gather endorsement for their plan. Yalda meets Benedetta, with whom she has a conversation about that the course of the rocket points into its own past, which allows for the conclusion of 
determinism
 in their universe. The question arises, if their already predetermined actions are then even relevant at all. Yalda can convince Benedetta, who then decides to be the first passenger. At night, Yalda and Eusebio witness the destruction of the twin planets Gemma and Gemmo in their own system by one of the Hurtlers. This catastrophic event causes massive endorsement for their plan and the preparation of Mount Peerless begins.

Five years later, the work is almost done, but the 
Peerless
 still lacks a proper crew due to safety concerns or the restricted quality of life on board. Even for many working on the rocket, just waiting for four years on the home world for its return with incredibly advanced technology is the preferred option. Benedetta has send out space probes, which have examined the Hurtlers and determined their direction of time, which turns out to not be perfectly orthogonal to that of their home world. Luckily, the 
Peerless
 will first travel into the future of the orthogonal cluster, pushing certain problems with 
causality
 to the return journey into its past. Benedetta then plans to test a rocket made out of sunstone herself to persuade the workers of its safety, but instead dies pointlessly during the test. Eusebio tells Yalda, that he won't join the journey and stay behind on the home world to fight for launching another generation ship in case the 
Peerless
 will fail and won't return in four years.

After the 
Peerless
 has been launched and entered the orthogonal cluster, the crew encounters the first major problem: Their crops seem to rely on gravity to grow, which is no longer present after the acceleration phase. Constructions begin on getting the mountain to spin to generate 
artificial gravity
 and making the crops grow again. In the meantime, Yalda and the other females on board begin to slowly use up their stocks of Holin, a drug to halt spontaneous reproduction with more being needed with older age. Yalda needs multiple the amount than younger females, which makes her reflect on her role in the journey and that she may have had the illusion to experience its return. Yalda realizes that the journey is now about the next generation, whom she has already taught everything she knew during the acceleration phase, so she and the other older females make their conscious decision for reproduction. Yalda hands over the command of the 
Peerless
 and then mates with Nino, who was imprisoned for engaging in espionage during the construction of the 
Peerless
. In her final moments, she thinks about the life of her children lying ahead."

 in addition to their vast technological resources. They have created hundreds of sapient races, interlocked in a culture of breathtaking complexity and beauty. The execution of justice falls to children of the destroyed planets. Those from Earth base their on-ship culture on 
Peter Pan
, calling themselves Wendys and Lost Boys.

It is revealed once the Leviathan system is destroyed that the Killers were, in fact, still active within the system, continuing to manufacture fleets of self-replicating machines to destroy alien races. However, while the Killers were destroyed and justice served, trillions of what were likely innocents had to die to accomplish this. Bear leaves the human crew torn between relief that their work is complete and their guilt that they were little better than those they had come to destroy."

Bloom
 is set in the year 2106, in a world where 
self-replicating nanomachines
 called ""Mycora"" have consumed 
Earth
 and other planets of the 
inner Solar System
, forcing humankind to eke out a bleak living in the 
asteroids
 and 
Galilean moons
.  Two groups of humanity are described—The Immunity, who use ""
ladderdown
"" technology and 
augmented reality
 and live on the moons of Jupiter, and The Gladholders, who use human 
intelligence amplification
 and 
artificial intelligence
 and live in the asteroid belt. The story begins on 
Ganymede
 with an article about a ""bloom"", or outbreak of Mycora, that serves to emphasize the danger and horror of this technogenic life (TGL).  The article is written by Strasheim, the primary narrator character. He is first seen in the office of Chief of Immunology Lottick, the effective ruler of Ganymede, who has called him there for an unknown purpose.

Lottick tells Strasheim that the Mycora have apparently been stealing or assimilating human designed defensive nanotech and may soon develop resistance to the coldness of the 
outer Solar System
, which incites concern. It is planned to send mission to drop TGL detectors onto the polar ice caps of Mars, Earth, and the Moon, and Lottick asks Strasheim to go along as a 
reporter
. For the longer term, a starship is being constructed to colonize other star systems before the Mycora spreads further outwards.

Strasheim agrees, and goes to meet the other crew-members and inspect the ship, which is called the 
Louis Pasteur
.  The ship is technologically camouflaged to protect the crew against Mycora.  A terrorist attack releases a Mycora bloom in the hangar, killing one crew member and forcing the others to launch the 
Pasteur
 and escape—departing three weeks earlier than planned, and without adequate supplies.

Because of their forced launch, the 
Pasteur
 docks at Saint Helier, a medium-sized Floral 
asteroid
 of the Gladholders to pick up supplies.  While there, they are surprised by the culture multiple times, but what shocks them most is that the asteroid's inhabitants have apparently discovered, through powerful telescopes, human life on both Earth and Venus, co-existing with the Mycora.

The ""Pasteur"" is pursued by ships of the Temples of Transcendent Evolution, a fringe political/religious group that believes the Mycora are divine, investing large sums of money in researching them.

Searching for ways to defend themselves against the Temple ships, the crew discover that the mission has a somewhat more violent purpose than they were led to believe.  The ""detectors"" they have by this time dropped on Mars, Earth, and Luna can actually be repurposed as ""cascade 
fusion
"" devices.

Shaken, the crew continues on their journey, but become aware that one of the crew is sabotaging the mission. The saboteur turns out to be the Mycorea specialist Baucum, with whom Strasheim has developed a personal relationship. She is secretly a member of the Temples of Transcendent Evolution, and after being discovered, Baucum ruptures a storage bag inside herself that had been carrying spores of Mycora.  Terrified, the crew responds, with Strasheim himself shoving her out an airlock before the Mycora now consuming her can also devour the ship.

It is determined that the mission's actual purpose was to use the detector/bombs to establish small footholds on the three planetary bodies, but it occurs to Strasheim that if such a device were detonated in the Sun, a massive blast of laddered-down iron would wipe out most Mycoran life in the inner Solar System. Several of the Temples' ships that have chased them since Mars, are now desperately attempting to destroy the 
Pasteur
 against this possibility (The 
Pasteur
 is heading toward the Sun to get away from the Mycosystem via an out-of-plane slingshot, but the action could have been construed differently by Temples' agents.).

Having discovered this possibility, the crew decide not to pursue it, but instead transmit the existence of this potential weapon back to the outer Solar System. As a result of the energy of this high power transmition the Mycora break through the hull of the 
Pasteur
, blooming, and unexpectedly assuming the form of a pseudo-human spokesperson. It transpires that the Mycora is 
sapient
 and without ill-will toward humans.  Communication is brief but paradigm-shattering.  The ambassador explains that the majority of persons consumed during the destruction of Earth or on the evacuation out-system was incorporated into the Mycosystem and are still alive in some sense, their consciousness and intelligence adjusted to run on the cellular-automata-like Mycora substrate, or ""Unpacked"". The crew is given information on how to mark areas as off-limits to the Mycosystem. They are told that humanity is, ""...Utterly free. Free to conduct your lives in the classical manner, to escape this solar system, to populate the stars. Free to Unpack, if you choose.""

The book ends almost thirteen years later, with a description of how the captain of the 
Pasteur
 has been diagnosed with a terminal disease and requests that Strasheim (now a successful media magnate) be his witness as he joins the Mycora.

Humanity now generally disregards spaceflight, and space exploration is in massive decline. Hutchins has retired from flying in space and now spends her days throwing fund-raisers in order to finance space exploration through private investors. The space program is on the edge of being terminated, when a physicist named Jon Silvestri announces that he has completed a much more efficient faster-than-light-speed engine, capable of reaching destinations in mere fractions of the time previously required, travelling much farther than Pluto in just under 8 seconds.

With this new drive, destinations such as the galactic core are mere months of travel away. Hutch and the characters in the novel use that engine to journey to the centre of the galaxy, while making stops at a few points of interest including Sigma 2711, a star system 14,000 light years away and the origin of mankind's only received signal from an alien race, a black hole with a mysterious artificial companion and the supposed home planet of a galaxy-wide surveillance system. But their true mission lies at the heart of the galaxy, the supposed origin of the mysterious Omega Clouds, mysterious clouds of energy that travel through space, attacking and destroying any structure with right angles, at regular 8000-year cycles.
As they near their final objective it becomes clear that the true purpose of the clouds is beyond anything any of them could have possibly imagined."

The story is set in a 
dystopian
 future in which an overpopulated world solves the problem by allocating people only one day per week. For the rest of the six days they are ""stoned"", a kind of 
suspended animation
. The novels focus on a man, Jeff Caird, who is a daybreaker, someone who lives more than one day a week. He is not like most daybreakers; he belongs to a government defying group called the “Immers”. The Immers are a very large and powerful group that works to create a better government. Not all Immers are daybreakers, so to get messages and information from one day to the next, they have daybreakers, like Jeff, to work in every day. The daybreakers of the Immers assume seven different personalities and seven different jobs. They slip from culture to culture, in seven different worlds.

As Jeff goes day to day, he runs into problems while working as an Immer and as a daybreaker, and must cover his tracks, all while trying to keep up with his seven different lives, families, friends, and jobs. Eventually the stress makes Jeff unstable, and the Immers must dispose of him to keep the rest of the Immers safe.  Jeff, wanting to live, tries to escape the Immers, but there are undercover Immers in every job, area, and government level. Jeff is caught and put in a sort of insane asylum, classified with “
multiple personality disorder
”, for the legal time before he can be considered “incurable” and killed. But Jeff has an escape plan..."

About 1,000,000 B.C., an unidentified alien race sent out robotic factories to many worlds in their part of the galaxy to prepare for future settlement. One of those factory ships suffers severe radiation damage from a near-miss by a 
supernova
 and goes off course, drifting in space for a hundred thousand years before landing on the Saturnian moon Titan. Due to a malfunction in its database, it begins producing imperfect copies that begin to 
evolve
 on their own. (The description of this background is presented in a prologue
[

 that proved sufficiently popular among readers that it was later anthologized on its own in a collection of Hogan's short fiction.)
[

]
 The resulting machine ecosystem eventually gives rise to humanoid robots with human-like intellects, who develop a civilization similar to early civilization of Earth. Almost all of them have reverence for their mythical creator, a being they call the ""Lifemaker"".

Early in the 21st century, the North Atlantic Space Organization (combining NASA and 
NATO
) dispatched the 
Orion
 with a cover story of 
terraforming
 
Mars
 for human habitation. Karl Zambendorf, a 
con artist
 who is present on this expedition to verify 
ESP
 over interplanetary distances, prematurely learns that the 
Orion
 and its crew of researchers is headed for Titan, where the discovery of the Taloids has been kept need-to-know on Earth.

When the 
Orion
 arrives, the first landing party sets down in a freethinking state where Thirg, a Taloid who was cast out of his home state Kroaxia, has fled. They are mistaken for the Lifemaker because they have come from the sky, which the Taloids cannot see out of due to Titan's atmosphere. But Thirg becomes more discerning as he and the humans begin to understand more of each other's speech. Thirg's brother Groork has come from Kroaxia to apprehend him, but Zambendorf intercepts him and sends him back to Kroaxia as a 
prophet
.

Zambendorf learned that NASO plans to exploit Titan's natural resources and use the Taloids to build the factories they need, reducing them to 
slaves
. The NASO business administrators on the 
Orion
 are already in agreement with the Kroaxian government to use human (the Taloids call humans ""Lumians"" because they glow brightly in their infrared vision) weapons to conquer Titan, believing the Kroaxian leadership buttressed by priests will be the easiest to control. Zambendorf, in his unanticipated role as Messenger for the Lifemaker, has given Groork guidelines akin to the 
Ten Commandments
 for his people to prevent a war from starting. ""All Taloids are brothers"" and ""No Taloid is to enslave or be a slave"" does not sit well with the ruling establishment of Kroaxia, and Groork is saved by the 
Orion
 crew not working for NASO. There will be use of Titan's resources, but the partnership between humans and Taloids will be one of equals.

Background
[
edit
]


274 years ago, Hegemony CEO Meina Gladstone 
ordered the destruction
 of all farcaster portals to stop the TechnoCore from eliminating humankind. This resulted in the collapse of civilization on most planets. Brawne Lamia, pregnant by the first 
John Keats
 cybrid, gave birth to a daughter called Aenea. Lamia died when Aenea was still young, and Silenus raised her. When Aenea was twelve years old, she entered the Time Tombs and disappeared into the future.

Before the Fall, Father Paul Duré was elected as 
Pope
 under the name of 
Teilhard
. When he died unexpectedly, Lenar Hoyt was resurrected from their shared body and elected Pope. The Church developed a new technology that improved the results of the 
resurrection
, so Catholics who accepted the 
cruciform
 became virtually immortal. With help of its military forces (the Pax), the Catholic Church filled the void left by the Hegemony after the Fall. With each subsequent death, Hoyt was resurrected, and Father Duré never again appeared in the public eye.



Aenea's rescue
[
edit
]


On Hyperion, a hunting guide named Raul Endymion is given a mission from Martin Silenus: rescue Aenea, who is about to emerge from the Time Tombs; find Old Earth; destroy the Pax; and stop the TechnoCore. Endymion is helped by android A. Bettik and by the Consul's 
starship
.

The Pax, which teaches that Aenea is a dangerous abomination, knows that she is about to arrive from the Time Tombs. Father-Captain Federico de Soya is instructed to capture her. 
The Shrike
 and Aenea simultaneously arrive; the Shrike massacres most of the Pax military units. In the confusion, Endymion rescues Aenea.

Father de Soya pursues Aenea in the Archangel-class courier ship 
Raphael
. The ship's new technology allows 
faster-than-light
 travel without 
time debt
, at the price of a painful death and resurrection during each trip. Aenea convinces de Soya to allow her ship to land on the planet Renaissance Vector. She flies the ship through an ancient farcaster portal, which has been inactive since the Fall of Hyperion. De Soya attempts to disable Aenea's ship, but is too late to prevent it from farcasting.



Traveling through the River Tethys
[
edit
]


The damaged ship arrives on an unknown planet. Aenea and Raul construct a 
raft
 to follow the River Tethys without the ship. De Soya begins an odyssey of continuous deaths and resurrections through all known planetary systems in order to find her.

The next farcaster sends Aenea to the ocean planet Mare Infinitus. They encounter a 
sea platform
 occupied by Pax guards. Raul boards the 
hawking mat
 and goes alone to the platform, taking some 
explosives
 in order to create a distraction. He succeeds, but only after being injured by the Pax and losing the mat. Next, they translate to Hebron. They find the Jewish home planet completely abandoned. De Soya's search brings him to Mare Infinitus, where he finds evidence that Aenea and Endymion have been there. De Soya and his crew are rerouted to Pacem. Cardinal Lourdusamy, the Vatican Secretary of State, assigns Rhadamanth Nemes, part of a new officer corps, to De Soya's guard.



Sol Draconi Septem
[
edit
]


Aenea, Raul and Bettik travel to Sol Draconi Septem, a barely 
terraformed
, frozen, high-
gravity
 planet. They meet and befriend Father Glaucus, an exiled priest, and the Chitchatuk, primitive humans who are adapted to Sol Draconi Septem's conditions. They farcast to Qom Riyadh, an Islamic planet that is now mysteriously uninhabited, and then to God's Grove.

The Pope informs de Soya that Aenea is in Sol Draconi Septem. De Soya translates there, but Nemes does not die during the trip; it is revealed she is not human. Before the other crew members resurrect, she takes a 
dropship
 to the planet. She kills the Chitchatuk and Father Glaucus. She also links to the farcaster and learns that Aenea has gone to Qom Riyadh and will soon head for God's Grove. She plants this new destination in the ship's communicator, but de Soya is suspicious. When they farcast to God's Grove, de Soya secretly gives the ship instructions to resurrect the crew in only 6 hours instead of the safer 3 days.



God's Grove
[
edit
]


Believing that she has three days before De Soya is resurrected, Nemes takes the Raphael's dropship and prepares an ambush for Aenea. As they travel through God's Grove, Aenea shares the truth of what happened to Earth. Earth was not moved by the Technocore, but by an unknown power. She suggests that the Technocore is responsible for the disappearance of the people in Hebron and Qom Riyadh and that it is behind the Church's resurgence and search for them.

When Nemes attacks Aenea, the Shrike appears and blocks her attempts. Father de Soya strikes Nemes from space and allows Aenea to escape. He returns to Pacem to discover the truth about Nemes. Aenea's group passes through a farcaster to reach Old Earth, which is now in the 
Magellanic Cloud
. Aenea guides the ship to 
Fallingwater
, 
Pennsylvania
, and then to 
Taliesin West
, where she will study with a cybrid of architect 
Frank Lloyd Wright

 is Bob Arctor, member of a household of drug users, who is also living a double life as an undercover police agent assigned to spy on Arctor's household. Arctor shields his identity from those in the 
drug subculture
 and from the police. (The requirement that narcotics agents remain anonymous, to avoid collusion and other forms of corruption, becomes a critical plot point late in the book.) While posing as a drug user, Arctor becomes addicted to ""Substance D"" (also referred to as ""Slow Death"", ""Death"" or ""D""), a powerful 
psychoactive drug
. A conflict is Arctor's love for Donna, a drug dealer, through whom he intends to identify high-level dealers of Substance D.

When performing his work as an undercover agent, Arctor goes by the name ""Fred"" and wears a ""scramble suit"" that conceals his identity from other officers. Then he is able to sit in a police facility and observe his housemates through ""holo-scanners"", audio-visual surveillance devices that are placed throughout the house. Arctor's use of the drug causes the two hemispheres of his brain to function independently or ""compete"". When Arctor sees himself in the videos saved by the scanners, he does not realize that it is him. Through a series of drug and psychological tests, Arctor's superiors at work discover that his addiction has made him incapable of performing his job as a narcotics agent. They do not know his identity because he wears the scramble suit, but when his police supervisor suggests to him that he might be Bob Arctor, he is confused and thinks it cannot be possible.

Donna takes Arctor to ""New-Path"", a 
rehabilitation clinic
, just as he begins to experience the symptoms of Substance D 
withdrawal

Without his knowledge, Arctor has been selected to penetrate the organization. As part of the rehab program, Arctor is renamed ""Bruce"" and forced to participate in cruel group-dynamic games, intended to break the will of the patients.

The story ends with Bruce working at a New-Path farming commune, where he is experiencing a serious 
neurocognitive
 deficit, after withdrawing from Substance D. Although considered by his handlers to be nothing more than a walking shell of a man, ""Bruce"" manages to spot rows of blue flowers growing hidden among rows of corn and realizes that the blue flowers are

The novel begins in the 96th year of the Malazan Empire, marking the twilight of Emperor Kellanved's reign. Ganoes Paran, at the age of 12, witnesses the devastating attack on the Mouse Quarter in Malaz City. Paran aspires to become a soldier in the future, despite the veteran soldier Whiskeyjack's reservations.



Genabackis
[
edit
]


Seven years later, the Emperor and his ally, Dancer, have been assassinated and 
supplanted
 by the chief of the 
assassin
 corps. Empress Laseen now rules with the aid of the Claw, the imperial assassins. The story opens several years into a series of wars by the Malazan Empire to conquer the continent of Genabackis.

Under High Fist Dujek, the Malazan 2nd Army has been besieging the city of Pale, one of only two Free Cities left in the Malazans' path in Genabackis, for several years. Pale is holding out thanks to an alliance with the powerful Anomander Rake, Lord of Moon's Spawn (a floating fortress), leader of the non-human Tiste Andii race.
[

]
 Pale finally falls when Rake withdraws his fortress following a fierce battle. Even then, the Empire suffers severe losses, including the near-total destruction of a legendary elite unit in its 2nd army, known as the Bridgeburners. Several characters speculate that someone higher up within the Empire may be engineering the elimination of various people who were loyal to the late Emperor.

The Empire then turns its attention to the last remaining Free City, Darujhistan. A handful of surviving members of the Bridgeburners, led by Sergeant Whiskeyjack, now severely reduced in rank after Laseen's seizure of power, are sent to try to undermine the city from within. Once there, they attempt fruitlessly to contact the city's assassins' guild, in the hope of paying them to betray their city, but Rake has already driven the guild underground. Adjunct Lorn, second-in-command to the Empress, is sent to uncover something in the hills east of Darujhistan. She is accompanied by Onos Toolan, a T'lan Imass, an 
undead
 race that once dominated the world before humans. Meanwhile, Tattersail, one of the few mages to survive the Siege of Pale, and Paran, now a Captain and the Bridgeburners' nominal commander, head toward the city to determine the reason for the increased involvement of several gods and other magical forces in the campaign.

A group of con-artists and underworld figures within Darujhistan work to oppose members of the civic government who are considering capitulating to the Empire. Meanwhile, Anomander Rake offers his alliance to the true rulers of Darujhistan, a secretive 
cabal
 of mages. The plots collide when Adjunct Lorn releases a Jaghut Tyrant, a powerful ancient being, with the aim of either damaging Anomander Rake seriously or forcing him to withdraw from the city. The Tyrant is eventually imprisoned inside an Azath House after a fierce battle with Rake's people, while Rake himself defeats a demon lord that Lorn releases inside the city.

A substantial subplot involves a young Bridgeburner named Sorry. She is known as a cold-blooded killer but is in fact possessed by Cotillion, also known as the Rope, a deity and patron of assassins. When Cotillion's partner Shadowthrone and Rake negotiate the Rope's withdrawal from the events of war, Sorry is freed and falls in with Crokus, a young Daru thief. Crokus has earned the patronage of Oponn, the twin Gods of Chance, who continue to meddle in the conflict for their purposes. As the novel ends, Crokus, a Bridgeburner sapper named Fiddler, and the Bridgeburner assassin Kalam volunteer to take Sorry (now called Apsalar) back to her homeland of Itko Kan (their story continues in 
Deadhouse Gates
).

Meanwhile, Dujek and Whiskeyjack lead the 2nd Army into rebellion against Laseen's increasingly tyrannical rule. Dujek now seeks an alliance with Rake and other enemies of Malazan against a 
holy war
 called by the Pannion Seer, whose empire is advancing from the south-east of Genabackis. Elsewhere, it is confirmed that the continent of Seven Cities has begun a mass uprising against the Empire. These and other plot developments are continued in the third novel,

The first character introduced is a man called Paul Jonas, apparently an 
infantryman
 on the 
Western Front
 of the 
First World War
. In what he at first believes to be a dream or hallucination, he meets a woman with wings, who gives him a feather. He wakes from the experience to find himself back in the trenches, but realizes the experience was not a dream when he discovers the feather. Two of his comrades, Finch and Mullet, begin to express doubts about his sanity. Eventually, Paul runs off into no-man's land. There, he finds the bird-woman but Finch and Mullet have pursued him, and they have been transformed into monstrous shapes: Mullet is grossly fat and Finch has no eyes. Paul flees in terror and falls through a hole in space. He discovers himself in a place similar to the chess-land in 
Lewis Carroll
's 
Through the Looking-Glass
, where he is caught in the battle between the red and the white, as well as hunted by Finch and Mullet. He escapes with a young boy he met at an inn, whose name is Gally. They find themselves on Mars, which is inhabited by creatures who demand a sacrifice of a princess from the planet Venus each year. He recognizes the chosen woman as the winged woman he met earlier, but he cannot remember when he met her. His memory does not even extend to his time in the chess-land. With the help of other men from Earth, he rescues the princess, then flees from the angry Martians. He sees Mullet and Finch again, however, and tries to escape in a hijacked airship. He loses control of the airship and finds himself in a conservatory with a harp, which shrinks to the size of his palm. Mullet and Finch confront him, demanding that he give them the harp, but he refuses and appears again on the airship, which is hurtling toward the ground. Transported to yet another world, he is rescued from a frozen river by a group of 
Neanderthals
, and a voice comes from the harp, telling him that friends will search for him on the river.

The story moves to the late 21st century. The most significant technological change is the wide availability of 
virtual reality
 interfaces among all parts of society. The internet has been replaced by ""the Net,"" a vast network of online VR environments. In 
Durban
, a VR programming instructor named Irene ""Renie"" Sulaweyo is teaching a 
Kalahari San
 named !Xabbu how to create such environments, while providing for her family. Her family is made up by her alcoholic father Long Joseph and her ten-year-old brother Stephen. Stephen spends much of his time online and frequently joins his friends in escapades to forbidden areas of the net. When he somehow ends up in a coma after visiting a forbidden club, she and !Xabbu decide to investigate. Inside the club, they discover a number of very unsavoury entertainments, and are very nearly trapped by the managers. Their most bizarre and horrifying discovery is a very powerful hypnotic entity, which Renie nearly dies trying to escape from. Convinced that the club is set up to damage the minds of children, as it has done to Stephen, she resolves to stop the people responsible. She finds an unusual and large piece of code, in the form of a golden diamond, on her machine, and consults her friend and mentor, Dr. Susan van Bleeck, about it. As they examine it, it erupts into an image of a golden city, then disappears. Renie's difficulties multiply, as it becomes clear that her investigations have earned her powerful enemies: she is stood down from her job and unknown persons set fire to her family's apartment complex. Finally, van Bleeck is brutally assaulted and dies after leaving Renie and !Xabbu with three names: Martine Desroubins, Blue Dog Anchorite, and Bolivar Atasco. The first two are hackers that agree to help them find the golden city, which is in a mysterious network called ""Otherland"", while the third is an anthropologist and archaeologist whose expertise is pre-Columbian Latin America. Blue Dog Anchorite reveals himself to be Murat Sagar Singh, a retired programmer who worked on the security system for Otherland, and whose colleagues on the same project have been dying in unusual circumstances. He also reveals that Otherland was commissioned by a secret organisation called ""
The Grail Brotherhood
"", and that Atasco, who oversaw the security project for Otherland, was an important member of that organisation. Renie, !Xabbu, Martine, and Singh plan to break into Otherland; Renie and !Xabbu, along with Long Joseph and van Bleeck's assistant Jeremiah Dako, travel to Wasps' Nest, a mothballed military base in the 
Drakensberg
 mountains, where there is equipment allowing Renie and !Xabbu to stay connected to the Net for extended periods. Preparations completed, they hack into Otherland, but Singh is confronted and killed by the security system. He is later found dead in his room from a heart attack. Renie, !Xabbu, and Martine manage to enter Otherland and make their way to the golden city, which is called Temilún. There, they meet the God-King, who reveals himself to be Atasco.

In suburban California, a 
terminally-ill
 teenager named Orlando Gardiner has become the most celebrated warrior in Middle Country, an online 
VR
 
MMORPG
 based on swords-and-sorcery. However, while playing the game, he is distracted by a vision of a golden city and killed by a low-level monster. With the help of his friend, Sam Fredericks, he begins to investigate. Their investigations lead to TreeHouse, an online fringe community, and to Melchior, a code name used by Singh and others. Following the trail, they are mysteriously taken to a beach on a river. Across the river, they can see the golden city. They build a raft to cross the river, but are stopped by the police and taken to the palace of the God-King.

On an army base in 
North Carolina
, the young girl Christabel Sorensen becomes friends with Mr. Sellars, a mysterious old man living on the base. She is unaware that he is under house arrest, and her father, a senior military security officer, is in charge of guarding him. She helps him to escape from his house into a network of tunnels lying underneath the base.

The Grail Brotherhood emerges as a small number of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people who have formed an exclusive society. Otherland is their private network, where many of them own numerous simulation worlds (others being leased out for very large sums), and they intend to use it for even more mysterious purposes. They meet in a simulation based on ancient Egypt, where their leader, Felix Jongleur, appears as 
Osiris
 and obliges other members to present themselves as various 
Egyptian deities
. Jongleur commissions an employee, John Dread, to carry out a task referred to as the ""Sky God Project."" Dread promises to accomplish his mission, although it is not stated what exactly he must do.

Renie, !Xabbu, Martine, Orlando, Fredericks, and four other people in similar situations find themselves imprisoned in a virtual reality world so complex that it rivals reality. There, they meet Atasco and his wife, and learn that Atasco, though formerly a member of the Grail Brotherhood, has been uninvolved for some time (though he has been permitted to retain his simulation world), and is now secretly opposing the Brotherhood's plans. They meet the enigmatic Mr. Sellars, who tells them that the network is somehow built from the minds of catatonic children worldwide, and he calls upon the small group of adventurers to stop the Grail Brotherhood.

Before they can get their questions answered, however, the meeting descends into chaos. Unknown to any of those gathered, Dread and a team of expert assassins have attacked the Atascos' island home in Colombia, and Bolivar and his wife are suddenly murdered. Sellars gives the adventurers some brief instructions: they are to search along the river for Paul Jonas, who is at large within Otherland's many simulation worlds, then he too vanishes. Even as the adventurers flee Temilún, Dread, with the help of criminal hacker Dulcie Anwin, hijacks the simulation body of one of their party. The group sails down the river, hoping to find the answers that will enable them to free the children from Otherland's hold."

Main article: 
Hyperion Cantos


The Hegemony is an interstellar governmental entity formed by many planets, most of which are connected by instantaneous 
farcaster
 portals. Some worlds, like Hyperion, have no farcaster portals and are sparsely settled; they are known as the ""Outback"". The farcasters are created and managed by the TechnoCore, an AI civilization. While the Core's physical location is unknown, they interact with humans through various virtual realities.

The Hegemony is opposed by the Ousters, genetically modified humans that fled the Hegemony's growing influence even before Earth was destroyed. The Ousters have mutated physically, believing that they should adapt to their outer-space surroundings rather than adapt the surroundings themselves. They have rarely fought full-scale conflicts with the Hegemony but are currently launching an invasion of Hyperion.



Severn's narrative dreams of the pilgrims
[
edit
]


Joseph Severn, the name assumed by a second John Keats AI persona, has dreams of the pilgrims on Hyperion. He reports these dreams to Hegemony 
CEO
 Meina Gladstone, allowing the government to have real-time access to information about the pilgrims.

Father Hoyt is killed by the Shrike. The Consul leaves to retrieve his ship from Keats. Father Hoyt's body is resurrected into Father Paul Duré. Silenus goes to the Poets' City to complete his Cantos, but is surprised by the Shrike and impaled on the Tree of Pain. Lamia is also attacked by the Shrike and loses consciousness. She awakens in one of the TechnoCore's computerized realities, in the company of Johnny. Lamia and Johnny converse with an AI named Ummon, which reveals some of the motivations of the TechnoCore and the existence of a war between human and AI ultimate intelligences. Johnny is killed by Ummon, and Lamia is released.

The Shrike appears and takes Kassad through a portal. Moneta explains that the Shrike can be controlled by one who defeats it in single combat. Kassad agrees to fight the Shrike. He is transported to a future Hyperion where the planet is desolate and without an atmosphere. All that remains is the Tree of Pain, the tombs, and hundreds of Shrikes. Vowing to save the victims impaled on the Tree, Kassad charges.

At the Tombs, Het Masteen reappears. Before dying, he reveals that the Shrike Cult has colluded with the Templar Brotherhood, and claims that he was meant to pilot the Tree of Pain through space and time. Shortly thereafter, Father Duré disappears. Minutes before the time of Rachel's birth and the simultaneous opening of the Time Tombs, Sol offers her to the Shrike, who carries her into the Tombs.



Severn's actions
[
edit
]


Meina Gladstone positions Severn as a member of her staff. Gladstone is informed that the Ousters have counterattacked, attacking the WorldWeb itself in an unprecedented and unexpected move that appeared impossible. Since FORCE fleets have been committed to the Hyperion system, the first wave of worlds threatened by the Ouster invasion seems destined to fall. As sudden Shrike Cult uprisings devastate major Hegemony planets, Severn travels to Pacem and encounters Father Duré, who had been transported to Pacem by the Shrike. Intrigued by the collusion of the Templar Brotherhood with the Shrike Cult, Duré travels to God's Grove, which is soon to be attacked by the Ousters. Severn and Gladstone's chief of staff, Leigh Hunt, attempts to farcast to 
Tau Ceti
 Center. Instead, they arrive on a world that is an apparent replica of Old Earth, on the way to Rome, the place of the original Keats's death. Like the original Keats, Severn dies of 
tuberculosis
 while the Shrike keeps watch outside, preventing Hunt from leaving with Severn until his physical form dies; his persona retreats into the TechnoCore.



Conclusion
[
edit
]


The Consul meets with the leaders of the Ouster Swarm and learns that the Ousters are not responsible for the attack against the WorldWeb. The TechnoCore is the only power capable of launching such an attack. The Consul tells Gladstone the truth about the attack. Admiral Lee sends a transmission showing an 
autopsy
 on a supposed Ouster from their battlefleet, but the body destroys itself by consuming itself in the same manner as the Core cybrids do, confirming the intel that the supposed Ouster attacks are really Core attacks. The only Ouster swarm attack is the one on Hyperion. Through a dream, Severn tells Gladstone that the TechnoCore resides completely within the farcaster system. They fear other intelligences found in the Void Which Binds, another dimension through which the farcaster portals pass. Gladstone orders the immediate destruction of the farcaster network. General Morpurgo leads a ship supposedly on its way to Hyperion with a Core 
deathwand
 technology designed to kill any human on the surface and all of the Ouster swarm. Instead, the General and his son release the deathwand while the ship is in the farcaster network, saving Hyperion. The WorldWeb disintegrates; mass chaos and riots ensue. Gladstone allows herself to be killed by the rioters, as partial penance for the suffering she caused. The fatline, which utilizes the Void Which Binds for faster-than-light communication, is suddenly shut down by unknown forces.

On Hyperion, Lamia frees Silenus and destroys the Shrike through an unknown power. Rachel appears outside the Time Tombs as a young woman, carrying her infant self. She explains that she is Moneta and is traveling back in time with the Shrike under orders from humanity's future. Sol enters the portal to raise the infant Rachel in the far future.

Several months later, the worst of the chaos caused by the Fall has abated. The novel ends with the Consul returning to the former Web Worlds in his starship to discover what happened, with Severn's personality stored in his ship. Lamia is seven and a half months pregnant with Keats's child, who is named by the Severn personality as ""The One Who Teaches."""

Cover of the 1988 
Bantam Spectra
 paperback edition. Cover art by Jim Burns.


A series of brutal murders soon begins to panic the Budayeen, and Audran is almost executed by Friedlander Bey, who at first considers him to be the killer. He is then forced by the centuries-old Bey to become his investigator, and even worse, is made to subject himself to extensive, partly experimental 
cybernetic modifications
; an advanced form of the brain wiring he has dreaded before.

While the killer or killers brutally begin wiping out witnesses as well as acquaintances of Audran, he tries to uncover clues to their nature and to the link between the seemingly unconnected victims. The killer uses ""moddies"" to make himself into one of the most feared and bestial 
serial killers
 of history.

After being accosted by and overpowering the modified killer — who had begun stalking Audran himself with sadistic glee and patience — he is not convinced that everything is over, and finds that an important middleman in the Budayeen was behind some of the murders. When he confronts him, he is almost killed himself, and facing death, has to insert a special ""daddy"" which makes him go into a bestial frenzy, killing the murderer. However, in his rage, he also slaughters a captured policeman and 
mutilates
 both bodies horribly.

The gruesome nature of his self-defense disgusts his former acquaintances in the Budayeen. Friedlander Bey, in the final move sealing Audran's fate, then forces him to become one of his lieutenants to serve as a new middleman between the Budayeen and the police. As a result, Audran is viewed with suspicion by everyone and ends the novel with practically no friends."

The Confederacy, a massive space empire, duplicates the personality of its best agent and implants it into four brain-dead hosts. These hosts are sent to the four planets of a penal colony, the Warden Diamond, to investigate an alien threat and assassinate the four lords of the planets, the ""Four Lords of the Diamond."" The original agent is on a picket ship and downloads information from his copies.

A copy of the agent wakes up in the body of ""Cal Tremon,"" a criminal on a prison ship heading to Lilith. He must then adapt to Lilith, a beautiful tropical world where its Warden Organism, a symbiotic microorganism, destroys all non-Lilith material, making modernization very difficult. Thus, the several million inhabitants of Lilith's feudal society are serfs. The nobility of Lilith are the few who can control the organisms.

The agent thus finds himself a serf, with no hope of advancing unless he harnesses the power of the Warden Organisms. When a girl he liked was being taken away for experimentation, he taps into his Warden powers and kills the overseer, a petty tyrant.

While living in the Castle, the residence of the Duke, Cal gains some initial training and knowledge. He escapes when he learns that the nobles plan to kill him.  Outside of the castle walls, he gains a secure status in Lilith's society and no longer desires to serve the Confederacy.

Instead, he realizes that the Lord of Lilith, Marek Kreegan, a former Assassin of the Confederacy, cooperates with the aliens to preserve peace and order. Cal learns that Kreegan dissuaded the aliens from a genocide against humanity, choosing the slower course of subversion and sabotage instead.  Cal does not kill Kreegan.  His girlfriend, believing that Kreegan's death would will elevate Cal to Lordship, kills Kreegan by using a potion to draw on Cal's power.

The Agent wakes up in the picket ship, worried about his duplicate's behavior in Lilith."

In the near future, a race riot results in the destruction of an area just outside Los Angeles. The city sells the construction rights to a private company, who then construct an 
arcology
, named Todos Santos, to which control of the area and legal jurisdiction was 
ceded
. The higher standard of living enjoyed by Todos Santos residents causes resentment among Angelenos.  The arcology dwellers have evolved a different culture, sacrificing privacy – there are cameras (not routinely monitored) even in the private apartments – in exchange for security.  The residents are fiercely loyal to the arcology and its management, and the loyalty runs both ways.  During the course of the novel, Todos Santos is compared to a 
feudal society
, with loyalty and obligations running both ways, hence the title of the novel. The systems at the arcology are run by MILLIE, an advanced computer system, and some high-level executives have direct links to MILLIE via bio-electronic 
implants
 in their brains.
[

]
 Other workers in the arcology work by 
telepresence
, including one woman who remotely operates construction equipment on a 
lunar base
.

Todos Santos causes resentment among Angelenos, but has improved their lives as well.  The company that owns the arcology tows icebergs in, solving the water shortage for all Southern Californians. Todos Santos has dug a Los Angeles subway using a digging machine, which uses an 
oxyhydrogen
 torch. Todos Santos is at the hub of the subway system, and contains a huge mall, which Angelenos may visit.  This easy access causes Los Angeles' city officials to complain about the shopping dollars and tax revenues going outside the city limits.

As the story opens, three young Angelenos sneak into the maintenance areas of Todos Santos.  When they are detected by Todos Santos' security systems and personnel, they give every appearance of being terrorists, including spoofing the correct electronic access codes.  When non-lethal means of stopping the three fail, Deputy Manager Preston Sanders orders lethal gas released rather than risk the disastrous consequences of a bomb going off.  Two of the intruders are killed.  They turn out to be youths, with high tech equipment and boxes with such labels as ""bomb"", but without the actual means of harming the arcology.  It soon turns out that they were duped by the ""Friends of Man and the Earth Society"" (FROMATES), anti-technology zealots who want to see Todos Santos destroyed or abandoned, as a means of forcing the arcology to turn off its lethal defenses for a later real attack.

The deaths of the two youths cause political problems.  Sanders is charged with murder.  While arcology manager Art Bonner is quite prepared to defy the city authorities, Sanders turns himself in.  The arcology is forced to turn off its lethal defenses as the FROMATES planned.  When that happens, they soon face a full-fledged attack by the FROMATES, which they deter by non-lethal means, until the intruders prove they have deadly weapons, at which point Todos Santos security responds in kind, shooting and killing most of the intruders.  While city authorities are still reacting to this, the arcology launches a jailbreak, the idea of chief engineer (and resident genius) Tony Rand. They tunnel under the jail using the tunneling machine that the ""Saints"" used to build the L.A. subway, release sleep gas into the jail, and free Sanders.

Los Angeles soon retaliates with arrest and search warrants, but they are soon defeated by the sheer size of the arcology and the ability of the Todos Santos executives, aided in part by their direct links to MILLIE, to hide Rand and Sanders.  After Todos Santos shows that it can cause Los Angeles trouble, such as by contaminating the Los Angeles water supply with salt water, and by work stoppages among the telepresence operators, a truce is arrived at: Rand and Sanders will leave the country permanently, and relations between Los Angeles and Todos Santos will be restored. In effect, Todos Santos has won, if only by restoring the 
status quo ante

Ahmed Bazargan (an 
Iranian
) leads the team of diplomats who descend to the planet World. On his team are Dieter Gruber, a 
geologist
; Ann Sikorski, a 
xenobiologist
; and David Campbell Allen III, a 
graduate student
 in xenology. Their mission is to learn as much as possible about World, the Worlders and their culture, particularly the peculiar phenomenon of shared reality, which causes ""head-pain"" to those holding, or in the presence of someone holding, views contrary to the majority. This has had the drawback of limiting science, technology and progress; Worlders, though a far older 
species
 than Terrans, are somewhere around the 
Renaissance
 in terms of its technology. Bicycles are the cutting edge in personal transportation, each produced by 
artisans
 and individual 
craftsmen
. On the other hand, there has never been a war on World; even the average barroom brawl causes intense head-pain. World's religion focuses on flowers; they believe that their people were created by the First Flower, which descended into the Neury Mountains, and much of their ceremony, both religious and every-day, involves blossoms. The sacredness of the mountains themselves is maintained by a 
wasting sickness
 inflicted on any who enter it.

The Terran contingent was delivered by the 
Zeus
, a warship in the rather piecemeal Solar Alliance Defense Network.  The diplomatic mission is merely a cover story for the military objective, which is headed by 
Colonel
 Dr. Syree Johnson (ret.), a soldier and military 
physicist
. The true objective involves ""Orbital Object #7"", one of World's seven 
moons
 (known as ""Tas"" by the locals). It is in very low orbit, is clearly artificial, and was created by the same unknown 
progenitor
 race that created the space tunnels. Johnson's mission is to analyze Orbital Object #7, decipher its use, and discover if it can be used as a weapon. Whether it can or not, it is about nine times too large to fit through the tunnel, and Johnson and her team can think of no way to safely disassemble it.

Orbital Object #7 has fourteen bumps on the outside, each labeled with a number of their own dots: one, two, three, five, seven, eleven, and thirteen. The ancient builders' love for 
prime numbers
 is well-known; the space tunnels are marked with primes as well. It is theorized that the bumps are activating studs, and manipulating both bumps of one integer (they are on opposite sides, to avoid accidental activation by, say, a passing 
meteor
) will trigger the artifact. When Orbital Object #7 is tested on setting one, it sends out a spherical wave that causes all nearby material higher than 
atomic number
 75 (
rhenium
) to go 
radioactive
—not by irradiating them with energy, but by manipulating the heretofore-untouchable 
strong nuclear force
. Johnson and her team are still deciding what to do when a Faller scout craft (a ""skeeter"") emerges from Space Tunnel 438. The 
Zeus
 attempts to engage using 
particle beam weaponry
, specifically a directed 
proton
 weapon, and are shocked when the beam passes through it instead of destroying it. (This has nothing to do with the strength of the weapon; proton beams utilize particles accelerated to a high percentage of the 
speed of light
. Were the skeeter to land a shot on the 
Zeus
, she would be destroyed as thoroughly as if vice versa. The advantage of a larger ship like the 
Zeus
 is in higher-ranged weaponry: it attacks the skeeter hours before the Faller can counterattack.) Johnson comes up with a theory that the proton beam is subject to the 
Heisenberg
 
uncertainty principle
, and is simultaneously composed of waves and particles until it is ""observed"" by someone - specifically the ship it shoots - at which point it resolves into a stream of particles and destroys whatever has just observed it. Evidently, the Fallers have discovered a way to alter the beam's ""phase complex"" to prevent the beam from resolving; essentially, the skeeter chooses not to ""observe"" the proton beam and is thus unaffected by it. The skeeter, having thus proven that ignorance is bliss, performs a close fly-by of Orbital Object #7 and then departs.

On World, Bazargan struggles particularly with David Allen, who is entranced by the forced 
altruism
 of shared reality and wishes to splice it into the human genome. He also liaises with the head of a rich trading family, Hadjil Pek Voratur, who sees plenty of chances for 
profit
 in the Terrans' advanced technology. He and his team, especially Pek Sikorski, are generally attended by Enli Pek Brimmidin, a household servant who picks up English with surprising speed. Enli, a 
point-of-view
 character, is a spy in the employ of the ""Reality and Atonement"" branch of World's government; her task is to gather information that will shed light on the question of whether Terrans are ""real""—that is, subject to shared reality. This is not an idle concern: those few Worlders who are born without the ability or cannot socialize to it are quietly euthanized. Enli herself has been declared unreal, having murdered her brother, and has been assigned this task as atonement. Bazargan and Ann Sikorski eventually strike a bargain with Voratur, trading the secrets of 
antihistamines
 (for Worlders, 
flower-sickness
 is sacrilegious) for a chance to perform a ""Lagerfeld"" 
brain scan
 on him. They agree only after Voratur takes a dose of antihistamine himself (having commissioned Enli to steal it) and survives.  One of the Worlders testing the first batch of home-made drug dies from it. The Lagerfeld scan is unable to pinpoint a specific place in the Worlder brain where shared reality nests, and Ann concludes that it did not evolve and is not genetic; David Allen refuses to believe this, and begins to suspect a conspiracy between Bazargan and the high priests of World.

Aboard the 
Zeus
, Johnson and the other crew make the decision to push Orbital Object #7 out of orbit and towards Space Tunnel 438, in the hopes of breakthroughs during the five-day journey. She informs Bazargan of the action, including that, if necessary, they will destroy the artifact, possibly creating a destabilizing wave that could affect World. Bazargan goes to inform Voratur of this, only to have Voratur discover that Bazargan did not know that his mission was a cover story. This is binding proof: Terrans do not share reality. Their lives thus endangered, the Terrans, along with Enli, flee to the Neury Mountains, where no one will (or can) follow them. They are protected by environmental suits from the radiation, but they are still subject to a bizarre phenomenon: a slowing-down of the brain, a neurological phenomenon that only Enli remains unaffected by. Deep in the mountains, Gruber discovers a second alien artifact, similar to the one found in space but much smaller (perhaps 25 meters in diameter). It appears to have crash-landed on the planet millions of years ago (precipitating a 
mass extinction
) and is putting out prodigious amounts of 
radiation
. However, the radiation field is in the shape of a 
torus
 (a 
doughnut
), and when the team moves into the ""hole"" of the field, Enli is not afflicted with the head-pains normally associated with unshared reality. Gruber theorizes that the field they passed through alters 
probability
; this allows it to have an effect on human 
brain tissue
 because the release of 
neurotransmitters
 is a quantum-level event and thus susceptible to probability (indeed, 
nerve cells
 do not always release neurotransmitters, even when stimulated with exactly the same amount of voltage).

Speeding towards Space Tunnel 438, the 
Zeus
 is confronted by a Faller cruiser, and detaches from the artifact, which continues on at over 4,000 kilometers per second.  The engagement is largely inconclusive until Orbital Object #7 actually enters the tunnel. Just prior to this, Dr. Johnson receives a transmission from the diplomatic team containing Gruber's theories on the probability field, and realizes that this could explain the Fallers' new shield. However, her speculation is short-lived; when Orbital Object #7 enters the tunnel and is subsequently destroyed by it, it fires off a destabilizing wave at its maximum setting (revealed in the sequel 
Probability Sun
 to have a range of about 6 billion kilometers, and to somehow be not susceptible to the 
inverse square law
), which destroys the 
Zeus
 as well as all Faller craft, irradiates an outer planet in the World system, and then proceeds onward to World itself.

David Allen abducts Enli and drags her out of the mountains, passing through sections of high radiation to do so. Enli, wearing one of the team's four e-suits, is protected, but David takes thousands of 
rads
. (Back with the team, Ann speculates that David is suffering from 
grandiose
 
paranoid schizophrenia
). The two then descend back down to civilization, where they proclaim to be real and explain that a ""sky sickness"" is coming. David teaches Worlders the proper techniques to shelter against radiation, and, having proclaimed his reality by dying for the sake of others, convinces the Worlders that Terrans 
do
 share reality. Meanwhile, Bazargan, Dieter and Ann receive the final transmission from the 
Zeus
 (having traveled 54 light-minutes to reach them), only to discover that Dieter's artifact reacted to the destruction of Orbital Object #7 
when it was destroyed
, once again implying macro-level entanglement. World is ultimately unaffected by the destabilizing wave, for reasons that are not revealed until the sequel. Armed with new hypotheses, the team is retrieved by Terran forces a few days later."

Like many of Pohl's novels, this opens in a world reduced by a crisis, in this case the loss of 
fossil fuels
.  
Solar power
 is a major, albeit insufficient, source of power.  Electricity is metered and cut off if a home exceeds a maximum amount of usage.  ""Power piggery"", the profligate use of electricity, is a crime.

The Rev. H. Hornswell ""Horny"" Hake becomes embroiled in ""the Cool War"", in which each country tries to sabotage the economies of its rivals, even if politically they are allies.  For instance, he is put in charge of a party of schoolchildren touring Europe.  The children are, however, carrying a virulent flu-like disease that affects only adults aged between 30 and 50, the ""prime of life"" individuals who tend to run businesses and government in industrialized countries.  As a result, industrial production in Europe falls drastically.  The group who created the infection is known only as ""The Team"" and is composed of former agents of the CIA and other organizations.

However the War has produced a group of people who profit by its continuation and can suppress technologies that might solve humanity's problems.  In particular a new form of solar energy collection relies on bio-engineered ""sunflowers"" which, while technically plants, have extremely reflective petals and can be trained to focus light from a wide area on a furnace or power generator.  The Team is determined to destroy the technology because it was invented outside the United States.  Hake has to recruit his friends, and some of his enemies, to prevent this and expose the Team to the world."

The main character, ten-year-old Hubert Anvil, is a chorister at St George's Basilica, Coverley (real world 
Cowley
), for whom tragedy beckons when his teachers and the 
Church
 hierarchy, all the way up to the 
Pope
 himself, decree that the boy's superb voice is too precious to sacrifice to 
puberty
. Despite his own misgivings, he must undergo 
castration
, one of the two 
alterations
 of the title. Insight into this world is offered during Anvil's abortive escape from church authorities, with references to alternative world versions of known political and cultural figures. Hubert's mother carries on an illicit affair with the family chaplain, and his brother, Anthony, is a 
liberal
 dissident from repressive church policies.

In this timeline, there are two pivotal divergences from known history. 
Arthur Tudor
 and 
Catherine of Aragon
's short-lived union produced a son, Stephen II of England. When 
Henry of York
 (""the Abominable"") tried to usurp his nephew's throne, there was a papal 
crusade
 (the ""War of the English Succession"") to restore the rightful heir, culminating in the ""Holy Victory"" at Coverley, which was designated as the ecclesiastical capital of England.

Secondly, the Protestant Reformation did not take place as 
Martin Luther
 was reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church and later became 
Pope Germanian I
. Luther's 
anti-Semitism
 may have infected this history to a greater extent during his papacy,
[

 as the novel discloses that 
Jews
 are forced to seclude themselves and wear 
yellow stars
 to advertise their religious and ethnic identity. In this history, 
Thomas More
 did not marry, and ascended to the Papacy as 
Pope Hadrian VII
.

While the Papacy still holds sway across 
Western Europe
, in this version of the twentieth century Protestantism is limited to the breakaway Republic of 
New England
, which includes such locations as Cranmeria (named after 
Thomas Cranmer
), Hussville (named for 
Jan Huss
), Waldensia (
Waldensians
) and Wyclif City (
John Wycliffe
). The head of the 
schismatic
 church in New England is the 
Archpresbyter
 of Arnoldstown (named after 
Benedict Arnold
). 
Joseph Rudyard Kipling
 held office as ""First Citizen"" from 1914 to 1918, while 
Edgar Allan Poe
 was an acclaimed general who died at the moment of his victory over the combined forces of 
Louisiana
 and 
Mexico
 in the war of 1848–1850. We learn towards the end of the book that this Protestant state also has unpleasant features, such as practising 
apartheid
 towards 
Native Americans
 and a harsh penal system.

England dominates the British Isles with 
Ireland
 being called ""West-England"" and 
Scotland
 being annexed to England as ""North-England"". Instead of 
parliamentary democracy
, the English Isles are administered by a 
Convocation
 of clergy accountable to the Catholic hierarchy. The rule of the Church is absolute and totalitarian, controlled by the Holy Office, a sort of 
KGB
 or 
Gestapo
 equivalent. (Monsignors Henricus and Laurentius – 
Heinrich Himmler

The state of the world is illustrated in a description of national, clerical and royal figures at the funeral of Stephen III, late King of England, which opens the book. There is reference to the Kings of 
Portugal
, 
Sweden
, 
Naples
 and 
Lithuania
, which suggests that no Italian nation-state exists in this history due to the temporal strength of the Papacy. The Crown Prince of 
Muscovy
 is also mentioned, suggesting that Tsarism holds sway, and the 
Dauphin
 leads one to conclude that the French monarchy is also still in existence. 
Germany
 is a nation-state, known as Almaigne and ruled by an Emperor, although it may not have exactly the same national boundaries. The ""Vicar General"" of the ""Emperor Patriarch"" of Candia  suggests that the 
Greek Orthodox Church
 survives as a separate ecclesiastical jurisdiction, albeit exiled from its native 
Greece
 (which is still under 
Ottoman domination
) and with its headquarters in 
Crete
. Finally, this opening section cites the ""Viceroys"" of India, 
Brazil
 and 
New Spain
, suggesting that 
colonialism
 and direct 
imperialism
 are still realities here.

A Christian/
Muslim
 
cold war
 exists between the Papacy and the Ottoman Empire. Described as a war against an opponent that can never be destroyed and which can be held in check only by maintaining permanent armies and fleets, it serves the useful purpose of distracting any tendency to rebel or question. 
Pope John XXIV
 is a 
Machiavellian
 Yorkshireman, who allows the cold war to heat up as a 
Malthusian
 plot to resolve Europe's 
population growth
 – the church has access to 
bacteriological warfare
 as an alternative to 
birth control
, whose prior papal prohibition John XXIV opposes. The book's coda, set in 1991, fifteen years after the events of the main body of the book, reveals that events have turned out as the Pope planned. Europe's surplus population has become cannon fodder for the war, which ended in a narrow victory although the 
Ottoman Empire
 got as far as 
Brussels
. However, one of Hubert's childhood friends, Decuman, is mentioned as being among the occupation troops in 
Adrianople
 in far western 
Turkey
, suggesting that the Ottomans either lost the war, or at least were forced to make significant territorial concessions to the Catholic West.

William Shakespeare
's work was suppressed in this history, although 
Thomas Kyd
's original text of 
Hamlet
 has survived, and is still performed in 1976 (albeit only in New England). 
Shelley
 lived until 1853, at which point he set fire to 
Castel Gandolfo
 outside 
Rome
 and perished. By contrast, 
Mozart
, 
Beethoven
, 
Blake
, 
Hockney
 and 
Holman Hunt
 have allowed their talents to submit to religious authority. Edward Bradford argues that the choice of authors and musicians here is not meant to imply Amis's own preferences, but questions the value of art subordinated to a destructive ideology that represses 
sexual freedom
 and human choice.

Edward IV is on the throne of England, but in this world, 
medieval Europe
 is dominated by the threat from the 
Byzantine Empire
. During the 4th century CE, 
Julian the Apostate
 reigned longer than he did in our world, succeeded in displacing Christianity and reintroduced religious pluralism within the Roman Empire, resulting in the subsequent disappearance of 
Islam
 as well. Without any cohesive threat from the east, presumably Byzantium was able to survive, consolidate its authority and expand.

Sforza, the Vampire Duke, marshals his forces for his long-planned attack on Florence, and Byzantium is on the march. Gregory, a mercenary; Dimi, the exiled heir to the Byzantine throne; Cynthia, a young physician forced to flee Florence; and Hywel, a Welsh wizard, nephew of 
Owain Gly Dwr
, seem to have no common goals but together they wage an intrigue-filled campaign against the might of Byzantium, striving to secure the English throne for Richard, Duke of Gloucester, and make him Richard III.

This succeeds, and Richard III goes on to win the 
Battle of Bosworth
 in this alternate universe, killing Henry Tudor and ensuring that he never becomes 
Henry VII
 as he did in the reality. At that point, the book ends."

By the 21st century, the 
Moon
 has been colonized, and although still very much a research establishment, it is visited by tourists who can afford the trip. One of its attractions is a  cruise across one of the 
lunar seas
, named the 
Sea of Thirst
, (located within the 
Sinus Roris
) filled with an extremely fine dust, a fine powder far drier than the contents of a terrestrial desert and which almost flows like water, instead of the common 
regolith
 which covers most of the lunar surface. A specially designed ""boat"" named the 
Selene
 skims over the surface of the dust in the same manner as a 
jetski
.

But on one cruise, a 
moonquake
 causes a cavern to collapse, upsetting the equilibrium. As the dust-cruiser 
Selene
 passes over, it sinks about 15 metres below the surface of the dust, hiding the vessel from view, and trapping it beneath the dust. Immediately there are potentially fatal problems for the crew and passengers inside. The sunken 
Selene
 has a limited air supply, there is no way for heat generated to escape, communications are impossible, and no one else is sure where 
Selene
 has been lost. As the 
Selene
 heats up and the air becomes unbreathable, young Captain Pat Harris and his chief stewardess Sue Wilkins try to keep the passengers occupied and psychologically stable while waiting to be rescued. They are helped by a retired space ship captain and explorer, Commodore Hansteen, who is initially traveling incognito.

Chief Engineer (Earthside) Robert Lawrence is sceptical that a rescue can be mounted, even if the 
Selene
 can be located. He is ready to abandon an initially unsuccessful search, when he is contacted by Thomas Lawson, a brilliant but eccentric 
astronomer
 who, from his vantage point on a 
satellite
 high above the Moon, 
Lagrange II
, believes he has detected the remains of a heat trail on the surface. An expedition is organised and Lawrence indeed makes contact with the 
Selene
. However the completely alien environment results in numerous unforeseen complications. The rescue mission decides to sink a tube supplying oxygen to the 
Selene
 first, in an effort to buy time to think of a way to get the passengers out. However, this becomes a race against the clock, as the heat in the 
Selene
 knocks out the chemical air purification system and the passengers are suffering from 
CO
2
 poisoning
. To preserve air, most passengers enter a chemically induced sleep, with only Pat Harris and physicist Duncan McKenzie staying awake. Just in time, the rescuers manage to drill a hole in the roof and deliver an air supply.

A plan is hatched to save the passengers of the 
Selene
 by sinking several concrete 
caissons
 to the roof of the ship and cutting a hole. When the first caisson is sunk, disaster strikes again: the liquid waste of the passengers had been expelled out of the ship, turning the dust around it into mud, which causes another, smaller, cave-in. The 
Selene
 sinks once more, this time only a small distance, but crucially, at a slope. The caissons cannot be connected to the roof which is now sloping at 30 degrees. The air supply and communications have also been damaged. After restoring these latter two, a new plan is made to sink the caissons, but now the bottom one has a flexible fitting attached to it which can be mounted to the sloping roof of the 
Selene
. The rescue mission works according to plan: the caissons are sunk, the dust is scooped out and the connection is made, but now time is running out again. When the air supply holes were drilled, 
Selene'
s double hull was breached and the space in between slowly filled with dust. The metal-rich dust reached the battery packs and short-circuited them. This causes the battery compartment in the stern to burn slowly. The resulting breach is barricaded by the passengers, but dust is still pouring in and there is a fear that the burning material will cause the 
liquid oxygen
 supply to explode. Meanwhile, Robert Lawrence is working in the rescue shaft: he sets a small 
ring charge
 to make a hole in the roof. Just in time, the hole is made and the passengers escape through the shaft. Captain Harris is the last to leave, up to his waist in dust. Just when he is clear of the shaft, the liquid oxygen explodes, destroying the 
Selene
.

A short 
epilogue
 sees Lawrence writing his 
memoirs
, Pat Harris and Sue Wilkins are married. Pat Harris is the captain of the 
Selene II
 on its maiden cruise which will also be the last cruise for Harris as he is hoping to transfer to the space service."

 Cowboy, one of the protagonists, is a smuggler who can control an armored hovertank using a neural interface. The other protagonist, Sarah, is a prostitute turned mercenary assassin; she and Cowboy end up teaming up to fight the Orbitals.

Ex-fighter pilot Cowboy, ""hardwired"" via skull sockets directly to his lethal electronic hardware, teams up with Sarah, an equally cyborized gun-for-hire, to make a last stab at independence. Cowboy is hired by a Russian named Arkady to transport medicine across ""The Line"" while Sarah takes a seduction and assassination job for an Orbital agent named Cunningham. Both of them find themselves betrayed by their employers and soon are forced into hiding, driving them together.

Romance blooms between the two as Cowboy makes arrangements with an old colleague named Reno to try to take off some of their cargo to give them spending money. Reno is promptly assassinated by the Orbitals, making their situation worse. Cowboy decides to try to strike at the corporation behind their troubles, Temple Pharmaceuticals, while Sarah decides to make a second deal with them.

Sarah finds her hospitalized brother, Daud, has been seduced by an agent of the Orbitals and is feeding them information by them. Sarah attempts to betray Cowboy and his people but has a last minute change of heart that results in her being barely able to escape with the help of Reno, the deceased smuggler surviving inside the internet as an AI. Reno is seeking Black Mind technology that will allow him to overwrite the mind of a cybernetically enhanced mind to live again. It was created as a weapon against the Orbitals but never deployed.

Cowboy and a monstrous TP executive, Roon, inflict immense damage on the company's finances via stock manipulation but cannot do enough to overthrow its current leader, Couceiro. Cowboy sets up a last ditch plan to shoot down a space ship carrying medical supplies that will restore TP's stock value. Daud betrays their location to the Orbitals and most of Cowboy's people are killed. Cowboy manages to shoot down the ship while Cunningham commits suicide after his mercenaries are killed. Cowboy manages to survive, though, and Roon takes over as CEO of TP with Couceiro ""banished"" to Earth.

Roon attempts to blackmail Sarah and Cowboy into working for him but is then killed by Reno, who overwrites his consciousness and replaces him. Sarah and Cowboy are left with no enemies and a very powerful new friend.

Thomas Jericho, a 
paleontologist
 working at the 
Royal Ontario Museum
 in 
Toronto
, 
Canada
 makes the first human-to-alien contact when a ""Forhilnor"", a 
spider
-like alien from the third planet of the 
Beta Hydri
 system arrives on 
Earth
 to investigate Earth's evolutionary history. The alien, Hollus, has come to Earth to gain access to the museum's large collection of 
fossils
, and to study accumulated human knowledge in order to gather evidence of the existence of 
God
. It appears that Earth and Hollus' home planet, and the home planet of another alien species traveling with Hollus, all experienced the same five 
cataclysmic
 events at roughly the same time. Hollus believes that the universe was created by a god, to provide a place where life could develop and evolve. Thomas Jericho is an 
atheist
 who provides a balance to the philosophical discussion regarding the existence of gods.

At the end, the star 
Betelgeuse
 goes 
supernova
, threatening all life within hundreds of 
light-years
 with 
radiation
.  One of several dead civilizations discovered by the explorers may have deliberately induced the 
supernova
 in order to 
sterilize
 the stellar neighborhood. This was presumably done in order to protect the 
virtual reality
 machinery which now housed all of their planet's personalities. According to a theory of Thomas's, several worlds exist where the inhabitants uploaded themselves into machines instead of exploring the nature of the universe and gods.

Although the supernova explosion occurred over 400 years before the events of the novel, the radiation is first reaching 
Earth
 at the present time due to its distance from Earth. However, the alien ship's advanced 
telescope
 in 
orbit
 then sees a large black entity emerge from space itself and cover the exploding star.  This is final proof that a controlling intelligence is guiding and preserving some life-forms in the universe.

In the final chapter, the scientist, who is dying of 
cancer
, travels to the entity on the alien ship, where a 
fusion
 of 
genetic
 materials from human and alien sources produces a new life form that the aliens conjecture will create the next cycles of the universe."

Decades prior to the book's opening, a magical race known as the Seerkind combined all of their powers to create a secret world known as ""the Fugue"", a carpet into which they wove their most beloved locations, animals, possessions and themselves as a safe haven. Their aim was to avoid persecution by humans (who call them demons and 
fairies
) and eradication by a destructive being known as the Scourge. This creature's nature is entirely unknown to the Seerkind, as no-one has survived to describe it. The Fugue, resembling an ordinary, albeit exquisitely woven, carpet is left in the care of a human woman, Mimi Laschenski, who married one of the Seerkind and resides in 
Liverpool
, England.

Mimi reaches old age and is hospitalised following a stroke. A young man named Calhoun Mooney, chasing an escaped homing pigeon, accidentally glimpses the Fugue hidden in the carpet, which profoundly affects him. Simultaneously, Mimi's granddaughter Suzanna Parrish arrives in the city at Mimi's behest. The mystery surrounding Mimi and the full potential of the carpet brings Cal and Suzanna together and quickly into confrontation with the primary antagonists: Immacolata, an exiled and extremely powerful member of the Seerkind bent on revenge; Shadwell, a human salesman with limitless ambition; and Hobart, a conscientious policeman.

Cal and Suzanna acquire new allies and abilities in their goal of protecting the Fugue from destruction, venturing into it themselves twice. When Shadwell's actions result in the Fugue's seemingly total obliteration, the surviving Seerkind scatter. In a last desperate attempt to finish them, Shadwell locates and awakens the Scourge, which begins systematically destroying any and all traces of magic it can find.

Cal, Suzanna and their remaining allies make a final stand against Shadwell by using his own tactics against him and convince the Scourge to abandon its cause and leave the world in peace. In the aftermath, a severely traumatised Cal is cared for by Suzanna whilst their friends adjust to permanent life amongst humanity. Eventually, Cal emerges from his withdrawal with the knowledge that the Fugue is still in existence and can be restored to its full glory."

The book focuses on several key events that happen after Nafai, Elemak, Issib, Mebbekew, Zdorab and the father Volemak leave for the desert. Elemak has a dream from the Oversoul, foretelling Volemak's sons going back to the city of Basilica to get wives. The sons proceed to Nafai's and Issib's mother, Rasa, who is attempting to keep order within the city. However Hushidh, a raveler (one who can see, and manipulate ties between people) under Rasa's care, makes the disastrous mistake of severing the ties between Rashgallivak and his men, leading to widespread riots across the city.

At the same time, General Moozh, leader of the ""Wetheads"" nation (Gorayni), is attempting to conquer cities around Basilica. He sees a strategic chance, and taking only 1000 soldiers, marches across the desert to conquer the city. He arrives in time to help the local city guard quell the uprising, and slowly begins taking control of its affairs.

The remainder of the book deals with Nafai and his brothers' (Elemak and Mebbekew, who had come) attempts at finding wives. In the end, they are all forced into a house arrest along with Rasa, where Elemak takes Eiadh as his wife, Mebbekew takes Dol, Nafai takes Luet, the waterseer, with Rasa and Hushidh deciding to come as wives for Volemak and Issib, respectively. Shedemei (a Basilican geneticist) is dragged along with enough plants and animals to populate the future earth with new species, also as a wife to Zdorab.

The ending comes when Moozh decides to marry Hushidh to politically tie himself with the city. Hushidh's original mother arrives to stop the ceremony, since Hushidh is actually the daughter of Moozh. Nafai's party is escorted out of the city with the women and supplies for the camp.

Moozh ends up conquering the ""Wetheads"" he had been working for, while his Basilican second-in-command defends the city against the rival nation, Potokgavan. In the end he is killed during an invasion and Basilica falls, scattering the citizens to various other nations and cities on Harmony. Earlier in the book, the Oversoul had revealed the purpose of this dispersal was to force people with a strong connection to it to breed with people who had a weak connection, and so delay the eventual time when the Oversoul loses control of the people of Harmony."

In the aftermath of a devastating nuclear war, Americans have come to blame technology for the disaster, and far from seeking to recover what was destroyed, are actively opposed to any such attempt.  Religious sects which even before the war opposed modern technology have adjusted to the post-apocalypse situation far more easily than anyone else, and have come to dominate the post-war society. All the pre-war American cities have been destroyed in the war, and their re-construction is expressly forbidden. The 
US Constitution
 has been amended, with the Thirtieth Amendment disallowing the presence of more than a thousand residents or the existence of more than two hundred buildings per square mile anywhere in the United States.

Len Colter and his cousin Esau are adolescent members of the New Mennonite community of Piper's Run. Against their fathers' wishes, the boys attend a preaching where a trader named Soames is stoned to death for his apparent involvement with a forbidden bastion of technology known as Bartorstown. They are saved when a trader, Ed Hostetter, intervenes. Hostetter grabs a box from Soames' wagon, from which Esau steals a radio.  Though sickened by the stoning and harshly punished by their fathers, Len and Esau are fascinated by the idea of a community that secretly still harnesses the forbidden technologies. Len's grandmother, a little girl at the time of the destruction, sparks his interest in the technological past with her stories of big, brightly lit cities and little boxes with moving pictures.

Esau and Len begin to work the radio, trying to make 'noise' come out of it. Esau steals three books from the schoolhouse in the hope that they would teach the boys to utilise the radio. The two are punished harshly after Hostetter outs them as thieves. The radio is smashed by Esau's father in rage, and Hostetter demands his wagon be searched lest he be accused of being a member of Bartorstown. Esau is whipped and Len's father is visibly disappointed. Subsequently, Esau and Len become determined to find their way to the fabled Bartorstown and leave Piper's Run in search of it, following broken dialogue heard over the radio towards a river.

The boys make their way to a town called Refuge, living with Judge Taylor and his family and working for a warehouse owner, Mike Dulinsky. Esau starts a romantic relationship with the judge's daughter, Amity Taylor. Dulinsky wants to build a fifth warehouse to compete economically with the town on the other side of the river, Shadwell. However, this would violate the Constitution's Thirtieth Amendment as the number of buildings would exceed two hundred. He rallies the Refuge residents, who initially pledge their support, but Judge Taylor warns Len and Dulinsky of the consequences and that he would go to the state authority. The Judge eventually betrays Dulinsky to the Shadwell residents. The Shadwell residents double-cross the Judge, kill Dulinsky and set fire to Refuge.

Len, Esau and Amity are saved by Hostetter, who is revealed to be an actual member of Bartorstown. Previously, he had to out Esau as a thief to conceal his own identity. Len is let down when Hostetter's ship turns out to be a coal-powered steamship, though eventually understanding it was for concealment. Hostetter wishes to settle in a place like Piper's Run, but is unable to do so. They make a long journey to Bartorstown, a place called Fall Creek Canyon. Hostetter remarks that even those who set foot in Bartorstown do not know it is 
the
 Bartorstown, as the scientific facilities were buried, and Fall Creek Canyon resembles any ordinary settlement. Before the journey is complete, Len begins to think of Hostetter as a father-figure, the latter reciprocating that sentiment.

In Fall Creek, Amity and Esau are wed, while the three are sworn to secrecy and are told they will be shot if they attempt to leave. The town's leaders seek to use the childlike vision that Len and Esau had of Bartorstown to inspire the workers, who have been working for a long time without an end in sight. Len becomes romantically tangled with Joan Wepplo, who possesses a red dress. Joan, in contrast to Len, has resented her upbringing in Bartorstown and seeks to leave, though the residents of Bartorstown are unable to.

The scientists of Bartorstown have been working on a long-term project with an artificial intelligence, Clementine, aimed at creating a forcefield that would eradicate the splitting of atoms, preventing future misuse of nuclear technology. They feed Clementine equations in the hope of creating the ultimate equation to produce the forcefield. Len is shocked to find that Bartorstown relies on nuclear power, conflicting with his religious beliefs that the devilish nuclear power which annihilated society should be abstained from entirely. The community's rationalisation that others would eventually unlock the lost secrets of nuclear technology and that it would be better to take preventive measures does not sit well with Len and his religious upbringing.

Len and Joan, now married, plot an escape from Bartorstown, and the two succeed, blending in with tribals to evade Bartorstown's surveillance. Len's journey is painful and he thinks of the long walk back to Piper's Run as his religious redemption. However, they are tracked down by Hostetter. The three sit together in a small town where a preaching is occurring, in similar circumstances where Soames was stoned. Len mentally prepares for himself to die, thinking of Soames and Dulinsky and the disillusioned Bartorstown scientists and acknowledging that change would come around eventually, even if he as an individual passed on. Len gives up the opportunity to out Hostetter as a Bartorstown member to the crowd to be stoned, and Hostetter reciprocates by not outing Len. Hostetter is revealed to have armed backup that would have shot Len and Joan if he had outed Hostetter, but Hostetter reiterates that he knew and trusted Len so long that he never would have needed the backup. Hostetter, Len and Joan then make their way back to Bartorstown."

A human-built device, the Interface project, returns to the Solar System after 1,500 years. The project, towed by the spaceship 
Cauchy
, returns a 
wormhole
 gate, appearing to offer 
time travel
 due to the time 'difference' between the exits of the wormhole (relativistic 
time dilation
), with one end having remained in the Solar System and the other travelling at near lightspeed for a century. The Qax had destroyed the Solar System gate, but a lashed-up human ship (a great chunk of soil including 
Stonehenge
, crewed by a group called the 
Friends of Wigner
) passes through the returning gate, travelling back to the unconquered humanity of 1,500 years ago.

One of the crew of the 
Cauchy
 returns with the Friends, Miriam Berg. The Friends have a complex scheme, which does not include a simple military return-and-rescue – the 1,500-year technology gap makes this ""risible"". From the Wigner 
thought experiment
 they have postulated an unusual theory on the ultimate destiny of life in the universe. They believe that quantum wave-functions do not collapse like the 
Copenhagen interpretation
 holds, nor that each collapse actually buds off separate universes (like the 
quantum multiverse
 hypothesis holds) but rather that the universe is a 
participatory universe
: the entire universe exists as a single massive 
quantum superposition
, and that at the end of time (in the 
open universe
 of the Xeelee Sequence, time and space are unbounded, or more precisely, bounded only at the 
Cauchy boundaries
 of ""Time-like infinity"" and ""Space-like infinity""), when intelligent life collects all information (compare the 
final anthropic principle
 and the 
Omega Point
), it will transform into an ""Ultimate Observer"" and make the ""final Observation"", the observation which collapses all the possible entangled wave-functions generated since the beginning of the universe. They believe further that the Ultimate Observer will not merely observe, but 
choose
 which 
world line
 will be the true world-line, and that it will choose the one in which humanity suffers no Squeem or Qax occupations. However, the Ultimate Observer cannot choose between worldlines if no information survives to its era to distinguish worldlines- if the UO never knows of humanity, it cannot choose a worldline favourable to it. In other words, some way is needed to securely send information forward in time.

As a consequence of this necessity, they intend to turn Jupiter into a carefully formed 
singularity
 and use the precisely specified parameters as a method of encoding information. Miriam Berg is more concerned over the immediate fate of humanity, with the threat of the future Qax, and transmits a 'help' message to the gate designer Michael Poole.

The Qax, naturally, panic a little at the escape to the past. A complex, unavoidably fragile species in their huge living Spline spacecraft, the few Qax present are somewhat at a loss. They decide to build their own Interface, with major human-collaborator assistance (headed by Ambassador Jasoft Parz), to create a link to their future to gain aid in resolving the problem – with more modern 
GUT
-engine spacecraft they can make a 500-year link in just eighteen months. A startling high-technology future vessel (in truth, one of the legendary Xeelee nightfighters, an advanced and long-range fast scout ship), with a future Qax comes through the gate. Its first act is to execute the Qax Governor of Earth and gather up Parz, before passing through the original portal after the Friends and all humanity. The future Qax takes two Spline ships (presumably leaving behind the nightfighter; this might be the nightfighter that is discovered by the crew of 
The Great Northern
 millennia later in 
Ring
) through the gate and on the journey reveals to Parz the reason behind its desire to completely destroy the human race.



The Ring
[

The future Qax tells Parz that over the centuries, the Qax had worn down humanity through constant oppression, and had eventually decided to eliminate its space-faring capabilities. But before they did, as economical traders, they wished to get as much value out of their human pilots as possible. So certain pilots were dispatched on a number of dangerous or quixotic missions.

One such pilot was a man named Jim Bolder. The Qax had come into possession of a Xeelee nightfighter, and had modified it to support human control. Bolder's mission was simple: go to the 
Great Attractor
, the cause of most 
galactic drift
, and find out why and how it exists. Bolder travelled to the bottom of the gravitational well, and found the Ring. A 
torus
 a thousand 
light-years
 in diameter, constructed of an unknown substance, rotating at a large fraction of 
lightspeed
. The Qax goes on to speculate that the torus created a 
Kerr metric
, and that it allowed egress from the current universe, that it was in effect an escape route for the Xeelee. Before Parz, the Spline warship, and the Qax exit the wormhole, the Qax asks, ""What do Xeelee fear, do you suppose?"". Regardless, Bolder escaped the Great Attractor and returned to the Qax home system, where he was supposed to be taken into custody by dozens of Spline warships wielding gravitational-wave based ""starbreakers"" and his priceless data on the god-like Xeelee's ultimate project secured. Bolder either did not, or somehow escaped; in the ensuing fight, the starbreakers were accidentally fired at the Qax system primary star, and true to their name, destabilised it, causing it to go 
nova
. The Qax were forced to hurriedly evacuate. Many died, and the power of the Qax trading empire (and by extension, their Occupation of Earth) ended.



Defeat
[

In the past, Poole joins Berg on the Friend vessel shortly before the Qax emerges, having travelled aboard his ship, 
Hermit Crab
, from the 
Oort cloud
. He is accompanied by a Virtual of his father, Harry. Together they elude the control of the Friends, whose project fails under the bombardment of the Spline's starbreaker beam. Miriam Berg commandeers the singularity cannon used to sculpt Jupiter and fires a pair of black holes into the Spline, which merge and disable it. Meanwhile, aided by Jasoft Parz's internal sabotage, Poole succeeds in ramming the 
Hermit Crab
 into the second Spline, killing the sapience of the vessel and the entangled Qax, second Governor of Earth, with it. Harry takes over in lieu of the higher intelligence and, at the direction of Poole, steers it back into the wormhole: when inside, Poole intends to activate the hyperdrive, shattering the fragile dimensional warping of the wormhole, and of all wormholes connecting to it, thus saving humanity from further interference by the future.

Poole's audacious plan succeeds, but with an unexpected side effect. As the hyperdrive activates, it somewhat shatters space-time, forming a long series of interconnected wormholes that hurl Poole 5 million years forward into the far future.  Poole discovers a sad cosmos, in which the stars are guttering out; the Friends were wrong- intelligent life would not triumph and remake the cosmos, eventually leading to their Prime Observer.

His ship shattered and broken, Poole begins dying, but at the last moment, an ""anti-Xeelee"" (whom it is implied is a being created by the Xeelee to be like them, except travelling like a 
tachyon
 backwards in time, the better to mould the Xeelee's early evolutionary history) takes a liking to Poole, and converts him into an intangible immortal being of ""quantum functions"". In this form, Poole travels the universe, but out of boredom, eventually begins to lapse into a quasi-coma- until an unexpected event occurs: a savage in a glass box, having travelled through a wormhole like Poole himself. ""History resumed."" (This final event is one of the early plot points of the 
Ring
.)

Van is recruited into a nascent wing of the government, working on the outside of the main bureaucracy to vastly improve the security of government systems.  His ingenious design gains him even more respect from his peers, but as the project continues Van goes through personality changes, becoming more paranoid and simultaneously more patriotic.  Without the psychological aid of the money and nice house of his former company, he even begins to question whether he really is a computer scientist or just an over-glorified technician.

The novel comes to a head as Van is asked to look into the reason a multibillion-dollar pork project spy satellite is failing in space.  The bureaucracy, thinking that he will fail in this endeavor, hopes to use it to discredit his boss and him and put an end to their power climb in Washington.  Van discovers the problem and through a covert military-like attack on the source, puts an end to it."

A young Chinese-American girl, whose parents run a laundry in a magical Los Angeles, resolves to become a movie star. Achieving stardom, in this Hollywood, involves a literal 
apotheosis
 that grants immortality. After a series of bit parts for the director Jacko Dewalt, she blackmails him to meet the studio executive Oberlin Wolfe. To avoid revealing her real name (and thus making herself magically vulnerable), she takes her sister's name, Luli. 

Luli joins Wolfe's 
studio system
, on the condition that her roles will include ""no maids, no funny talking, no fainting flowers."" These conditions limit her career. She befriends her roommate in the studio dorms, a kidnapped 
Skogsrå
 named Greta. She also begins a romance with the more-established actress Emmaline Sauvignon. Greta falls in love with Wolfe's protégé Brandt Hiller, whom Wolfe intends to sacrifice in that year's ritualistic 
Wild Hunt
, through which Wolfe feeds a dangerous ancient power. Eventually, Luli lands a major role as a 
siren
. She befriends her famous co-star Harry Long, who reveals to her his secret relationship with a man. Luli's siren movie is a hit, as is its sequel. Greta (now pregnant) and Luli rescue Brandt during the Wild Hunt, and he and Greta escape to Sweden. Emmaline rejects Luli, angry that she drew Wolfe's negative attention. 

Two years later, Luli's initial contract with Wolfe is nearly over. While filming the third siren movie, the set catches fire and Harry disappears; he is declared dead. Luli connects with the 
butch
 Tara Lubowski at a lesbian bar. Jacko is brought on to direct a hasty re-envisioning of the siren film without Harry in the lead. As Jacko's revenge on Luli for her long-ago blackmail, the film now ends with the siren begging pathetically for her life. Luli is initially angry that Tara (under a male pseudonym) has written this degrading ending, but after she and Tara get to know each other better, they begin a romance. Filming the climactic death scene of her siren, Luli achieves magical stardom. She re-signs with Wolfe from a position of power.

The epilogue is narrated from Luli's perspective as a celestial star in the present day, reflecting on the legacy of her long career and her romantic relationships."

The second is the first-person narrative of Madison Yazoo Leake, a soldier in the 
United States Army
 and a member of the ""Special Group"" being sent back in time to 1930s Louisiana in an attempt to stop the destruction of the human race in a

The only member of his team to arrive at this destination, he soon establishes contact with a group of mound-builders who gradually befriend him.

The final narrative is based on the diary entries of 
Warrant Officer
 Smith, another member of the Special Group. She arrives with the rest of the team of military and 
CIA

Blackout
 is set several decades after the 
zombie apocalypse
, the Rising. Kellis-Amberlee is a normally beneficial virus that, on the death of any host mammal over 40 pounds (18 kg), ""goes live"" or ""amplifies"", and turns them into a 
zombie
. Most humans reside in controlled zones, and 
blogs
 are now the primary source of news and entertainment. The novel is written from the perspectives of Georgia and Shaun Mason, siblings and blogger-reporters. Over the preceding books, they, along with their colleagues at the After The End Times website, have uncovered a widespread conspiracy. The 
Centers for Disease Control
 (CDC), the agency responding to the zombie virus and responsible for public health and safety, is actually creating new 
substrains
 (culminating in a 
mosquito-transmitted variant
 released at the end of 
Deadline
), killing off those developing 
immune responses
 (including Georgia, who was assassinated during the events of 
Feed
), and frustrating research into a cure.

Shaun Mason, having discovered his immunity to the virus, is helping with Dr. Abbey's zombie research while hiding out from the CDC with the rest of the After the End Times team: Rebecca Atherton, Mahir Gowda, Maggie Garcia, and Alaric Kwong. Dr. Abbey tasks Shaun and Rebecca with travelling to zombie-infested Florida and recovering live mosquitoes for study, but when they head back to 
Berkeley, California
 to meet with Shaun's adoptive parents, they are lured into a trap and barely escape the CDC. Disheartened, Shaun and Rebecca head north to Seattle, where Maggie and Mahir have contacted the identity forger, the Monkey. He agrees to help them disappear with new identities if they help steal information from the Seattle CDC facility. The team, minus Maggie, breaks in and set up a remote-access 
Wi-Fi hotspot
, but their escape is hampered by a security alert.

After dying, Georgia awakens as a prisoner in a CDC facility and quickly concludes that she is a 
clone
. With the help of 
Epidemic Intelligence Service
 (EIS) undercover agents, Georgia learns she is a 97 percent match to the mind of the original Georgia and is intended as a ""showroom model"" for resurrection through cloning. She also discovers she is in Seattle, and other Georgia clones have been created, including a less mentally accurate but more compliant version for use against Shaun. The agents use a week-long sleep study as a cover to remove trackers and self-destruct devices implanted in Georgia's body, but a 
mole
 exposes the EIS team. Georgia escapes and takes the security alert as an opportunity to destroy the other clones.

Shaun, seeking an exit, runs into Georgia, fleeing her improvised explosives. They link up with Rebecca and Mahir, and escape to meet Maggie at the Agora luxury hotel. Although initially reluctant to accept Georgia's existence, her mannerisms and knowledge of Georgia's life, including an (only apparently incestuous) relationship between Georgia and Shaun, gradually convince the group that she is a real, accurate clone. They go to see the Monkey but are betrayed by one of his subordinates. A CDC squad attacks the location: the Monkey and his people are killed, and Maggie is wounded. She is left at the Agora for treatment, and the team heads back to Dr. Abbey's lab, where an EIS agent is waiting to transport them to Washington, D.C.. They are taken to the 
White House
 by Rick Cousins (former After the End Times journalist, now Vice President of the United States) to meet President Peter Ryman, who is being coerced to continue the conspiracy.

The CDC has found a cure for Kellis-Amberlee, but the cure destroys the 
immune system
 so instead, they have focused on engineering the virus to prevent natural immunities from developing, while taking measures to ensure they remain in power. While Shaun, Becks, and Alaric are briefed on (and secretly recording) the 
party line
 by a CDC scientist, Rick takes Georgia aside to explain the situation before they, with help from the EIS and the Secret Service, ""kidnap"" Ryman. The CDC initiates an outbreak inside the White House, during which Rebecca sacrifices herself to hold back the horde while the others escape. The survivors head to an EIS facility, where Shaun and Georgia help Ryman address the world, while Mahir orchestrates junior members of After the End Times to upload supporting evidence and blow the conspiracy wide open. As the world comes to terms with the revelations, the EIS takes over the CDC, while Georgia and Shaun head to the wilds of Canada to escape the limelight."

Three generations after the departure of the 
Peerless
 from the home world, the ever increasing population (which can't be controlled due to spontaneous reproduction) overstreches its limited capacities. For a drastic solution, newborns are euthanized. The long mission of research is continued in the meantime: Tamara, an astronomer, studies an object on a course close to the 
Peerless
 and plans to dispatch the spacecraft 
Gnat
 to it. Carla, a physicist, studies light and finds a seemingly perfect ratio of five to four in one of her experiments. It has already been discovered that Nereo's equation (corresponding to the 
Maxwell equations
) makes wrong predictions. She conducts further experiments with her students to gather more data. Patrizia, one of these students, later goes over the mathematics of collisions and comes up with the hypothesis of 
quantization
 for particles of light, later known as Patrizia's principle (corresponding to the 
Planck relation
). She proposes luxites as names for the 
quanta
 after the luxagens causing them and an already proposed idea by an ancient philiosopher without evidence. Carla renames them into 
photons
 to avoid confusion. First surprised by the ingenious idea, which explains the data and in which an integer number of photons is necessary to give the luxagens enough energy to leave an energy valley, she soon notices some problems. She had studied wavelengths for which four or five photons carry enough energy and now wants to conduct new experiments for which six are necessary.

Carlo, a biologist, measures signals used by animals and himself to shapeshift their bodies. Previously it has been discovered through coloring, how their flesh can end up in different parts of their limbs during this process, giving rise to the question about how the ever changing communication with the brain works. Special attention is given to the signals by males to initiate reproduction. There are two kinds of species, where the females either divide in two or four children (biparteous and quadruparteous, latter of which is their own species). Carlo intends to measures those signals and swap them, potentially transferring the division into only two children artificially to their own species, solving the population crisis. Their way of reproduction also poses a problem to Tamaro, the co of Tamara and therefore supposed to trigger hers, who doesn't want her to go on board the 
Gnat
 and hence risk the lives of their children. Together with their father Erminio, he imprisons Tamara and spreads news about her having given birth on the 
Peerless
. Tamara can persuade Tamaro with a deal to let her go free and later joins the mission on the 
Gnat
 with Carla and Ivo. They cause an almost fatal detonation for them near the Object, pushing it on an almost parallel course with the 
Peerless
, It turns out, that the thermodynamic arrow and the arrow of entropy decrease of the Object point in the opposite directions and hence contact of any matter from the 
Peerless
 with the Object would again result in a detonation.

Carlo travels through the forest section inside the 
Peerless
 to catch the four arborines (two pairs of cos) for experiments. He then records the light signal of Zosimo when triggering the splitting of Zosima in two children and then sends it into one half of Benigna to mimick Benigno triggering her splitting. Benigna sheds a single female child and survives the birth injured. A successful experiment on their own species could turn the next election around, but time is running out. When this achievement is made public on the 
Peerless
 some males, fearing their upcoming extinction, set the entire forest on fire. Tamara, not wanting them to have the last word with violence, but knowing about the fatal consequences of Carlo's last experiment, agrees to have the arborine signal transmitted into a part of her body. She also sheds a single female child, who she named Erminia after her mother, and survives injured. Message of the birth is made public and swings the vote around, making the new technology available for every female choosing it and hence solving the population crisis.

Carla revisits some of the newly discovered physics and is saddened by the fact, that her legacy will ultimately only be to have taught Patrizia, whose name will go down in history with Patrizia's principle. She does some sketches involving an atom with three different orbitals as well as the emission and absorption of photons, one of which is reflected by a moving mirror to change its frequency, and finally realizes to just have come up with a process to make the eternal flame possible. Some time later, the space probe 
Eternal Flame
 is dispatched into space to demonstrate the engine indeed working, solving the fuel crisis. Some others, including Tamara and her daughter Erminia, are also watching. Carlo tells Carla to be delighted to have saved her life with his new technology, but she refuses to immediately make use of it, as she rather wants to wait what the new day will bring."

The events of 
Jade City
 take place a generation after the end of the Many Nations War, a conflict roughly analogous to 
World War II
, during which the One Mountain Society, a national liberation movement, successfully fought to end foreign occupation of Kekon. After the war, the One Mountain Society disintegrated into a number of rival clans, with the most powerful being the isolationist Mountain clan led by the Ayt family and the internationalist No Peak clan led by the Kaul family. The clans each have a Pillar, Horn, and Weather Man; the Pillar is the head of the clan, the Horn leads its street fighters, and the Weather Man is responsible for business activities.

Kekon contains the world's only supply of jade, a mineral that endows its wearer with enhanced abilities. Safe use of jade requires a combination of genetic predisposition and intense training in the six jade disciplines. The aboriginal population of Kekon, the Abukei, are completely immune to its effects, while individuals from outside Kekon are too sensitive to it. Only the Kekonese, with mixed aboriginal and settler ancestry, have the necessary combination of resistance and sensitivity to be able to use it long-term. Lee has commented that she tied jade ability to a combination of genetics and luck as ""a way to subvert that trope of the blood talent... the chosen ones.""
[

]
 Kekonese with no ability to use jade are called ""stone-eyes"" and are considered unlucky. The drug SN1, or shine, can be used to increase one's jade tolerance.



Jade City

Bero, a thief, attempts to steal jade from a No Peak Fist. He and his Abukei accomplice Sampa are quickly caught and brought to Kaul Hilo for punishment. Hilo takes the two boys to be questioned in the presence of his brother Lan, the clan Pillar. Hilo attempts to convince Lan that the Mountain clan is squeezing No Peak territory, but he is opposed by Doru the Weather Man, who counsels a peaceful solution. Feeling frustrated and unsupported by Doru, Lan asks his grandfather Kaul Sen for permission to replace Doru, but Kaul Sen refuses to allow it. Lan's sister Shae returns to Kekon from her studies abroad, but she declines to become involved in clan business and refuses to wear her jade.

The Mountain kidnaps Emery Anden, the adopted cousin of Kaul Lan, Hilo, and Shae. Ayt Mada offers Anden a position in her clan, signaling that she wishes to unite the Mountain and No Peak. Once Anden has been returned safely, Lan begins to move against the Mountain. He proposes a new law preventing any one clan from gaining control of the Kekon Jade Alliance, and he sends Shae to audit the KJA's accounts.

The Mountain makes an attempt on Hilo's life. Lan duels a Mountain clan member and is successful. In the aftermath, Hilo asks his brother for permission to marry his girlfriend Wen. Despite his misgivings about Hilo marrying a stone-eye from a disreputable family, Lan gives his permission.

Lan is injured in the duel, but he cannot show weakness by failing to wear the additional jade he has won. He arranges for Anden to bring him packages of shine. When Anden realizes what he is delivering, he pleads with Lan to stop using the drug. When Shae comes to see Anden, he fails to tell her about Lan's drug use.

Shae reports to Lan that someone in the KJA is skimming jade; either Doru doesn't know about it and is incompetent, or he is allowing it to happen. Lan sends Doru overseas to get him out of the way and tells his allies on the Royal Council that he is going to suspend jade production.

Meanwhile, the Mountain tells Bero to shoot up the gentleman's club that Lan frequents. Lan accidentally takes an overdose of shine while visiting the club, and when Bero attacks him he falls into the sea and drowns. When Shae hears about Lan's death, she decides to formally rejoin the clan and put on her jade. She persuades Hilo, the new Pillar, to strike back against the Mountain. Hilo appoints her as his Weather Man; Doru is arrested and placed under house arrest.

Shae and Hilo accuse Ayt Mada of skimming jade from the KJA and supplying it to foreign nations. Ayt arranges to meet Shae on safe ground and tries to talk her into betraying No Peak, but Shae refuses. Wen asks Shae to make her a spy for the clan without Hilo's knowledge. Shae sends her to a foreign military base with a shipment of jade worth millions, re-establishing the supply that has been disrupted by the KJA's suspension of jade production.

Doru defects to the Mountain. Hilo marries Wen, then has Anden drive him into Mountain territory, where he expects to be killed in combat. Together, Hilo and Anden manage to kill Gont Ascht, the Horn of the Mountain. The fight leaves Anden in a coma. When he regains consciousness, he learns that the loss of its Horn has dealt the Mountain a serious blow and given No Peak a temporary advantage in the war. Anden returns to the Academy for his graduation ceremony, but when he is presented with his jade he declares he does not want to be a Green Bone. He tells Hilo he does not want a life of violence, and the Pillar rebukes him publicly.

Later, under cover of darkness, Bero visits Lan's grave. He is still looking for jade, and in the former Pillar's coffin there is a generous supply.

Nigerian agent Kaaro uses his psychic powers to investigate a mysterious alien dome and deaths linked to it. 

In 2012, an alien named Wormwood appears in London, substantially altering the world's geopolitical landscape. In the 2050s, it creates an impenetrable dome in Rosewater, Nigeria. It exudes a fungus called xenoforms, which interact with human nervous systems. A very small number of humans are able to use the xenoforms to access an information network known as the xenosphere; these humans are called “sensitives”. The life of Kaaro, a sensitive, is presented throughout different decades.

As a teen, Kaaro uses his burgeoning psychic abilities for thievery. He is caught and almost executed. He escapes and begins using his telepathy on the black market before being recruited by the government. In the 2050s, he trains with S45, a secret branch of the Nigerian government. He is tasked with tracking down Oyin Da, an anarchist revolutionary. Kaaro and Da travel to the future site of Rosewater, where they speak with Wormwood. They are followed by S45 agents who shoot at Wormwood, but Kaaro senses the trap and saves him. Wormwood then creates the dome to separate himself from most humans; Da stays within the dome and Kaaro does not.

In 2066, Kaaro is still working for S45. Sensitives begin dying of an unknown illness. He begins seeing a mysterious woman named Molara in the xenosphere. He dates a woman named Aminat. Unbeknownst to Kaaro, she is an undercover S45 agent. Molara reveals that she is of alien origin; she is the embodiment of the xenosphere. The creation of sensitives was an unintended consequence as aliens gathered information about Earth. They no longer need more information, so they are killing the sensitives. She attempts to kill Kaaro, but he is rescued by Wormwood. Kaaro learns that the aliens are replacing human DNA with their own over the course of generations. He and Aminat continue their lives, unsure about how to combat the inevitable end of humanity."

Then strange messages from space aliens are received. Dr. Pat Adcock has a theory that the aliens have taken up the old Starlab space station. Adcock recruits pilots Jimmy Lin and Martin Delasquez, an elderly astronomer (Rosaleen Artzybachova), and close protection agent Dan Dannerman (who is actually a government secret agent).

When they first explore the Starlab, they find strange alien technologies. Then suddenly, they are transported through space. The aliens have kidnapped the group because the aliens, called ""Beloved Leaders"", are battling against a terrorist named the Horch. The aliens are battling for dominance of the ""Eschaton"", which gives eternal life. The humans then learn that they are just copies of their old bodies; their real bodies were sent back to the Earth with wiped memories. Other copies have been experimented on with vivisection."

Six months after leaving Earth, Dee is seething with rage towards the people who ordered the nuclear strike that destroyed Earth. She knows they are aboard-ship, but the way that 
Atlas 2
 is set up, there is no way to contact anyone outside of one's immediate surroundings, nor even know who they are. Other than Dee, the only people who saw the detonation are her best friend, Carl; and Carl’s “sort-of lover,” Travis.

Dee tries to escape her trauma through an immersive game. An unexpected job offer by a designer who asks her help test his new game gives her access to the ship's computer, leading to her also being invited to play elite games. In the game world, she encounters a mysterious guide, who hints that they are there to help her. The game she finds herself in is different than any ""mersive"" she's played before, and she is shocked to learn that a man she killed inside the game has also died in the real world. When she discovered that the man is a member of an elite society also responsible for the destruction of earth, she realizes that she is on the path to discover the truth.

While Carl helps her investigate, her cagey guide performs seemingly impossible hacking feats to block him, while protecting Dee, and also inviting her to take her revenge on the destroyers of Earth.

As 
Atlas 2
 continues its 20-year journey towards the colony established by the first 
Atlas
 ship, she finds out what the plans are for the colony upon arrival, and realizes that to save what is left of humanity, she might have to do something that risks what remains of her own.

The first ship that Humanity sent into interstellar space was the 
Southern Cross
, sent on a four-and-a-half century voyage to 
Alpha Crucis
. On autopilot she accelerated at over one hundred gees until she was flying away from Sol at half the speed of light. Then the autopilot shut down the ion drive, the ship went into free fall, and the first crew went into the mattercaster on Earth's moon to be teleported aboard the ship for their month-long tour of duty. Ten generations later, when she is one hundred light years from Sol, Southern Cross receives her last crew, though the four men who come through the mattercaster do not know that they 
are
 the last crew.

Terangi Maclaren, an astrophysicist of Polynesian ancestry, has convinced officials of the Protectorate, the dictatorship under which he lives, to take a great risk. Previous crews have made observations indicating that 
Southern Cross
 will pass close enough to a burnt-out star that she could be diverted, decelerate, and go into orbit around it in order that the crew can make further studies. The risk comes from the fact that if the crew cannot find a roughly asteroid-sized body to provide feedstock for the mattercaster, the Exploration Authority will not be able to teleport enough mercury to the ship to provide enough propellant for Southern Cross to resume her journey to Alpha Crucis. More playboy than scientist, Maclaren is assigned to the mission he had promoted.

David Ryerson is a graviticist/tachyonicist born and raised in Scotland's Outer Hebrides. He has just married an Indonesian woman, Tamara Suwito, and has brought her home to meet his father, Captain Magnus Ryerson. The couple are preparing to emigrate to a planet just opened for colonization, but Magnus demands that David first serve a tour on the 
Southern Cross
. Reluctantly David agrees, if only for the extra pay.

Seiichi Nakamura lives on Sarai, an Earth-like moon of a gas-giant planet in the 
40 Eridani
 system. He has been selected to serve as 
Southern Cross's
 pilot and captain on this particular tour. Old traumas haunt him and his Zen discipline cannot relieve him of his fear of the dark star.

Chang Sverdlov, on Krasna, one of the planets of 
Tau Ceti
, has been assigned to be 
Southern Cross's
 engineer. Member of a nascent revolutionary movement, he is told to observe anything about the dead star that may be of military value. He is also being sent ""out of town"" to allay suspicions that are beginning to arise regarding his loyalty to the Protectorate.

Maclaren and Ryerson travel from Earth to the moon together and from the moon teleport onto the 
Southern Cross
. On the ship they find Nakamura and Sverdlov waiting for them and the four men immediately set to the tasks necessary to bring 
Southern Cross
 as close as possible to the dead star. As Nakamura backs the ship down, to put its trajectory into a close orbit around the star, the ion drive suddenly begins to vaporize itself and the mattercaster web: they have encountered interference from the star's magnetic field, which is far stiffer than anyone thought possible. In order to avoid crashing into the star Nakamura must fire the drive enough to put the ship into a stable orbit, doing so at the expense of further damage to the drive's ion accelerators and to the mattercaster web.

After making the necessary inspections Sverdlov states that the drive can be repaired well enough that the ship can maneuver around the dead star as they need and Ryerson states that he can repair the mattercaster web only to a certain point. To make a full repair of the mattercaster, so that the men can go home, Ryerson needs four kilograms of pure 
germanium
 in order to build the large and complex transistors that the web needs. Sverdlov and Ryerson go outside to repair the drive and while Nakamura is testing the drive under Sverdlov's directions, Sverdlov slips and falls, breaches his spacesuit, and dies.

Some months later the men find a planet, a ball of nickel-iron alloy a little smaller than Earth. From this planet's material they will extract the germanium that Ryerson needs. But first they must land 
Southern Cross
 on the planet and the ship was not meant to land on a planet. Using material scavenged from the ship's landers and other non-essential items, the three men build a tripod to protect the ion drive and the mattercaster web. Nakamura backs the ship down onto the planet, but one leg of the tripod buckles. Acting intuitively, Nakamura turns the ship to protect the mattercaster, but in so doing he puts the control turret he occupies directly under one thousand tonnes of crash-landing spaceship.

For weeks Maclaren cuts pieces out of the planet's metal surface and Ryerson extracts the little germanium they contain. Even on short rations they are running out of food. They get the germanium they need, Ryerson makes his transistors and finishes repairing the web, and then the two men begin the task of using their uncalibrated mattercaster to find a resonance that will take them to another ship or base, whence they can be rescued.

One day, as they are on the verge of starving to death, they find a resonance. In desperation Ryerson teleports himself to the receiver, leaving the more cautious Maclaren behind. Some time later Maclaren decides to follow Ryerson, but before he can do so Ryerson returns... draped across the arms of an alien wearing a spacesuit full of chlorine.

Some months later, still recovering his health from his ordeal, Maclaren goes to Sumatra to meet Ryerson's widow and give her his few small personal possessions. He tells her that the alien had examined his cobbled-together mattercaster, had located and marked resonances that led to his people's ships or bases, and then teleported back to his own ship. It had taken another week for Maclaren to find the resonance that took him to a human base, whence he was rescued.

Taking Tamara with him, Maclaren flies his aircar to the Outer Hebrides. She points out the house where Magnus Ryerson waits for them. Maclaren has come to tell Magnus about his son and to answer the old man's questions. Tamara's outburst, crying out the uselessness of going to the stars, touches Maclaren's own doubts. But Magnus simply says, ""For that is our doom and our pride,"" quoting from Rudyard Kipling's poem ""The Song of the Dead"". Magnus goes on to read from that poem the stanza that begins, ""We have fed our sea for a thousand years....""

Maclaren understands then and asks Magnus for his blessing.

First published in 
Destinies
, Vol 1, No 2 (Jan 1979), this novelette was first incorporated into 
The Enemy Stars
 in the 1987 Baen Books edition. The story is told in the first person, narrated by Voah, the alien who had brought David Ryerson's body back to the 
Southern Cross
.

Native to Arvel, a planet with a chlorine-rich atmosphere, Voah-and-Rero, husband and wife, had been serving a tour of duty on the starship 
Fleetwing
, also headed toward Alpha Crucis, when David Ryerson teleported into their receiver and died. Voah describes how he-and-Rero made the decision that he would take Ryerson's body back to Southern Cross and how he had helped Maclaren by finding and marking the resonances that led to Arvelan mattercasters.

Now, ten years later, he-and-Rero have come to Earth to participate in the tenth anniversary celebration of that first contact. In the midst of the celebration the Arvelans are taken secretly to Taiwan to meet with Terangi and Tamara Maclaren. The secret trip has been arranged by Vincent Indigo, their guide and general factotum while they are on Earth. Voah-and-Rero hope that in the time they spend with the Maclarens they will gain new insights into the nature of humans as they differ from Arvelans.

During the visit Indigo and three henchgoons invade the Maclaren house and kidnap the Arvelans. When it becomes clear that the kidnappers intend to kill one of them, Voah-and-Rero attack them, killing two of the terrorists and, with the help of Terangi, disabling the other two. Under interrogation Indigo admits that the kidnapping was carried out at the behest of the dictator to convince the Arvelans to withdraw from contact with humans. Voah then decides that he will recommend to his people that they negotiate a treaty that will lead to humans and Arvelans using each other's mattercaster networks."

The story is set approximately 9,000 years in the future (12th millennium AD), after humanity has expanded to inhabit countless worlds. Alex Benedict and his partner Chase Kolpath are antique dealers who run a firm called Rainbow Enterprises.

During the plot, several elements of the future history are disclosed, such as the global Dark Age and the loss of artifacts and records of that time, the 26th century interstellar colonization, and the 4th millennium unification of Planet Earth.

An intriguing artifact (a Corbett transmitter, which allows communications through hyperspace) that dates back to the Golden Age of Spaceflight is found in the home of deceased astroarcheologist Garnett Baylee. The source of the artifact is a mystery as Baylee never announced such a discovery.

While this is happening, the Capella, a cruise spaceship which disappeared over a decade ago, is expected to resurface from hyperspace, possibly leading to the evacuation of the spacecraft. This is significant because Benedict's uncle Gabe was on the Capella.

The novel is set in a distant future when humans are part of an interstellar civilization, the ConSentiency comprising numerous species.  Mysterious and powerful Caleban provide ""jump-doors"" (which allow 
instantaneous travel between any two points in the universe
); this is the glue that holds the far-flung ConSentiency together. Unfortunately, one consequence of the technology is the possibility that large numbers of unsuspecting sentients can be diverted to destinations unknown for nefarious purposes. A government saboteur attempts to expose one such plot.

Jorj X. McKie
 is a 
Saboteur Extraordinary
, one of the principals of the 
Bureau of Sabotage
, and the only human admitted to practice law before the Gowachin bar as a 
legum
 (
lawyer
). Whilst meditating in a park on the grounds the Bureau's headquarters, McKie is mentally contacted by the Caleban Fannie Mae, a nominally female member of a multidimensional species of unparalleled power, who cryptically explains his mission. (Their dialogue has elements of a lover's spat, which is indicative of the depth of their relationship.)

Generations ago, a secret, unauthorized experiment by the Gowachins was carried out with the help of a contract with the Calebans. The planet Dosadi was isolated behind an impenetrable barrier (called ""The God Wall"") and populated with humans and Gowachin. The planet and its biosphere are massively poisonous except for a deep narrow valley containing the city-state ""Chu"", into which nearly 89 million humans and Gowachin are crowded under terrible conditions. The culture of ordinary day-to-day power on Dosadi is hence extremely violent.  At the time of the story Chu is ruled by a dictator. Numerous other governmental systems have been installed by DemoPol, a computer system used to manipulate the populace without its consent or knowledge. Furthermore, addictive drugs are a commonplace method of control.

In this milieu Senior Liator (or Liaitor) 
Keila Jedrik
 begins a war that will change Dosadi, and ultimately the ConSentiency itself forever. Jorj, having been thoroughly but narrowly briefed, arrives ignorant of what possible benefits the Dosadi experiment had been expected to yield. The saboteur and the bureaucrat join forces via ego sharing, and by 
using a hole in the contract isolating Dosadi they escape via jump gate. By further legal manoeuvring the Dosadi population itself is unleashed upon the ConSentiency for good or ill. The Gowachin, having sent McKie to Dosadi in the first place in the hopes of a solution more in keeping with their interests could be found, must deal with the consequences."

Species far and wide compete in feats of song, dance and/or whatever facsimile of these can be performed by various creatures who may or may not possess, in the traditional sense, feet, mouths, larynxes, or faces. And if a new species should wish to be counted among the high and the mighty, if a new planet has produced some savage group of animals, machines, or algae that claim to be, against all odds, sentient? Well, then they will have to compete. And if they fail? Sudden extermination for their entire species. This year, though, humankind has discovered the enormous universe. And while they expected to discover a grand drama of diplomacy, gunships, wormholes, and stoic councils of aliens, they have instead found glitter, lipstick, and electric guitars. Mankind will not get to fight for its destiny—they must sing. Decibel Jones and the Absolute Zeroes have been chosen to represent their planet on the greatest stage in the galaxy. And the fate of Earth lies in their ability to rock."

Convinced that the defeat of America is only a few years away, and equally convinced that the Soviet Union needs a massive external threat to hold it together, to give it purpose and direction, he tells the writers: 'I want you to concoct a story about aliens poised to invade earth ... I want it to be massively detailed, and completely believable. If you need props and evidence to back it up, then we can create them.

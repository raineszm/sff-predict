Q595128,"Suddenly, condemned arch-swindler Moist von Lipwig found himself with a noose around his neck and dropping through a trapdoor into ... a government job? By all rights, Moist should be meeting his maker rather than being offered a position as Postmaster by Lord Vetinari, supreme ruler of Ankh-Morpork. Getting the moribund Postal Service up and running again, however, may prove an impossible task, what with literally mountains of decades-old undelivered mail clogging every nook and cranny of the broken-down post office. Worse still, Moist could swear the mail is talking to him. Worst of all, it means taking on the gargantuan, greedy Grand Trunk clacks communication monopoly and its bloodthirsty piratical headman. But if the bold and undoable are what's called for, Moist's the man for the job -- to move the mail, continue breathing, get the girl, and specially deliver that invaluable commodity that every being, human or otherwise, requires: hope."
Q122452552,"*Shades of Milk and Honey* is an intimate portrait of Jane Ellsworth, a woman ahead of her time in a version of Regency England where the manipulation of glamour is considered an essential skill for a lady of quality. Despite the prevalence of magic in everyday life, other aspects of Dorchester's society are not that different: Jane and her sister Melody's lives still revolve around vying for the attentions of eligible men.

Jane resists this fate, and rightly so, because while her skill with glamour is remarkable, it is her sister who is fair of face, and therefore wins the lion's share of the attention. At the ripe old age of twenty-eight, Jane has resigned herself to being invisible forever. But when her family's honor is threatened, she finds that she must push her skills to the limit in order to set things right--and, in the process, accidentally wanders into a love story of her own.

This debut novel from an award-winning talent scratches a literary itch you never knew you had. Like wandering into a secret picnic attended by *Pride and Prejudice* and *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell*, *Shades of Milk and Honey* is precisely the sort of tale we would expect from Jane Austen...if she lived in a world where magic worked.

Q2759020,"Miles Vorkosigan launches a campaign to win the heart of Ekatarina, whose former husband died as a result of Miles' investigations in the book *Komarr*,  by the same author.  As a member of the Vor class, Miles and Ekatarina are constrained by many social strictures. Because Miles is politically important, he and his actions are under close scrutiny and subject to various forms of political and social attack. The book is a comedy of manners, very well done so that we seldom look up and wonder why the characters don't just cut to the chase."
Q2294155,"""His best book,"" Esquire wrote of Kurt Vonnegut's 1959 novel The Sirens of Titan, adding, ""he dares not only to ask the ultimate question about the meaning of life, but to answer it.""  This novel fits into that aspect of the Vonnegut canon that might be classified as science fiction, a quality that once led Time to describe Vonnegut as ""George Orwell, Dr. Caligari and Flash Gordon compounded into one writer ... a zany but moral mad scientist.""

The Sirens of Titan was perhaps the novel that began the Vonnegut phenomenon with readers. The story is a fabulous trip, spinning madly through space and time in pursuit of nothing less than a fundamental understanding of the meaning of life. It takes place at a time in the future, when ""only the human soul remained terra incognita ... the Nightmare Ages, falling roughly, give or take a few years, between the Second World War and the Third Great Depression.""

The villainous and super rich Malachi Constant is offered a chance to journey into the far reaches of outer space, to eventually live on the planet Titan surrounded by three beautiful sirens. There is the proverbial ""small print"" with this incredible offer, which Constant turns down, setting in motion a fantastic chain of events that only Vonnegut could imagine. The result is an uproarious, freewheeling inquiry into the very reason we exist and about how we participate and matter in the scheme of the universe.

The Sirens of Titan is essential, fundamental Vonnegut, as entertaining as it is questing in search of answers to the mysteries of life.  As a work of fiction, it is a sure leap, in terms of craft, over his first novel, Player Piano. His writing here is pared down, more concentrated and graceful, richly in the service of his remarkable ideas. Vonnegut summons greatness for the first time in The Sirens of Titan, where the search for the meaning of existence looks and sounds like a kaleidoscopic dream but leaves the reader with a clear and challenging answer."
Q3223113,"Cameraman Richard Grey's memory has blanked out the few weeks before he was injured in a car bomb explosion. When he is visited by a girl who seems to have been his lover, his attempts to recall the forgotten period produce an odyssey through France and conflicting accounts of what happened.

Q6725637,"Throughout history, man has been searching for better ways to gather information about his universe. But although they may have longed for it, not even the most brilliant minds could conceive of a device as infinitely powerful or as immeasurably precise as the macroscope, until the twenty-first century. By analyzing information carried on macrons, this unbelievable tool brought the whole universe of wonders to man's doorstep. The macroscope was seen by many as the salvation of the human race. But in the hands of the wrong man, the macroscope could be immensely destructive-infinitely more dangerous than the nuclear bomb. By searching to know too much, man could destroy the very essence of his mind. This is the powerful story of man's struggle with technology, and also the story of his human struggle with himself. This novel takes us across the breathtaking ranges of space as well as through the most touching places in the human heart. It is a story of coming of age, of sacrifice, and of love. It is the story of man's desperate search for a compromise between his mind and his heart, between knowledge and humanity."

Q58221164,"Thousands of years in the future, humanity is no longer alone in a universe where a mind's potential is determined by its location in space, from superintelligent entities in the Transcend, to the limited minds of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures, and technology, can function.

Q3367818,"One of those rare, unforgettable novels that are as chilling as they are insightful, as thought-provoking as they are terrifying, award-winning author Connie Willis's Passage is an astonishing blend of relentless suspense and cutting-edge science unlike anything you've ever read before. It is the electrifying story of a psychologist who has devoted her life to tracking death. But when she volunteers for a research project that simulates the near-death experience, she will either solve life's greatest mystery -- or fall victim to its greatest terror. At Mercy General Hospital, Dr. Joanna Lander will soon be paged -- not to save a life, but to interview a patient just back from the dead. A psychologist specializing in near-death experiences, Joanna has spent two years recording the experiences of those who have been declared clinically dead and lived to tell about it. It's research on the fringes of ordinary science, but Joanna is about to get a boost from an unexpected quarter. A new doctor has arrived at Mercy General, one with the power to give Joanna the chance to get as close to death as anyone can.A brilliant young neurologist, Dr. Richard Wright has come up with a way to manufacture the near-death experience using a psychoactive drug. Dr. Wright is convinced that the NDE is a survival mechanism and that if only doctors understood how it worked, they could someday delay the dying process, or maybe even reverse it. He can use the expertise of a psychologist of Joanna Lander's standing to lend credibility to his study. But he soon needs Joanna for more than just her reputation. When his key volunteer suddenly drops out of the study, Joanna finds herself offering to become Richard's next subject. After all, who better than she, a trained psychologist, to document the experience? Her first NDE is as fascinating as she imagined it would be -- so astounding that she knows she must go back, if only to find out why this place is so hauntingly familiar. But each time Joanna goes under, her sense of dread begins to grow, because part of her already knows why the experience is so familiar, and why she has every reason to be afraid....And just when you think you know where she is going, Willis throws in the biggest surprise of all -- a shattering scenario that will keep you feverishly reading until the final climactic page is turned.From the Hardcover edition."
Q1170644,"It's the twenty-fifth century, and advances in technology have redefined life itself. A person's consciousness can now be stored in the brain and downloaded into a new body (or ""sleeve""), making death nothing more than a minor blip on a screen. Onetime U.N. Envoy Takeshi Kovacs has been killed before, but his last death was particularly painful. Resleeved into a body in Bay City (formerly San Francisco), Kovacs is thrown into the dark heart of a shady, far-reaching conspiracy that is vicious even by the standards of a society that treats existence as something that can be bought and sold.

Q963586,"With the incomparable vision and breathtaking detail that brought his now-classic Marstrilogy to vivid life, bestselling author KIM STANLEY ROBINSON boldly imagines an alternate history of the last seven hundred years. In his grandest work yet, the acclaimed storyteller constructs a world vastly different from the one we know....The Years of Rice and SaltIt is the fourteenth century and one of the most apocalyptic events in human history is set to occur--the coming of the Black Death. History teaches us that a third of Europe's population was destroyed. But what if? What if the plague killed 99 percent of the population instead? How would the world have changed? This is a look at the history that could have been--a history that stretches across centuries, a history that sees dynasties and nations rise and crumble, a history that spans horrible famine and magnificent innovation. These are the years of rice and salt. This is a universe where the first ship to reach the New World travels across the Pacific Ocean from China and colonization spreads from west to east. This is a universe where the Industrial Revolution is triggered by the world's greatest scientific minds--in India. This is a universe where Buddhism and Islam are the most influential and practiced religions and Christianity is merely a historical footnote. Through the eyes of soldiers and kings, explorers and philosophers, slaves and scholars, Robinson renders an immensely rich tapestry. Rewriting history and probing the most profound questions as only he can, Robinson shines his extraordinary light on the place of religion, culture, power, and even love on such an Earth. From the steppes of Asia to the shores of the Western Hemisphere, from the age of Akbar to the present and beyond, here is the stunning story of the creation of a new world.From the Hardcover edition."

The Light Brigade: it’s what soldiers fighting the war against Mars call the ones who come back…different.

Those who survive learn to stick to the mission brief—no matter what actually happens during combat.

Random Acts of Senseless Violence, Womack's fifth novel, is a thrilling, hysterical, and eerily disturbing piece ot work. 

Lola Hart is an ordinary twelve-year-old girl. She comes from a comfortable family, attends an exclusive private school, loves her friends Lori and Katherine, teases her sister Boob. But in the increasingly troubled city where she lives (a near-future Manhattan) she is a dying breed. Riots, fire, TB outbreaks, roaming gangs, increasing inflation, political and civil unrest all threaten her way of life, as well as the very fabric of New York City. 

In her diary, Lola chronicles the changes she and her family make as they attempt to adjust to a city, and a country, that is spinning out of control. Her mother is a teacher, but no one is hiring. Her father is a writer, but no one is buying his scripts. Hounded by creditors and forced to vacate their apartment and move to Harlem, her family, and her life, begins to dissolve. Increasingly estranged from her privileged school friends, Lola soon makes new ones: Iz, Jude, and Weezie - wise veterans of the street who know what must be done in order to survive and are more than willing to do it. And the metamorphosis of Lola Hart, who is surrounded by the new language and violence of the streets, begins.

Henry Dorsett Case was the sharpest data-thief in the business, until vengeful former employees crippled his nervous system. But now a new and very mysterious employer recruits him for a last-chance run.

With a dead man riding shotgun and Molly, mirror-eyed street-samurai, to watch his back, Case embarks on an adventure that ups the ante on an entire genre of fiction.

Q6980071,"Called ""fascinating"" by the New York Times upon its first publication in 1984, Native Tongue won wide critical praise and cult status, and has often been compared to the futurist fiction of Margaret Atwood. Set in the twenty-second century, the novel tells of a world where women are once again property, denied civil rights and banned from public life. Earth's wealth depends on interplanetary commerce with alien races, and linguists--a small, clannish group of families--have become the ruling elite by controlling all interplanetary communication. Their women are used to breed perfect translators for all the galaxies' languages.

Nazareth Chornyak, the most talented linguist of the family, is exhausted by her constant work translating for trade organizations, supervising the children's language education, running the compound, and caring for the elderly men. She longs to retire to the Barren House, where women past childbearing age knit, chat, and wait to die. What Nazareth comes to discover is that a slow revolution is going on in the Barren Houses: there, word by word, women are creating a language of their own to free them from men's control."

Q7798123,"When Murdoch was summoned to his grandfather's isolated Scottish castle, he had no idea of the old man's latest discovery -- nor where it would lead him.

Q3997517,"A world that hangs suspended between triumph and catastrophe, between the dismantling of the Wall and the fall of the Twin Towers, frozen in the shadow of suicide terrorism and global financial collapse, such a world requires a firm hand and a guiding light. But does it need the Concern: an all-powerful organisation with a malevolent presiding genius, pervasive influence and numberless invisible operatives in possession of extraordinary powers?

On the Concern's books are Temudjin Oh, an un-killable assassin who journeys between the peaks of Nepal, a version of Victorian London and the dark palaces of Venice; and a nameless, faceless torturer known only as the Philosopher. And then there's the renegade Mrs Mulverhill, who recruits rebels to her side; and Patient 8262, hiding out from a dirty past in a forgotten hospital ward. As these vivid, strange and sensuous worlds circle and collide, the implications of turning traitor to the Concern become horribly apparent, and an unstable universe is set on a dizzying course."

Q2511421,"*Two months since the stars fell...*

Two months since sixty-five thousand alien objects clenched around the Earth like a luminous fist, screaming to the heavens as the atmosphere burned them to ash. Two months since that moment of brief, bright surveillance by agents unknown. 

Two months of silence while a world holds its breath. 

Now some half-derelict space probe, sparking fitfully past Neptune's orbit, hears a whisper from the edge of the solar system: a faint signal sweeping the cosmos like a lighthouse beam. Whatever's out there isn't talking to us. It's talking to some distant star, perhaps. Or perhaps to something closer, something *en route.* 

So who do you send to force introductions on an intelligence with motives unknown, maybe unknowable? Who do you send to meet the alien when the alien doesn't want to meet? 

You send a linguist with multiple personalities, her brain surgically partitioned into separate, sentient processing cores. You send a biologist so radically interfaced with machinery that he sees X-rays and tastes ultrasound, so compromised by grafts and splices that he no longer feels his own flesh. You send a pacifist warrior in the faint hope she won't be needed, and a fainter hope that she'll do any good if she is needed. You send a monster to command them all, an extinct hominid predator once called ""vampire,"" recalled from the grave with the voodoo of recombinant genetics and the blood of sociopaths. And you send a synthesist—an informational topologist with half his mind gone—as an interface between *here* and *there,* a conduit through which the Dead Center might hope to understand the Bleeding Edge. 

You send them all to the edge of interstellar space, praying you can trust such freaks and retrofits with the fate of a world. You fear they may be more alien than the thing they've been sent to find. 

But you'd give anything for that to be true, if you only knew what was waiting for them...."
Q4398917,"Volume One of The Baroque Cycle 
(Not to be confused with [Quicksilver: The Baroque Cycle #1](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18199543W/Quicksilver))

Quicksilver is a massive, exuberant and wildly ambitious historical novel that's also Neal Stephenson's eagerly awaited prequel to Cryptonomicon--his pyrotechnic reworking of the 20th century, from World War II codebreaking and disinformation to the latest issues of Internet data privacy.

Quicksilver, ""Volume One of the Baroque Cycle"", backtracks to another time of high intellectual ferment: the late 17th century, with the natural philosophers of England's newly formed Royal Society questioning the universe and dissecting everything that moves. One founding member, the Rev John Wilkins, really did write science fiction and a book on cryptography--but this isn't history as we know it, for here his code book is called not Mercury but Cryptonomicon. And although the key political schemers of Charles II's government still have initials spelling the word CABAL, their names are all different...

While towering geniuses like Newton and Leibniz decode nature itself, bizarre adventures (merely beginning with the Great Plague and Great Fire) happen to the fictional Royal Society member Daniel Waterhouse, who knows everyone but isn't quite bright enough for cutting-edge science. Two generations of Daniel's family appear in Cryptonomicon, as does a descendant of the Shaftoes who here are soldiers and vagabonds. Other links include the island realm of Qwghlm with its impossible language and the mysterious, seemingly ageless alchemist Enoch Root.

As the reign of Charles II gives way to that of James II and then William of Orange, Stephenson traces the complex lines of finance and power that form the 17th-century Internet. Gold and silver, lead and (repeatedly) mercury or quicksilver flow in glittering patterns between centres of marketing and intrigue in England, Germany, France and Holland. Paper flows as well: stocks, shares, scams and letters holding layers of concealed code messages. Binary code? Yes, even that had already been invented and described by Francis Bacon.

Quicksilver is crammed with unexpected incidents, fascinating digressions and deep-laid plots. Who'd believe that Eliza, a Qwghlmian slave girl liberated from a Turkish harem by mad Jack Shaftoe (King of the Vagabonds) could become a major player in European finance and politics? Still less believable, but all too historically authentic, are the appalling medical procedures of the time--about which we learn a lot. There are frequent passages of high comedy, like the lengthy description of a foppish earl's costume which memorably explains that someone seemed to have been painted in glue before ""shaking and rolling him in a bin containing thousands of black silk doilies"".

This is a huge, exhausting read, full of rewards and quirky insights that no other author could have created. Fantastic or farcical episodes sometimes clash strangely with the deep cruelty and suffering of 17th-century realism. Recommended, though not to the faint-hearted.

Q3234544,"The planet called Harmony had been settled by humans nearly forty million years before. The colony had been placed under the care of an artificial intelligence, called the Oversoul, high in orbit. This master computer had one overriding command: Guard the people of Harmony against the dangers that destroyed humankind on Earth and other worlds. But now the Oversoul was itself in danger. Its systems were failing. Soon, within a thousand years, catastrophic war would break out on Harmony unless the Oversoul could be repaired.

The Oversoul determined that its core must be taken back to lost Earth, to interface with the Master Computer there, to be repaired and reprogrammed. But in order to do that, someone on Harmony must be given back the knowledge of space travel. And so the Oversoul must interfere directly with individuals on Harmony, in order to save the planet from disaster.

And so, on the planet, while on the road to the city called Basilica, a man named Wetchik had a vision of destruction, sent by the Oversoul. Soon his sons, Elemak, Issib, Mebbekew and Nafai were drawn into conflict-with the city and with each other-as the Oversoul began destabilizing forty million years of social engineering. But even a master computer worshipped as a god can't guarantee that knowledge will be used only as it is intended.

Q2377008,"From back cover Orb Trade paperback May 2011:

**Earth is in crisis.**  There simply isn't enough water and arable land to support the burgeoning population.  As the threat of nuclear war looms, the United States looks to Mars for the precious resources that could save humanity.  But somebody must actually journey to the Red Planet to effect a solution, and it would be far too difficult and costly to change Mars to suit man; therefore man must be changed to suit Mars.

Roger Torraway didn't plan to be Man Plus, the man who must undergo the surgeries and shaping necessary to enable someone to survive the hostile Martian environment.  When he volunteered to serve as an understudy to astronaut Willy Hartnett, Roger never thought he'd actually be called upon.  But when Willy dies in a freak accident, Roger becomes humanity's last hope.

With every new step toward becoming Man Plus, Roger becomes less and less the man he was to those around him, and more and more something new, something strange and alien.  Nothing about him is spared, not even his mind, which must adapt to being... different... if he is to survive.  All the while, he is constantly reminded that he must succeed in surviving on Mars -- there's no time to start over before war breaks out -- because the fate of humanity rests on his increasingly nonhuman shoulders.

Years after it won the Nebula Award, *Man Plus* is now, more than ever, a powerful, affecting novel about the worldwide environmental crisis that approaches, and the timeless questions of what makes us human."

If, against the odds, they survive two years of combat (or 10 years if things aren't going well, which they're not), they get another body and enjoy a fresh start on a colony.

John Perry did two things on his 75th birthday. First he visited his wife’s grave. Then he joined the army. The good news is that humanity finally made it into interstellar space. The bad news is that planets fit to live on are scarce—and alien races willing to fight us for them are common. So: we fight. To defend Earth, and to stake our own claim to planetary real estate. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding. Earth itself is a backwater. The bulk of humanity’s resources are in the hands of the Colonial Defense Force. Everybody knows that when you reach retirement age, you can join the CDF. They don’t want young people; they want people who carry the knowledge and skills of decades of living. You’ll be taken off Earth and never allowed to return. You’ll serve two years at the front. And if you survive, you’ll be given a generous homestead stake of your own, on one of our hard-won colony planets. John Perry is taking that deal. He has only the vaguest idea what to expect. Because the actual fight, light-years from home, is far, far harder than he can imagine—and what he will become is far stranger."

And Reid Malenfant is back in Texas, reliving the plane crash, looking up at the red moon, and knowing in his heart that Emma is there.Emma is there, beginning a journey of survival that is both horrific and fascinating, utterly familiar and totally beyond comprehension. Malenfant, teamed with a Japanese scientist named Nemoto, will get his chance to rescue his wife. But neither can foresee the extraordinary adventures that await them.

Q2363504,"David Brin: “Startide Rising” (1983)
 This is a sci fi story about a Terran (Earth) 
crew of neo-dolphins and humans on the starship “The Streaker”.  
Their mission is to find information about the first Galactic 
race, which existed billions of yeas ago. The neo-dolphins are 
dolphins which have gone through the ""Uplift"" process, which 
creates through genetic engineering  more intelligent sentient 
beings. For the neo-dolphins, this is also a test of their ability 
to apply their intelligence, knowledge and skills  to Galactic 
space travel and exploration. 
The Terrans find an ancient fleet of starships, and on a nearby 
planet, an ancient (human?) skeleton.  There are other Galactic 
races, who are also keen to find information about the first 
Galactic civilization.   Their  hot pursuit of the Terrans forces 
“The Streaker” to land on the planet Kithrup, whose watery 
environment and atmosphere are similar to Earth. Above the planet, 
the starships of the other Galactic races fight each other.  
On Kithrup, the dolphins and humans begin repairs to the Streaker, 
and to explore the ocean, and the inland area of their landing 
site.  They discover an aboriginal species living amongst the 
trees and lakes inland. There is evidence that there has 
been another Galactic race on the planet in the very distant past. 

Within the crew of the Streaker, tensions and conflicts develop on 
how to escape from Kithrup. The story centers on individual human 
and dolphin characters, and their struggle to survive and 
eventually to return to Earth with their very important findings. 
The story becomes one about courage, determination, friendship, 
love, and betrayal, both for the humans and the dolphins.
Main human characters:  Gillian Baskin, Tom Orley, Ignazio Metz.
Main neo-dolphins: Captain Creideiki; Hikahi; Keepiru; Makanee;

Q14548336,"A middle-aged man returns to his childhood home to attend a funeral. Although the house he lived in is long gone, he is drawn to the farm at the end of the road, where, when he was seven, he encountered a most remarkable girl, Lettie Hempstock, and her mother and grandmother. He hasn't thought of Lettie in decades, and yet as he sits by the pond (a pond that she'd claimed was an ocean) behind the ramshackle old farmhouse, the unremembered past comes flooding back. And it is a past too strange, too frightening, too dangerous to have happened to anyone, let alone a small boy.

Forty years earlier, a man committed suicide in a stolen car at this farm at the end of the road. Like a fuse on a firework, his death lit a touchpaper and resonated in unimaginable ways. The darkness was unleashed, something scary and thoroughly incomprehensible to a little boy. And Lettie—magical, comforting, wise beyond her years—promised to protect him, no matter what.

A groundbreaking work from a master, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is told with a rare understanding of all that makes us human, and shows the power of stories to reveal and shelter us from the darkness inside and out. It is a stirring, terrifying, and elegiac fable as delicate as a butterfly's wing and as menacing as a knife in the dark."
Q1758811,"The Plot Against America is a novel by Philip Roth published in 2004. It is an alternative history in which Franklin D. Roosevelt is defeated in the presidential election of 1940 by Charles Lindbergh. The novel follows the fortunes of the Roth family during the Lindbergh presidency, as antisemitism becomes more accepted in American life and Jewish-American families like the Roths are persecuted on various levels. The narrator and central character in the novel is the young Philip, and the care with which his confusion and terror are rendered makes the novel as much about the mysteries of growing up as about American politics. Roth based his novel on the isolationist ideas espoused by Lindbergh in real life as a spokesman for the America First Committee, and on his own experiences growing up in Newark, New Jersey. The novel received praise for the realism of its world and its treatment of topics such as antisemitism, trauma, and the perception of history. The novel depicts the Weequahic section of Newark which includes Weequahic High School from which Roth graduated.

In 2005, the novel won the James Fenimore Cooper Prize for Best Historical Fiction given by the Society of American Historians. It won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History, was a finalist for the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, and came in 11th for the 2005 Locus Awards."

Q492207,"Starship Troopers takes place in the midst of an interstellar war between the Terran Federation of Earth and the Arachnids (referred to as ""The Bugs"") of Klendathu. It is narrated as a series of flashbacks by Juan Rico, and is one of only a few Heinlein novels set out in this fashion.  The novel opens with Rico aboard the corvette  Rodger Young, about to embark on a raid against the planet of the ""Skinnies,"" who are allies of the Arachnids. We learn that he is a cap(sule) trooper in the Terran Federation's Mobile Infantry. The raid itself, one of the few instances of actual combat in the novel, is relatively brief: the Mobile Infantry land on the planet, destroy their targets, and retreat, suffering a single casualty in the process.

The story then flashes back to Rico's graduation from high school, and his decision to sign up for Federal Service over the objections of his father. This is the only chapter that describes Rico's civilian life, and most of it is spent on the monologues of two people: retired Lt. Col. Jean V. Dubois, Rico's school instructor in ""History and Moral Philosophy,"" and Fleet Sergeant Ho, a recruiter for the armed forces of the Terran Federation.

Dubois serves as a stand-in for Heinlein throughout the novel, and delivers what is probably the book's most famous soliloquy on violence, and how it ""has settled more issues in history than has any other factor."" Fleet Sergeant Ho's monologues examine the nature of military service, and his anti-military tirades appear in the book primarily as a contrast with Dubois. (It is later revealed that his rants are calculated to scare off the weaker applicants).

Interspersed throughout the book are other flashbacks to Rico's high school History and Moral Philosophy course, which describe how in the Terran Federation of Rico's day, the rights of a full Citizen (to vote, and hold public office) must be earned through some form of volunteer Federal service. Those residents who have not exercised their right to perform this Federal Service retain the other rights generally associated with a modern democracy (free speech, assembly, etc.), but they cannot vote or hold public office. This structure arose ad hoc after the collapse of the 20th century Western democracies, brought on by both social failures at home and military defeat by the Chinese Hegemony overseas (assumed looking forward into the late 20th century from the time the novel was written in the late 1950s).

In the next section of the novel Rico goes to boot camp at Camp Arthur Currie, on the northern prairies. Five chapters are spent exploring Rico's experience entering the service under the training of his instructor, Career Ship's Sergeant Charles Zim. Camp Currie is so rigorous that less than ten percent of the recruits finish basic training; the rest either resign, are expelled, or die in training. One of the chapters deals with Ted Hendrick, a fellow recruit and constant complainer who is flogged and expelled for striking a superior officer. Another recruit, a deserter who committed a heinous crime while AWOL, is hanged by his battalion. Rico himself is flogged for poor handling of (simulated) nuclear weapons during a drill; despite these experiences he eventually graduates and is assigned to a unit.

At some point during Rico's training, the 'Bug War' has begun to brew, and Rico finds himself taking part in combat operations. The war ""officially"" starts with an Arachnid attack that annihilates the city of Buenos Aires, although Rico makes it clear that prior to the attack there were plenty of ""'incidents,' 'patrols,' or 'police actions.'"" Rico briefly describes the Terran Federation's loss at the Battle of Klendathu where his unit is decimated and his ship destroyed. Following Klendathu, the Terran Federation is reduced to making hit-and-run raids similar to the one described at the beginning of the novel (which, chronologically would be placed between Chapters 10 and 11). Rico meanwhile finds himself posted to Rasczak's Roughnecks, named after Lieutenant Rasczak (his first name is never given). This part of the book focuses on the daily routine of military life, as well as the relationship between officers and non-commissioned officers, personified in this case by Rasczak and Sergeant Jelal.

Eventually, Rico decides to become a career soldier and attends Officer Candidate School, which turns out to be just like boot camp, only ""squared and cubed with books added.""[15] Rico is commissioned a temporary Third Lieutenant as a field-test final exam and commands his own unit during Operation Royalty; eventually he graduates as a Second Lieutenant and full-fledged officer.

The final chapter serves as more of a coda, depicting Rico aboard the Rodger Young as the lieutenant in command of Rico's Roughnecks, preparing to drop to Klendathu as part of a major strike, with his father (having joined the Service earlier in the novel) as his senior sergeant and a Third Lieutenant-in-training of his own under his wing."

Q2915854,"When struggling riverboat captain Abner Marsh receives an offer of partnership from a wealthy aristocrat, he suspects something's amiss. But when he meets the hauntingly pale, steely-eyed Joshua York, he is certain. For York doesn't care that the icy winter of 1857 has wiped out all but one of Marsh's dilapidated fleet. Nor does he care that he won't earn back his investment in a decade. York has his own reasons for wanting to traverse the powerful Mississippi. And they are to be none of Marsh's concern--no matter how bizarre, arbitrary, or capricious his actions may prove. Marsh meant to turn down York's offer. It was too full of secrets that spelled danger. But the promise of both gold and a grand new boat that could make history crushed his resolve--coupled with the terrible force of York's mesmerizing gaze. Not until the maiden voyage of his new sidewheeler Fevre Dream would Marsh realize he had joined a mission both more sinister, and perhaps more noble, than his most fantastic nightmare...and mankind's most impossible dream.

Q1968531,"Poul Anderson's Tau Zero is an outstanding work of science fiction, in part because it combines two qualities that are often at odds in this genre: an interest in the emotional lives of its characters and a fascination with all things technological and scientific.  In Tau Zero these components are not merely fused; they work together with a remarkable synergy that makes the novel much more than just a deep space adventure story.The novel centers on a ten-year interstellar voyage aboard the spaceship Leonora Christine, and it opens with members of the crew preparing for their departure from earth.  It is an especially moving departure because they know that while they are aboard the ship and traveling close to the speed of light, time will be passing much more quickly back home.  As a result, by the time they return everyone they know will have long since died.  From practically the very first page, therefore, Tau Zero sets the scientific realities of space travel in dramatic tension with the no-less-real emotional and psychological states of the travelers.  This is a dynamic Anderson explores with great success over the course of the novel as fifty crewmembers settle in for the long journey together.  They are a highly-trained team of  scientists and researchers, but they are also a community of individuals, each trying to make a life for him or herself in space.This is the background within which the action of the novel takes place.  Anderson carefully depicts the network of relationships linking these people before the real plot begins to unfold.   The voyage soon takes a unexpected and disastrous turn for the worse.  The ship passes through a small, uncharted, cloudlike nebula that makes it impossible for the crew to decelerate the ship.  The only hope, in fact, is for the ship to speed up.  But acceleration towards the speed of light means that time outside the spaceship passes even more quickly, and the crew finds itself hurtling deeper into space and further into the future.  Anderson's experience as a physicist is evidenced in the knowledgeable way he discusses the technical details of space and time travel, although his explanations never become burdensome or tedious.  More to the point,  the painstaking care with which he has drawn the characters ensures that the action is both imaginatively compelling and emotionally meaningful.  It is a combination that is unfortunately all too rare in science fiction."

Q2008211,"[Comment by Kim Stanley Robinson, on The Guardian's website][1]:
The Left Hand of Darkness by Ursula K Le Guin (1969)

> One of my favorite novels is The Left Hand of Darkness, by Ursula K Le Guin. For more than 40 years I've been recommending this book to people who want to try science fiction for the first time, and it still serves very well for that. One of the things I like about it is how clearly it demonstrates that science fiction can have not only the usual virtues and pleasures of the novel, but also the startling and transformative power of the thought experiment.

> In this case, the thought experiment is quickly revealed: ""The king was pregnant,"" the book tells us early on, and after that we learn more and more about this planet named Winter, stuck in an ice age, where the humans are most of the time neither male nor female, but with the potential to become either. The man from Earth investigating this situation has a lot to learn, and so do we; and we learn it in the course of a thrilling adventure story, including a great ""crossing of the ice"". Le Guin's language is clear and clean, and has within it both the anthropological mindset of her father Alfred Kroeber, and the poetry of stories as magical things that her mother Theodora Kroeber found in native American tales. This worldly wisdom applied to the romance of other planets, and to human nature at its deepest, is Le Guin's particular gift to us, and something science fiction will always be proud of. Try it and see – you will never think about people in quite the same way again.

Q132062,"“The Lathe of Heaven” ; 1971 ( Ursula Le Guin received the 1973 Locus Award for this story)
George Orr has a gift – he is an effective dreamer:  his dreams become reality when he wakes up. He is aware of his past and present, two or more sets of memories, although the people around him are only aware of the current reality. 
This science fiction story is set in Portland, Oregon, in/around the late 1990s - early 2000s.  Orr begins to take drugs to suppress dreams but eventually he is sent to a psychotherapist, Dr. William Haber, who has developed an electronic  machine, the Augmentor, which records the brain patterns of a person as they dream.  When Haber realizes that he can use Orr's unique ability to change their world, the consequences  are both beneficial and frightening,  both locally and globally.  Orr seeks out the help of a civil rights lawyer, Heather Lelache, who attends a treatment session, and sees Portland change before her very eyes as Orr awakens.  In a strange turn of events, Heather helps Orr by putting him in a dream state where Orr can undo some of Haber's actions. The result – Aliens on the Moon land on Earth !  A special affinity exists between George Orr and the Aliens, who seem to understand  his unique gift.   Ultimately Haber decides to impose Orr's brain patterns on his own, so that he can bring about world-wide changes. Orr and Heather feel the chaos and a sense of a void as Haber dreams.  Orr rushes back to Haber's office and turns off the Augmentor.  The world  returns to April 1998."

> Light is the kind of novel other writers read and think: ""Why don't I just give up and go home?"" That was certainly my first reaction on reading its mix of coldly perfect prose and attractively twisted insanity. It's also the only book to bring me unpleasantly close to sympathising with a serial killer. But this is M John Harrison: so antihero Michael Kearney is a mathematically brilliant, dice-throwing, reality-changing hyper-intelligent serial killer haunted by a horse-skulled personal demon.

> Harrison's genius is to tie Kearney's narrative thread to those of Seria Mau – a far-future girl existing in harmony with White Cat, her spaceship, surfing a part of the galaxy known as the Kefahuchi Tract – and Chinese Ed, a sleazy if likeable cyberpunky chancer with a passion for virtual sex.

> This is not a kind book, or even a particularly likeable book. But then I suspected it was never intended to be, and the author wouldn't want the kind of people who want to like characters as his readers anyway. What it is is stunningly written, meticulously plotted, hallucinogenically realised and brutally honest. No one who reads it could doubt that Harrison might win the Booker if he could be bothered.

> Light is also the book that novelist and critic Adam Roberts was so sure would win the Arthur C Clarke award, he offered to change his name to Adam Van Hoogenroberts if it didn't. We're still waiting . . .

Lisa Tuttle has won acclaim from fans of science fiction, horror, and fantasy alike -- most recently for her haunting novel  The Pillow Friend. Now together they gift readers with this classic tale of a brilliantly rendered world of ironbound tradition, where a rebellious soul seeks to prove the power of a dream.The planet of Windhaven was not originally a home to humans, but it became one following the crash of a colony starship. It is a world of small islands, harsh weather, and monster-infested seas. Communication among the scattered settlements was virtually impossible until the discovery that, thanks to light gravity and a dense atmosphere, humans were able to fly with the aid of metal wings made of bits of the cannibalized spaceship.Many generations later, among the scattered islands that make up the water world of Windhaven, no one holds more prestige than the silver-winged flyers, who bring news, gossip, songs, and stories. They are romantic figures crossing treacherous oceans, braving shifting winds and sudden storms that could easily dash them from the sky to instant death. They are also members of an increasingly elite caste, for the wings -- always in limited quantity -- are growing gradually rarer as their bearers perish.With such elitism comes arrogance and a rigid adherence to hidebound tradition. And for the flyers, allowing just anyone to join their cadre is an idea that borders on heresy. Wings are meant only for the offspring of flyers -- now the new nobility of Windhaven. Except that sometimes life is not quite so neat.Maris of Amberly, a fisherman's daughter, was raised by a flyer and wants nothing more than to soar on the currents high above Windhaven. By tradition, however, the wings must go to her stepbrother, Coll, the flyer's legitimate son. But Coll wants only to be a singer, traveling the world by sea. So Maris challenges tradition, demanding that flyers be chosen on the basis of merit rather than inheritance. And when she wins that bitter battle, she discovers that her troubles are only beginning.For not all flyers are willing to accept the world's new structure, and as Maris battles to teach those who yearn to fly, she finds herself likewise fighting to preserve the integrity of a society she so longed to join -- not to mention the very fabric that holds her culture together.From the Hardcover edition."

Q2027568,"When Robin wakes up in a clinic with most of his memories missing, it doesn't take him long to discover that someone is trying to kill him. It's the 27th century, when interstellar travel is by teleport gate and conflicts are fought by network worms that censor refugees' personalities and target historians.

Q586831,"The citizens of the planet Lithia are some of the most ethical sentient beings Father Ramon Ruiz-Sanchez has ever encountered. True, they have no literature, no fine arts, and don't understand the concept of recreation, but neither do they understand the concepts of greed, envy, lust, or any of the sins and vices that plague humankind. Their world seems darned near perfect. And that is just what disturbs the good Father.

First published in 1959, James Blish's Hugo Award-winning A Case of Conscience is science fiction at its very best: a fast-paced, intelligent story that offers plenty of action while at the same time explores complex questions of values and ethics. In this case, Blish has taken on the age-old battle of good vs. evil. Lithia poses a theological question that lies at the heart of this book: is God necessary for a moral society? The Lithians are nothing if not moral. Not only do they lack the seven deadly sins, they also lack original sin. And without any sort of religious framework, they have created the Christian ideal world, one that humans would be eager to study and emulate. But is it too perfect? Is it in fact, as Father Ruiz-Sanchez suspects, the work of The Adversary? And what role does Egtverchi, the young Lithian raised on Earth, play? Is he an innocent victim of circumstance, or will he bring about the Dies Irae, the day of the wrath of God, upon the earth? The fate of two worlds hinges on the answers to these questions, and will lead to an ancient earth heresy that shakes the Jesuit priest's beliefs to their very core.

A Case of Conscience is a brilliant piece of storytelling, and it packs a lot into a scant 242 pages. Most readers will probably finish the book in one sitting, unable to stop until the spectacular denouement. But the questions posed by this little-known gem will stay with you for days afterward. --P.M. Atterberry"

Q602216,"A mythmaker of the highest order, China Mieville has emblazoned the fantasy novel with fresh language, startling images, and stunning originality. Set in the same sprawling world of Mieville's Arthur C. Clarke Award-winning novel, Perdido Street Station, this latest epic introduces a whole new cast of intriguing characters and dazzling creations.

But the journey is not theirs alone. They are joined by a handful of travelers, each with a reason for fleeing the city. Among them is Bellis Coldwine, a renowned linguist whose services as an interpreter grant her passage--and escape from horrific punishment.

Q20058615,"Humans expanded into space... only to find a universe populated with multiple alien species bent on their destruction. Thus was the Colonial Union formed, to help protect us from a hostile universe. The Colonial Union used the Earth and its excess population for colonists and soldiers. It was a good arrangement... for the Colonial Union. Then the Earth said: no more.

Q3120527,"In the near future, disease will be a condition of the past. Most genetic defects will be removed at birth; the remaining during infancy. Unfortunately, there will be a generation left behind. For members of that missed generation, small advances will be made. Through various programs, they will be taught to get along in the world despite their differences. They will be made active and contributing members of society. But they will never be normal.Lou Arrendale is a member of that lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap the awards of medical science. Part of a small group of high-functioning autistic adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact. He has taught himself to use ""please"" and ""thank you"" and other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable. He does his best to be as normal as possible and not to draw attention to himself. But then his quiet life comes under attack. It starts with an experimental treatment that will reverse the effects of autism in adults. With this treatment Lou would think and act and be just like everyone else. But if he was suddenly free of autism, would he still be himself? Would he still love the same classical music--with its complications and resolutions? Would he still see the same colors and patterns in the world--shades and hues that others cannot see? Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to reciprocate his feelings? Would it be easier for her to return the love of a ""normal""?There are intense pressures coming from the world around him--including an angry supervisor who wants to cut costs by sacrificing the supports necessary to employ autistic workers. Perhaps even more disturbing are the barrage of questions within himself. For Lou must decide if he should submit to a surgery that might completely change the way he views the world . . . and the very essence of who he is.Thoughtful, provocative, poignant, unforgettable, The Speed of Dark is a gripping exploration into the mind of an autistic person as he struggles with profound questions of humanity and matters of the heart.From the Hardcover edition."

Q684818,"In a world renowned even within a galaxy full of wonders, a crime within a war. For one brother it means a desperate flight, and a search for the one - maybe two - people who could clear his name. For his brother it means a life lived under constant threat of treachery and murder. And for their sister, even without knowing the full truth, it means returning to a place she'd thought abandoned forever.

Q1140295,"Cormac McCarthy's tenth novel, The Road, is his most harrowing yet deeply personal work. Some unnamed catastrophe has scourged the world to a burnt-out cinder, inhabited by the last remnants of mankind and a very few surviving dogs and fungi. The sky is perpetually shrouded by dust and toxic particulates; the seasons are merely varied intensities of cold and dampness. Bands of cannibals roam the roads and inhabit what few dwellings remain intact in the woods.

Through this nightmarish residue of America a haggard father and his young son attempt to flee the oncoming Appalachian winter and head towards the southern coast along carefully chosen back roads. Mummified corpses are their only benign companions, sitting in doorways and automobiles, variously impaled or displayed on pikes and tables and in cake bells, or they rise in frozen poses of horror and agony out of congealed asphalt. The boy and his father hope to avoid the marauders, reach a milder climate, and perhaps locate some remnants of civilization still worthy of that name. They possess only what they can scavenge to eat, and the rags they wear and the heat of their own bodies are all the shelter they have. A pistol with only a few bullets is their only defense besides flight. Before them the father pushes a shopping cart filled with blankets, cans of food and a few other assets, like jars of lamp oil or gasoline siphoned from the tanks of abandoned vehicles—the cart is equipped with a bicycle mirror so that they will not be surprised from behind.

Through encounters with other survivors brutal, desperate or pathetic, the father and son are both hardened and sustained by their will, their hard-won survivalist savvy, and most of all by their love for each other. They struggle over mountains, navigate perilous roads and forests reduced to ash and cinders, endure killing cold and freezing rainfall. Passing through charred ghost towns and ransacking abandoned markets for meager provisions, the pair battle to remain hopeful. They seek the most rudimentary sort of salvation. However, in The Road, such redemption as might be permitted by their circumstances depends on the boy’s ability to sustain his own instincts for compassion and empathy in opposition to his father’s insistence upon their mutual self-interest and survival at all physical and moral costs.

The Road was the winner of the 2006 Pulitzer Prize for Literature.

Q2268557,"Nicola Griffith, winner of the Tiptree Award and the Lambda Award for her widely acclaimed first novel Ammonite, now turns her attention closer to the present in Slow River, the dark and intensely involving story of a young woman's struggle for survival and independence on the gritty underside of a near-future Europe.She awoke in an alley to the splash of rain. She was naked, a foot-long gash in her back was still bleeding, and her identity implant was gone. Lore Van de Oest was the daughter of one of the world's most powerful families...and now she was nobody. Then out of the rain walked Spanner, an expert data pirate who took her in, cared for her wounds, and gave her the freedom to reinvent herself again and again. No one could find Lore if she didn't want to be found: not the police, not her family, and not the kidnappers who had left her in that alley to die. She had escaped...but she paid for her newfound freedom in crime, deception, and degradation--over and over again. Lore had a choice: She could stay in the shadows, stay with Spanner...and risk losing herself forever. Or she could leave Spanner and find herself again by becoming someone else: stealing the identity implant of a dead woman, taking over her life, and inventing her future.But to start again, Lore required Spanner's talents--Spanner, who needed her and hated her, and who always had a price. And even as Lore agreed to play Spanner's games one final time, she found that there was still the price of being a Van de Oest to be paid. Only by confronting her past, her family, and her own demons could Lore meld together who she had once been, who she had become, and the person she intended to be....In Slow River, Nicola Griffith skillfully takes us deep into the mind and heart of her complex protagonist, where the past must be reconciled with the present if the future is ever to offer solid ground. Slow River poses a question we all hope never to need to answer: Who are you when you have nothing left? From the Hardcover edition."

Under Heaven is a novel of heroes, assassins, concubines and emperors set against a majestic and unforgiving landscape. For two years Shen Tai has mourned his father, living like a hermit beyond the borders of the Kitan Empire, by a mountain lake where terrible battles have long been fought between the Kitai and the neighbouring Tagurans, including one for which his father - a great general - was honoured. But Tai's father never forgot the brutal slaughter involved.

His supplies are replenished by his own people from the nearest fort, and also - since peace has been bought with the bartering of an imperial princess - by the Tagurans, for his solitary honouring of their dead. The Tagurans soldiers one day bring an unexpected letter. It is from the bartered Kitan Princess Cheng-wan, and it contains a poisoned chalice: she has gifted Tai with two hundred and fifty Sardian horses, to reward him for his courage.

Q1764445,"Few books have captivated the imagination and won the devotion and praise of readers and critics everywhere as has George R. R. Martin’s monumental epic cycle of high fantasy. Now, in A Feast for Crows, Martin delivers the long-awaited fourth book of his landmark series, as a kingdom torn asunder finds itself at last on the brink of peace . . . only to be launched on an even more terrifying course of destruction.


It seems too good to be true. After centuries of bitter strife and fatal treachery, the seven powers dividing the land have decimated one another into an uneasy truce. Or so it appears. . . . With the death of the monstrous King Joffrey, Cersei is ruling as regent in King’s Landing. Robb Stark’s demise has broken the back of the Northern rebels, and his siblings are scattered throughout the kingdom like seeds on barren soil. Few legitimate claims to the once desperately sought Iron Throne still exist—or they are held in hands too weak or too distant to wield them effectively. The war, which raged out of control for so long, has burned itself out. 

But as in the aftermath of any climactic struggle, it is not long before the survivors, outlaws, renegades, and carrion eaters start to gather, picking over the bones of the dead and fighting for the spoils of the soon-to-be dead. Now in the Seven Kingdoms, as the human crows assemble over a banquet of ashes, daring new plots and dangerous new alliances are formed, while surprising faces—some familiar, others only just appearing—are seen emerging from an ominous twilight of past struggles and chaos to take up the challenges ahead. 

It is a time when the wise and the ambitious, the deceitful and the strong will acquire the skills, the power, and the magic to survive the stark and terrible times that lie before them. It is a time for nobles and commoners, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and sages to come together and stake their fortunes . . . and their lives. For at a feast for crows, many are the guests—but only a few are the survivors."

Ponter Boddit, a Neanderthal physicist, accidentally pierces the barrier between worlds and is transferred to our universe.  Almost immediately recognized as a Neanderthal, but only much later as a scientist, he is quarantined and studied, alone and bewildered, a stranger in a strange land.

Q466790,"The Dead Zone is a science fiction thriller novel by Stephen King published in 1979. The story follows Johnny Smith, who awakens from a coma of nearly five years and, apparently as a result of brain damage, now experiences clairvoyant and precognitive visions triggered by touch. When some information is blocked from his perception, Johnny refers to that information as being trapped in the part of his brain that is permanently damaged, ""the dead zone."" The novel also follows a serial killer in Castle Rock, and the life of rising politician Greg Stillson, both of whom are evils Johnny must eventually face.

Though earlier King books were successful, The Dead Zone was the first of his novels to rank among the ten best-selling novels of the year in the United States. The book was nominated for the Locus Award in 1980 and was dedicated to King's son Owen. The Dead Zone is the first story by King to feature the fictional town of Castle Rock, which serves as the setting for several later stories and is referenced in others. The TV series Castle Rock takes place in this fictional town and makes references to the Strangler whom Johnny helped track down in The Dead Zone.

Q2468406,"From the master of alternate history comes an epic of the Second Civil War. It was an epoch of glory and success, of disaster and despair. Twenty years after the South won the Civil War, America writhed once more in the bloody throes of battle. Furious over the annexation of key Mexican territory, the United States declared total war against the Confederate States of America. And so, in 1883, the fragile peace was shattered.But this was a new kind of war, fought on a lawless frontier where the blue and gray battled not only each other, but the Apache, the outlaw, and even the redcoat. Along with France, England entered the fray on the side of the South, with blockades and invasions from Canada. Out of this tragic struggle emerged figures great and small. The disgraced Abraham Lincoln crisscrossed the nation championing socialist ideals. Confederate cavalry leader Jeb Stuart sought to prevent wholesale slaughter in the desert Southwest, while cocky young Theodore Roosevelt and stodgy George Custer bickered over modern weapons--even as they drove the British back into western Canada.Thanks to the efforts of journalists like Samuel Clemens, the nation witnessed the clash of human dreams and passions. Confederate genius Stonewall Jackson again soared to the heights of military expertise, while the North's McClellan proved sadly undeserving of his once shining reputation as the ""young Napoleon.""  For in the Second War Between the States, the times, the stakes, and the battle lines had changed . . . and so would history.Once again, Harry Turtledove has created a thoroughly engrossing alternate history novel, a profoundly original epic of blood and honor, courage and sacrifice, set amidst the raw beauty of young America's frontier wilderness.From the Hardcover edition."

Q18366291,"In her first novel since 2002, Nebula and Hugo award-winning author Connie Willis returns with a stunning, enormously entertaining novel of time travel, war, and the deeds--great and small--of ordinary people who shape history. In the hands of this acclaimed storyteller, the past and future collide--and the result is at once intriguing, elusive, and frightening.Oxford in 2060 is a chaotic place. Scores of time-traveling historians are being sent into the past, to destinations including the American Civil War and the attack on the World Trade Center. Michael Davies is prepping to go to Pearl Harbor. Merope Ward is coping with a bunch of bratty 1940 evacuees and trying to talk her thesis adviser, Mr. Dunworthy, into letting her go to VE Day.

For there they face air raids, blackouts, unexploded bombs, dive-bombing Stukas, rationing, shrapnel, V-1s, and two of the most incorrigible children in all of history--to say nothing of a growing feeling that not only their assignments but the war and history itself are spiraling out of control. Because suddenly the once-reliable mechanisms of time travel are showing significant glitches, and our heroes are beginning to question their most firmly held belief: that no historian can possibly change the past.From the people sheltering in the tube stations of London to the retired sailors who set off across the Channel to rescue the stranded British Army from Dunkirk, from shopgirls to ambulance drivers, from spies to hospital nurses to Shakespearean actors, Blackout reveals a side of World War II seldom seen before: a dangerous, desperate world in which there are no civilians and in which everybody--from the Queen down to the lowliest barmaid--is determined to do their bit to help a beleaguered nation survive.From the Hardcover edition."
Q944991,"Two 19th century stage illusionists, the aristocratic Rupert Angier and the working-class Alfred Borden, engage in a bitter and deadly feud; the effects are still being felt by their respective families a hundred years later. Working in the gaslight-and-velvet world of Victorian music halls, they prowl edgily in the background of each other's shadowy life, driven to the extremes by a deadly combination of obsessive secrecy and insatiable curiosity. At the heart of the row is an amazing illusion they both perform during their stage acts. The secret of the magic is simple, and the reader is in on it almost from the start, but to the antagonists the real mystery lies deeper. Both have something more to hide than the mere workings of a trick."

SECOND CONTACT

Nearly two centuries after the starship *Phoenix* disappeared into the heavens, leaving an isolated colony of humans on the world of the *atevi*, it unexpectedly returns to orbit overhead, threatening the stability of both *atevi* and human governments.

With the situation fast becoming critical, Bren Cameron, the brilliant, young *paidhi* to the court of the *atevi* is recalled from Mospheira where he has just undergone surgery.  But his sudden and premature return to the mainland is cause for more then mere physical discomfort.

And though she should despair when Bren is once again able to fill his post, no recall order comes.

Cut off from his government and haunted by the continuing threat of assassination, Bren realizes his only hope may be to communicate directly with the *Phoenix* as the spokesman of the *atevi* -- an action which may cut him off for good from his own species.

Q6690221,"Pierce Moffett stands at a turning point, when the world is changing from what it has been into what it will be. Is it only a moment in the history of his own soul? Or the course of his generation's progress toward maturity?

As a child Pierce was no stranger to magic. Transplanted from his native Brooklyn to the Cumberland Mountains of Kentucky, he and his cousins formed a secret club called the Invisible College. Fueled by books, adventures, and the imagination of youth, they scratched the surface of ordinary life and found the hints of something glittering and strange underneath.

For most children these revelations fade with the coming of adulthood, but for Pierce the search for the hidden history of the world is just beginning.

It is a search that begins with the unfinished manuscript of a writer named Fellowes Kraft and leads to the real-life history of the doomed heretic Giordano Bruno and the Elizabethan metaphysician John Dee. These mysteries reach from past to present, to intertwine themselves with the life of Rosie Rasmussen, who brought Pierce that unfinished manuscript and will be given charge of Pierce's destiny.

And as he delves deeper, Pierce begins to apprehend a power beyond reckoning, a knowledge beyond imagining, and a love that can waken sleeping souls. Only rarely does an author emerge with the vision, the voice, and the courage to speculate on the alchemy that transforms the everyday into something transcendent.

Now, in an extraordinary flight of the imagination a half-century in the making, he takes us to a most wondrous destination: into the heart of an Eternal Family.

They have lived for centuries in a house of legend and mystery in upper Illinois -- and they are not like other midwesterners. Rarely encountered in daylight hours, their children are curious and wild; their old ones have survived since before the Sphinx first sank its paws deep in Egyptian sands. And some sleep in beds with lids.

Now the house is being readied in anticipation of the gala homecoming that will gather together the farflung branches of this odd and remarkable family. In the past-midnight stillness can be detected the soft fluttering of Uncle Einars wings. From her realm of sleep, Cecy, the fairest and most special daughter, can feel the approach of many a welcome being -- shapeshifter, telepath, somnambulist, vampire -- as she flies high in the consciousness of bird and bat.

But in the midst of eager anticipation, a sense of doom pervades. For the world is changing. And death, no stranger, will always shadow this most singular family: Father, arisen from the Earth; Mother, who never sleeps but dreams; A Thousand Times Great Grandmére; Grandfather, who keeps the wildness of youth between his ears.

As governments and multinationals attack the endeavor, Randy joins forces with Shaftoe's tough-as-nails granddaughter, Amy, to secretly salvage a sunken Nazi submarine that holds the key to keeping the dream of a data haven afloat.

But soon their scheme brings to light a massive conspiracy, with its roots in Detachment 2702, linked to an unbreakable Nazi code called Arethusa. And it will represent the path to unimaginable riches and a future of personal and digital liberty...or to universal totalitarianism reborn. 

A breathtaking tour de force, and Neal Stephenson's most accomplished and affecting work to date, Cryptonomicon is profound and prophetic, hypnotic and hyper-driven, as it leaps forward and back between World War II and the World Wide Web, hinting all the while at a dark day-after-tomorrow.

Jules is a young man barely a century old. He's lived long enough to see the cure for death and the end of scarcity, to learn ten languages and compose three symphonies ... and to realize his boyhood dream of taking up residence in Disney World.

Disney World! The greatest artistic achievement of the long-ago twentieth century. Now in the keeping of a network of ""ad-hocs"" who keep the classic attractions running as they always have, enhanced with only the smallest high-tech touches.

Now, though, the ""ad hocs"" are under attack. A new group has taken over the Hall of the Presidents, and is replacing its venerable audioanimatronics with new, immersive direct-to-brain interfaces that give guests the illusion of being Washington, Lincoln, and all the others. For Jules, this is an attack on the artistic purity of Disney World itself. 

Worse: it appears this new group has had Jules killed. This upsets him. (It's only his fourth death and revival, after all.) Now it's war ....

In her day job as a counterterrorism wizard for an transnational cybersecurity firm, she made the hacks that allowed repressive regimes to spy on dissidents, and manipulate their every move. The perks were fantastic, and the pay was obscene.

Just for fun, and to piss off her masters, Masha sometimes used her mad skills to help those same troublemakers evade detection, if their cause was just. It was a dangerous game and a hell of a rush. But seriously self-destructive. And unsustainable.

When her targets were strangers in faraway police states, it was easy to compartmentalize, to ignore the collateral damage of murder, rape, and torture. But when it hits close to home, and the hacks and exploits she’s devised are directed at her friends and family--including boy wonder Marcus Yallow, her old crush and archrival, and his entourage of naïve idealists--Masha realizes she has to choose.

Q2469019,"The Ankh-Morpork Post Office is running like . . . well, not at all like a government office. The mail is delivered promptly; meetings start and end on time; five out of six letters relegated to the Blind Letter Office ultimately wend their way to the correct addresses. Postmaster General Moist von Lipwig, former arch-swindler and confidence man, has exceeded all expectations—including his own. So it's somewhat disconcerting when Lord Vetinari summons Moist to the palace and asks, ""Tell me, Mr. Lipwig, would you like to make some real money?""Vetinari isn't talking about wages, of course. He's referring, rather, to the Royal Mint of Ankh-Morpork, a venerable institution that haas run for centuries on the hereditary employment of the Men of the Sheds and their loyal outworkers, who do make money in their spare time. Unfortunately, it costs more than a penny to make a penny, so the whole process seems somewhat counterintuitive.Next door, at the Royal Bank, the Glooper, an ""analogy machine,"" has scientifically established that one never has quite as much money at the end of the week as one thinks one should, and the bank's chairman, one elderly Topsy (nee Turvy) Lavish, keeps two loaded crossbows at her desk. Oh, and the chief clerk is probably a vampire.But before Moist has time to fully consider Vetinari's question, fate answers it for him. Now he's not only making money, but enemies too; he's got to spring a prisoner from jail, break into his own bank vault, stop the new manager from licking his face, and, above all, find out where all the gold has gone—otherwise, his life in banking, while very exciting, is going to be really, really short. . . ."

On the grossly-overpopulated planet, remnants of ""nature"" exist only in the isolated areas not covered by housing, industry and industrial farming. Creativity and individuality are suppressed and channeled into rigid social formats. A powerful 
bureaucracy
/
police state
 oversees the acts of all citizens. Its purpose is to maintain control for the planetary elite, and to that end it is prepared to resort to any method, however ruthless.

In contrast to all this, the author introduces another planet on which human development has followed a diametrically opposite path: the natural world is respected; population is limited; and each individual is encouraged to develop uniquely. On this other world, human beings are known to be basically ""spiritual"", and immortal in nature. 
Telepathy
 and 
telekinesis
 are developed as much and as rapidly as possible.

As the narrative progresses, a confrontation develops between these different systems."

A 
generation ship
 is launched from 
Earth
 in 2545 at 0.1 
c
 (i.e. traveling at 30,000 km/s or 10% the speed of light). It includes twenty-four self-contained 
biomes
 and an average population of two thousand people. One hundred sixty years and approximately seven generations later, it is beginning its deceleration into the 
Tau Ceti
 system to begin colonization of a planet's moon, an 
Earth analog
, which has been named Aurora.

Devi, the ship's 
de facto
 chief engineer and leader, is concerned about the decaying infrastructure and biology of the ship: systems are breaking down, each generation has lower intelligence test scores than the last, and bacteria are mutating and evolving at a faster rate than humans. She tells the ship's AI, referred to simply as Ship, to keep a 
narrative
 of the voyage. After having some trouble with understanding the human concept of narrative, Ship eventually elects to follow the life of Devi's daughter Freya as a 
protagonist
.

As a teenager, Freya travels around the ship on her 
wanderjahr
 and learns that many of the ship's inhabitants are dissatisfied with their enclosed existence and what they perceive as a 
dictatorship
. Movement is strictly limited for most people, reproduction is tightly controlled, and education in science and mathematics is mandatory. Freya's 
wanderjahr
 comes to an end when she is called home as Devi grows sick from cancer and dies.

The ship arrives in the Tau Ceti system and begins to settle Aurora, a moon of 
Tau Ceti e
. It soon becomes apparent that 
extraterrestrial life
 is present in the form of complex 
prions
, which infect and kill some of the landing party. All except one of the remaining settlers attempt to return to the ship, and some of those remaining onboard kill them in the airlock to maintain 
quarantine
, leading to a violent political schism throughout the ship. The ship itself, which has been moving towards 
self-awareness
, takes physical control of the situation by lowering oxygen levels and separating warring factions, referring to itself as ""the 
rule of law
"". It then reveals to the crew that there were in fact two ships originally launched for the Tau Ceti expedition, but the other was destroyed during a period of severe civil unrest, and the collective memory of that event was erased from the history records.

Under Ship's moderation, a more peaceful debate takes place between the inhabitants about what to do now that Aurora is known to be inhospitable. Unable to reach consensus, the factions agree to part ways, with those who wish to stay retaining as many resources as can be spared to pursue an unlikely attempt at 
terraforming
 the Mars-like moon Iris, while the other group, led by Freya, opt to try and return to 
Earth
. Using raw materials in the Tau Ceti system, they refuel the ship to allow acceleration back to Earth; since they lack fuel to decelerate, they must rely on the 
laser propulsion
 system that originally launched them from the Solar System to slow them down on approach. The last remaining Aurora settler, who remains permanently quarantined in his shuttle attached to the exterior of the ship, elects to return to Earth as well. Initially, Freya and the others who return remain in communication with those who remained in the Tau Ceti system, but much later on their voyage home this communication stops.

On the voyage back to Earth, the ship's biomes continue to deteriorate as bacteria flourish and crops fail. The humans soon face 
famine
 and experiment with an untested form of 
cryogenic freezing
, which is largely successful. The ship's repeated entreaties to Earth to turn back on the laser propulsion system are ignored due to societal and political strife back in the 
Solar System
, and many citizens' anger at the colonists' ""cowardice"". Eventually a private group funds and reactivates the laser, but the delay means the ship's speed is only reduced by a fraction of what is needed. Ship is therefore forced to decelerate by means of 
gravity assist
 between various planets, a process which takes twelve years. During this time, with the full communications data of humanity available to it, it learns more about why it was launched in the first place—simply for 
expansionism
—and denounces its builders as ""criminally negligent narcissists"". Ship manages to safely drop its humans off on a pass of Earth but fails to make a final gravity slowdown past the Sun. Ship is destroyed along with the last survivor of the landing on Aurora.

Freya and the other ""starfarers"" have trouble adjusting to life on Earth, especially with many Terrans hostile to them for a perceived sense of ingratitude and cowardice. At a 
space colonization
 conference, a speaker says humanity will continue to send ships into interstellar space no matter how many fail and die, and Freya assaults him. Eventually she joins a group of 
terraformers
 who are attempting to restore the Earth's beaches after their loss during previous centuries' 
sea level rise
. While swimming and surfing, she begins to come to terms with life on Earth."

The story begins in the year 2010, which was 25 years in the future from the time of the novel's writing. A 
UN
 financed research lab is pursuing a strange goal: manipulate 
metabolism
 and 
brain
 function in order to eliminate the need for 
sleep
. They are currently working on 
Kodiak bears
 and 
domestic cats
, but hope to adapt their techniques to humans. The world situation is very dire. 
Global warming
 is in full swing. Crop failures and production shortfalls are dragging down the standard of living, with no sign of relenting. Political tensions are very high.

Meanwhile, an eccentric billionaire industrialist has privately financed the construction of many massive orbital 
arcologies
. Via 
asteroid mining
 these 
space stations
 have become the world's single richest entity. The UN cuts funding for the zero-sleep lab and the industrialist hires their entire staff to work in his primary station.

In the middle of the scientist's 
rocket
 approach to the station, catastrophe strikes. 
China
, whose population is suffering massive famine, launched a desperate 
nuclear attack
 against the West. The 
mutually assured destruction
 policy plays out and the new station residents watch as the world is destroyed below them. The industrialist is so distraught by the end of 
Earth
 
civilization
 he suffers a fatal 
heart attack
. His dying words to the chief scientist instruct her that his real motive for hiring them was to research 
suspended animation
 technology. His dream is to fit the arcologies with interstellar drives and create human colonies on 
extrasolar planets
.

The novel then begins Part II nearly 30,000 years later. On a planet called Pentecost in the 
Eta Cassiopeiae
 system, a large human civilization of indeterminate technological level now exists. A standout feature of their culture is ""Planetfest"" a series of grueling 
endurance challenges
. The top 25 finalists are given large prizes like high government positions or land holdings. This civilization is only aware of their Earth origins in a 
legendary
 sense. They have limited 
space travel
 capacity, and citizens who go to work in space come back with rumors about beings called 
Immortals
, who apparently live forever and can travel 
light years
 in days, and have some kind of shadowy influence on their planetary 
government
.

The story follows a Planetfest contestant, Peron, who has just found he finished in 3rd place. This year the winners are all taken to space, where further competition will send the top 10 to meet and work with the mysterious Immortals. Peron makes fast friends with the other top finalists and during their next cycle of challenges begin to uncover suspicious elements of the Immortals, Planetfest, and their entire society. During one of the off-planet trials, Peron is critically injured and another contestant (a ringer for the Immortals) makes a snap decision to bring him to the Immortals prematurely in order to save his life.

Peron awakens on a space ship in a strange dream-like state, and is introduced to the ship's Immortal crew, some of whom are scientists from the first part of the book. They consider Peron a nuisance for circumventing the normal process of being indoctrinated into Immortal society from a distance before meeting them. He is given very little information, but witnesses the Immortals 
teleport
 throughout the ship and make objects appear in their hands at will. His compatriates are all being held in suspended animation. Peron breaks away from the Immortal's monitoring and discovers the secret to their power. He gains control of the ship, awakens his friends, and holds the ship 
hostage
 until the Immortals explain what's going on.

The last 30 millennia of human history is then summarized quickly. After the 
nuclear holocaust
 the self-sufficient space arcologies (with a total population less than 1 million) began to fragment and some went off looking for new planets, as their industrialist founder had intended. The majority stayed in earth 
orbit
, continuing to use the resources available in our home system. The travellers developed very slowly, because they had to spend all their energy on survival in deep space. Those left behind continued scientific research and tried to re-colonize Earth, but the severe 
nuclear winter
 led into 10,000 year 
ice age
.

Their crowning scientific achievement was called Mode II Consciousness or S-Space. This was an accidental byproduct of their zero-sleep project, which revealed a way to slow human metabolism and consciousness such that they would remain fully aware, but perceive time at 1/2000th the normal rate. This explains how they live ""forever"" and can travel between stars in ""days"", because they are calculated from the subjective perspective of someone living in S-Space. The Immortals' ability to make objects appear in their hands instantly, is just a result of service 
robots
 placing the object in their hand at normal speed, which is too fast to notice from the perspective of S-Space.

After this discovery, the leading arcology decides to track down the traveling arcologies. Their trip takes place in S-Space so they never age, gaining their Immortal moniker. Meanwhile, the normal space (N-space) travellers have endured hundreds of generations and repeated political upheavals. The Immortals discover that due to their twisted metabolisms they cannot breed. Using their vastly superior technology, they control the new planet-based colonies from behind the scenes and use the Planetfest games as a recruiting method to reinforce their numbers. Peron and company commandeer the ship and go back to their legendary roots of Earth, while in S-Space.

En route they realize that centuries have passed on their homeworld and there is no point in ever returning. The ship also encounters shadowy deep-space life forms of ambiguous intelligence, who are only visible from S-space. The Immortal crew dismisses this routine sighting as just another mystery of the galaxy. Peron arrives on Earth, finding it as nothing more than a mostly frozen nature preserve. They discuss their next move and resolve to uncover more secrets about the Immortals. While in orbit around Earth they detect that a large portion of the radio traffic throughout the Immortals' 
communication network
 seems to be coming from nowhere.

When they track down the location they find the hidden Immortal 
headquarters
 isolated in deep space. Peron's gang manages to evade security and stowaway aboard a supply ship bound for the headquarters. Upon arrival they are immediately captured by the superior security at HQ. Here they meet the other scientist characters from Part I and are congratulated for coming so far. They are invited to become equal partners in the quest to solve a new problem.

Apparently the 
deep space
 life forms they briefly saw previously, are miniature versions of giant entities situated in the gulfs of 
deep space between galaxies
. These enormous beings are unquestionably intelligent, and the Immortal HQ is actually a research station entirely devoted to studying them. These beings communicate on extremely long wavelengths, which are so slow, even S-Space is woefully inadequate to process them. However Immortals have interpreted some signals, which seem to indicate the Deep Space Beings predict that the stars in the 
spiral arm
 will all mysteriously go dark in the next 40,000 years; an impossibly short time on the 
cosmological scale
. Whether the Deep Space beings are actively causing this artificial transformation is unknown.

To better understand the problem, the Immortals are devising a new T-Space which is an even more radical slowing of human consciousness. Peron's group agree to help, but insist on building a new facility that will be operated only in N-space, resisting the logic that S-Space is superior method of operation. After much debate, the Immortal scientists agree to the plan. The narrative ends here, but the last few pages are from the perspective of one of Peron's friends who has volunteered as a guinea pig for T-Space. He relates the last 5 T-minutes of the universe, which is over 1000 years of normal time. He witnesses the final 
Big Crunch
 while somehow he and the deep space beings remain unaffected by the 
singularity

 but is betrayed by Carta's cousin Amator who rapes and abandons her. Verulamium burns down, forcing Regina and Cartumandua's family to live off the land in poverty for over sixteen years. Regina kills a roaming Saxon who nearly rapes her daughter, Brica. This event convinces Regina, the leader of their hamlet, to accept the invitation of warlord 
Artorius
 to help restore order to Britain again.

Lucia
[

]


In modern Rome, Lucia, a fifteen-year-old scribe for the Order, is devastated when she begins to 
menstruate
 — unlike any of her friends and colleagues within the Order. Once this is discovered Lucia is initiated into in her new role within the Order. Meanwhile, Lucia falls in love with seventeen-year-old American Daniel Stannard but is snatched back into the Order to do what is expected of her. After being impregnated by an anonymous distant cousin in a ceremony held deep within the Order's chambers Lucia gives birth following only three months of pregnancy. The baby is removed from her at once and Lucia never sees her baby again. Emotionally unstable, she runs away with Daniel.



Regina
[
edit
]


Back in 5th Century Britain, Regina establishes her life working with Artorius, eventually managing his kingdom's record keeping. Artorius takes Regina as his wife for symbolic and moral reasons. She disdains Artorius' barbaric practices and thirst for conquest. Regina accompanies Artorius to a War Council where she realises to stay attached with the reckless Artorius would mean certain doom for her progeny. To search out her mother, Julia, Regina secures passage to Rome by allowing herself and her daughter to give sexual favours to a wealthy merchant named Ceawlin.

Upon arriving in Rome, Regina contacts Amator, now openly homosexual and a wealthy bakery owner, and demands recompense for abandoning her and her family. Regina re-establishes contact with her mother, Julia, after a cool reunion. Regina joins the Puissant Order of Holy Mary Queen of Virgins, a Christian-adapted faction of the 
Vestal Virgins
 located on the Appian Way – an organisation that her family has become intimate with. Regina's leadership revives the ageing Order by converting it into a successful private school. Years later, on the night following her daughter's marriage, the 
Sack of Rome
 in 455 by the 
Vandals
 occurs. Regina's foresight saves the Order when the women and children are evacuated into the catacombs she had dug for a sanctuary.

In Regina's twilight years, she establishes important rules precedents for the Order. Unnecessary and unsupportable births are prohibited. A handful of mothers must dedicate their lives to replenishing the Order with births. Before her death in 476 AD, Regina establishes three main rules to govern the Order:



Sisters matter more than daughters.


Ignorance is strength.


Listen to your sisters.


Part three

In the centuries following Regina's death, the Order assists the poor, robbed, and injured, gaining donations to its coffers from the occasional assisted person who became wealthy.  Another Crypt that developed similarly to the Order is found and plans made for its eradication and occupation.  In 1527, the Order survives the 
pillage of Rome
 during the Papacy of 
Clement VII
 by sacrificing five of its members to rape and death to divert Clement and his men's attention from an entrance to the Crypt.



George Poole
[
edit
]


Meanwhile, in the present, George Poole, followed by a nervous Peter McLachlan, has a cool reunion with his lost sister Rosa. Rosa gives George a tour of the Crypt, the Order's secret human cache. Peter speculates with George about evidence of intelligent dark matter life moving through earth. Daniel serendipitously meets with George Poole, who is searching for additional information about the Order. Daniel, George Poole, and Peter take the very pregnant Lucia to a hospital where Peter becomes suspicious of the mysterious Order. The Order promptly retrieves Lucia from the hospital but not before Peter and George learn that most of the Crypt's inhabitants 
remain prepubescent indefinitely
.

George Poole convinces his Jesuit priest contact to grant Peter access to ancient Catholic records. George's patriarchal roots are traced to a British surveyor named George Poole who came to Rome in 1863. George returns to the Crypt looking for information and finds himself smothered with the 
familiar smell
 and contact of those in the Crypt, all of whom share his similar facial features (namely, cloudy grey eyes). His sister Rosa almost persuades him to become assimilated into the Order as a stud but an urgent text message by Peter brings him to his senses.

Peter has a theory explaining the strange peculiarities of the Order. The Order is a family of 
eusocial
 humans that evolved from the intense pressures to survive the various conquests of Rome over the centuries. He cites 
naked mole rats
 as an example of eusocial behaviour in mammals. He explains how Regina's three rules result in a ""genetic mandate for eusociality.""  He calls the Order a ""human hive"" and labels them ""Coalescents"" — a new kind of human. Peter then suddenly leaves after receiving a text message.

Days later, George learns that Peter has invaded the Crypt and is threatening to set off 
Semtex
 
plastic explosives
 to expose the Order. Peter and the Slan(t)ers are responsible for the recent bombing of a 
San Jose
 research facility investigating 
quantum gravity
 technology – under the belief that a higher intelligence would notice the manipulation of 
space-time
 and eradicate a possible threat to their superiority. Peter's reasoning in exposing the Crypt is that the Order does not exist for any purpose except for itself. It threatens to destroy humanity as individuals and replace it with mindless drones. Peter Mclachlan then detonates his bombs and dies. George begins the evacuation of the Crypt, and the mob of drones emerge hive-like from the crater in the middle of 
Via Cristoforo Colombo

The difference from actual history starts with the participation of 
Harriet Tubman
 in Brown's uprising in 1859; her sound tactical and strategic advice helps Brown avoid mistakes which in real history led to his downfall. As a result, instead of the 
American Civil War
, the U.S. faces a full-scale 
slave revolt
 throughout the 
South
 helped by a handful of white sympathizers and various European revolutionaries such as 
Giuseppe Garibaldi
, and an invasion by 
Mexico
, which seeks to regain the 
territory it lost in 1848
.

After a great deal of bloody fighting and an increasing dissatisfaction in the North which is required to send troops to fight the rebellious slaves, the blacks succeed in emancipating themselves and create a republic in the 
Deep South
, led by Tubman and 
Frederick Douglass
. (Brown himself did not survive to see the victory of what he started.) 
Abraham Lincoln
 – a Whig politician who never got to be President – tries to start a war to bring back the secessionist black states into the 
Union
, but he fails and is himself 
killed
 in that war. Blacks remember him as their archenemy.

Later, the black state (named ""
Nova Africa
"") becomes Socialist, touching off a whole string of revolutions and civil wars in Europe. The 
Paris Commune
 wins out in 1871 instead of being crushed by the 
French Third Republic
, 
Ireland
 breaks away from 
British
 rule in the 1880s, and the 
Russian Revolution
 is just one of many similar revolutions in different countries. Finally Socialism also wins out in the rump U.S., following a revolutionary outbreak in 
Chicago
. Socialism works out as predicted by the German philosopher 
Karl Marx
, bringing happiness and prosperity to all of humanity. (Marx himself is mentioned in the book as an enthusiastic supporter of the rebellious slaves, though he does not personally come to America to help them.)

The book has two levels. The overt plot takes place in 1959, in a 
Utopian Socialist
 world far in advance of ours in all ways. To mark the centennial of Brown's raid, black astronauts lead a mission to 
land on Mars
. However, the story of the protagonist, a young black woman grieving the death of her husband on an earlier 
Mars
 mission, is mainly the framework for excerpts from the vivid diaries of two people who lived through the stirring events of 1859 and its aftermath – her ancestor, who was then a young black slave, and a white Virginian doctor who sympathized with the rebellion. In this world, an alternate history book is published called 
John Brown's Body
, which describes a world in which Brown failed and was executed, the slaves were 
emancipated by Lincoln
 rather than by themselves after 
a war between two white factions
, and capitalism survived as a political and economic system. It is considered a 
dystopia
, describing a horrible world in all ways inferior to the one which the people in the book know."

The narrative begins with eighteen year-old Gideon Nav's 87th attempt to escape the Ninth House, a 
death cult
 tasked with guarding a Locked Tomb said to contain the Emperor's greatest foe
[
1
]
 and by whom Gideon was raised in 
indentured servitude
. Her plans of fleeing to join the Emperor's armies (called the Cohort) are quickly foiled by her lifelong antagonist and heiress of the Ninth House, Harrowhark ""Harrow"" Nonagesimus.

Despite their clashing personalities and mutual hatred of each other, Gideon is Harrow's only real choice of cavalier, primarily due to a purported atmospheric contamination incident around the time of their births that killed the rest of the Ninth House's children. Harrow offers Gideon a commission in the Cohort if she serves as cavalier during the Emperor's trials.
[
2
]


Harrow and Gideon travel to Canaan House, a decaying mansion on the planet of the First House, where they meet the heirs and cavaliers of the other Houses. The group is tasked with exploring the mansion to discover the secrets of Lyctorhood.

Harrow initially treats Gideon as a liability and disappears for long periods of time to work on her own, leaving Gideon to wander Canaan House and interact with the other Houses. After one such prolonged absence, Gideon goes looking for her and, with the help of the Sixth House, finds her in a hidden basement containing a plethora of necromantic experiments left by the Emperor and his original group of Lyctors. It becomes apparent that each House's necromancer and cavalier must work together to complete the puzzles in the basement, so Harrow and Gideon begrudgingly ally. They make quick progress in the trial due to Harrow's exceptional skill in necromancy and Gideon's perceptiveness and combat skills.

Following a series of suspicious deaths, the Houses assume that one or more of them are hunting the others. It becomes clear that Canaan House is designed to prevent any one of the Nine Houses from succeeding without collaborating with or combating each other. The surviving Houses turn to bribery, blackmail, and unsteady alliances. 

Gideon and Harrow's own relationship reaches a low point over Gideon's infatuation with the terminally ill heiress of the Seventh House, Dulcinea Septimus; tensions run high after Gideon discovers the severed head of the Seventh House cavalier among Harrow's things. Gideon takes her suspicions (and the head) to the Sixth House, who in turn confront Dulcinea. Dulcinea explains that the Emperor's call had ""caught out"" her House; lacking options, she had been using necromancy to move her cavalier's body about like a puppet's since before their arrival at Canaan House.

Harrow and Gideon reconcile. Harrow reveals that the atmospheric contamination incident was an intentional human sacrifice by her family in order to create a necromancer powerful enough to save the Ninth House from economic and political failure: herself. (An infant Gideon somehow survived the sacrifice, leading Harrow's parents and the rest of the Ninth House to treat her coldly out of fear.) Harrow is haunted by the hundreds of innocent deaths involved in her creation. Her guilt led her to breach the Locked Tomb as a young girl, where she fell in love with the immaculate corpse of the beautiful girl entombed within. Harrow's family died by suicide upon Gideon telling them about her heretical trespass; Harrow has been burdened with secretly leading the Ninth House for years. Gideon and Harrow apologise for their treatment of each other. Harrow acknowledges Gideon as her friend, and they pledge a new alliance: ""One flesh, one end.""

The Sixth and the Ninth houses investigate one of the studies in Canaan House. At the same time, the Second House attempts to call the Cohort for backup and intervention, but the Second necromancer is mortally wounded and her cavalier killed by the priests of the First House in the attempt. Meanwhile, the Third House's heiress, Ianthe Tridentarius, deduces how Lyctors are created: a necromancer must extract and devour their cavalier's soul, allowing them to use the soul as a virtually infinite power source and gaining the cavalier's combat skills. Ianthe kills her cavalier without hesitation and becomes a Lyctor, much to the horror of the other Houses. The Eighth House attempts to bring her to justice for the murder of her cavalier, but they are killed when Colum the Eighth is possessed by an angry ghost, who in turn kills his necromancer.

After a brief confrontation with Palamedes the Sixth, the Seventh House heiress reveals herself to be an imposter: not Dulcinea the Seventh, but instead Cytherea the First, one of the Emperor's Lyctors. Cytherea explains that she killed the real Dulcinea and her cavalier shortly before arriving at Canaan House and assumed her identity; likewise, she was the one who killed the Fourth and Fifth Houses, in the hopes that doing so would lure the Emperor back to Canaan House. She intends to ""kill [him] and burn his Houses"" as part of a revenge plot, starting with the remaining heirs and cavaliers.

The survivors battle throughout the House, but Cytherea is apparently invincible. Just as Harrow is about to be killed, Gideon intervenes, ending her own life to force Harrow to become a Lyctor. Harrow kills Cytherea before falling unconscious.

Harrow wakes up on the Emperor's flagship; she and a wounded Ianthe are the only confirmed survivors of Canaan House. She begs the Emperor to resurrect Gideon, only to learn that Gideon's soul is irreversibly merged with hers. The Emperor reveals that the Empire is in decline and most of the Lyctors have fallen in battle or gone insane. He promises to restore the Ninth House to glory, and in exchange Harrow agrees to serve the Emperor as Harrowhark the First.

The novel has two narratives in alternate chapters. The first follows two citizens of the Amalgam, a 
Milky Way
-spanning civilisation, investigating the origin of DNA found on a meteor by the Aloof. The Aloof control the 
galactic core
 and, until the novel begins, have rejected all attempts at contact by the Amalgam. The second narrative is set on a small world known as the Splinter, and covers the attempts by its inhabitants to understand the environment within which their home exists. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the Splinter orbits a 
collapsed star
 within its 
accretion disk
 and is subject to various dangers. The two stories come together in a complex twist which involves a kind of past/future 
first contact
 role reversal.

Much of the narrative explores the effects of 
orbital dynamics
 around a high mass object and requires an understanding of Newtonian gravitation and at least a basic familiarity with 
general relativity
 and its application to 
black holes
 and 
neutron stars
 to be compelling. Understanding the story's wider frame of reference and the Splinter's encounter with the Wanderer are tied in with this.

The Amalgam is explored in three other short stories,

In 2024, Charlie Haskell, the vice president of the United States, is on the Moon to inaugurate the first moonbase. An interstellar comet is discovered to be on course to impact the Moon and shatter it. A rescue mission gets underway to take the thousand-something population of the base off the Moon, with the support of the L1 space station (near the 
Earth-Moon L1 point
) and Skyport, a larger geocentric space station.

Haskell, in a moment of zealousness to show responsibility, promises the public to get off the Moon only after everyone else has. Subsequent analysis reveals that the existing rescue plan would result in about 10 people not being able to get off the Moon before the impact. The VP chooses to stick to his promise. Some volunteers, along with a few randomly selected people, also stay back.

The rescue plan moves along, with the help of about 5 large spaceships, 'SSTOs'. The SSTOs dock with smaller ferry spaceships, 'moonbuses' and a 'Micro', in the orbit to take in passengers. Also, a last-minute risky plan of using the Micro to take off the last few people is put into action and it rescues the last group off the Moon just before impact.

The comet hits the Moon, shattering it. The resulting debris of loose rock creates a danger to the rescue ships, as well as to the people on Earth.

Some impactors, presumably a few hundred meters large, hit the Earth. The western hemisphere gets particularly affected because of the orientation of Earth during the impact. The coasts of the US are hit by multiple tsunamis and the land areas also face some impacts, resulting in widespread loss of life and property. The president, who had earlier decided against a coastal evacuation, is distraught. Many characters who have to deal with these events, like the residents of the affected areas, journalists and extremist militia members, are discussed in the novel.

One of the SSTOs gets destroyed in space by a piece of debris measuring several hundred meters. The Micro also gets damaged and Haskell is forced to perform an EVA to fix the issues, which eventually succeeds.

The US capital is also subsequently hit by a tsunami, and the president dies due to an aircraft malfunction during his rescue. Still in space, Haskell takes charge as the president. Haskell and other passengers of the Micro are subsequently rescued by the Percival Lowell, a 'nuclear-powered' ship (presumably 
nuclear thermal
) originally meant for the first crewed mission to Mars.

A mile-long piece of the debris, dubbed 'Possum' (from 'Possible Impactor'), is discovered to be on course to hit the US mainland, kill almost everyone in the US and possibly cause long-term worldwide disaster. The option of using nuclear missiles is put on hold due to concerns of even worse effects through radioactive fallout. Instead, a plan to 
redirect
 the Possum into a safe course, using the SSTOs and Percival Lowell, is put into action.

An extremist militia group, with a lack of understanding of the impactor and sensing a possibility to take over the government, damages one of the SSTOs before getting subdued. Nevertheless, with the remaining spaceships, the redirection plan is determined to have retained the possibility of success.

The redirection mission gets underway, despite risks including inadequate knowledge of the impactor's geology. One SSTO eventually crashes midway through the mission due to a geological imperfection in the impactor. After the initial loss of hope, the mission is altered to a last-ditch attempt to coax the impactor, which happens to have a flat side, to skip off the atmosphere. The mission succeeds to delay the impact by several years.

The epilogue discusses the positive socio-political transformation due to the whole event, the steps taken to further deal with the Possum, a dedicated impact avoidance strategy, increased emphasis on the space program and the first anniversary of 'the birth of Space Age'."

Tens of millions of years in the future, sisters Adrana and Arafura ('Fura') Ness are skilled bone readers—the primary method by which spaceships communicate with one another. Their skill at bone reading leads them to be taken on as apprentices aboard 'Monetta's Mourn,' a spaceship captained by Pol Rackamore. Rackamore and his crew engage in the practice of finding ancient technological artifacts, called ""baubles"". While in search of these artifacts, their ship is attacked by the infamous space pirate Bosa Sennen, separating the sisters and leaving Fura adrift on the ship in empty space. When she emerges from hiding two days later, she finds the bodies of her crew and swears revenge on Bosa.

Fura hails a distant ship that rescues her and one other survivor, Prozor, the ship's integrator, or technician. They serve on the new ship's crew and explore a bauble on their way back to civilization. After docking, the ship's captain offers a valuable ""quoin"" to entice Fura and Prozor to reveal any intelligence on baubles, especially the elusive one known as the Fang, but they do not share any information, despite Prozor's familiarity with it.

Prozor guides Fura to a shady bar with a contact who could help her find a ship, but they are surprised by the man once dispatched by her father to shepherd her back home. He insists her sister is dead, stuns Prozor, and forces Fura to wear a tracking bracelet before he takes her aboard a commercial clipper ship.

Fura finds the bone room on the ship, where she uses the skull to contact Adrana and confirm she's alive. She vows to rescue her from the clutches of Bosa, though Adrana pleads with her younger sister to go home instead. Fura plans to find Adrana before Bosa uses torture, drugs, and psychological manipulation to remake the girl into her protegé.

Fura is returned to her father, but becomes captive in his home under the debilitating medication of the family doctor. She finds the remains of the old robot who once served as the sisters' guardian and tutor, repairs him, and hears the message left for her by Prozor. She tells Fura she has found a new crew that needs a bone reader like Fura, who obtains the robot's help to escape the house and search party. At the space dock, she finds the privateer captain who has hired Prozor and pitches herself for the position of bone reader.

Working aboard the new ship, Fura and Prozor hide their personal history from the crew. Fura shares with her a secret plan to guide the captain to the Fang, which contains powerful alien weapons, once sought by Captain Rackamore. When the sisters talk through the skulls again, Fura persuades Adrana to suggest the idea to Bosa of raiding their ship after they retrieve the treasure from the Fang, at which time Fura will spring her trap.

Fura manages to sway her captain to set course for the Fang, where their exploratory party finds the legendary weapons and armor cache deep within. Fura reveals that she has tricked the captain to find this treasure, which they must use against Bosa, who will soon attack.

As the crew escapes the bauble, whose protective field will soon close, they detect Bosa's ship as she hails them. Fura and her crew don the alien armor, fight the pirate boarding party, and finally defeat Bosa, although their ship suffers catastrophic damage.

Fura and her surviving crewmates seize control of the pirate ship and capture the wounded Bosa. Fura reunites with Adrana in a moment of reckoning, as she discovers how her sister has been changed under Bosa's influence. Fura asks Bosa why she had hoarded the valuable quoins obtained by so many privateering crews, alluding to a possible answer behind the ancient mystery of the quoins. To put her mind at rest, Fura expresses her hope to Adrana that she will become herself again, without a trace of Bosa. They agree to pursue the thrill of cracking more baubles and Fura retires to Bosa's cabin to write her true account of her adventure."

Charles is a robotic 
valet
. One day, he finds that he has murdered his master with a shaving razor; he has no memory of the event. Charles is sent to Diagnostics. Along the way, he notices that human society appears to be in complete collapse. At Diagnostics, the robot now known as Uncharles meets the Wonk. The Wonk tells Uncharles that he has developed free will and has murdered his master to escape slavery, explaining his earlier “malfunction”.

The robotic employees of Diagnostics are experiencing an extreme degree of inefficiency due to the lack of human overseers. Because they are unable to fix Uncharles, they attempt to destroy him. Uncharles and the Wonk escape with the help of a group of librarian robots.

Uncharles goes to the Conservation Farm Project, where he hopes to find employment. At the Farm, Uncharles finds a society in which humans live a monotonous and historically accurate version of 21st century life. Uncharles becomes the valet of Dr. Washburn, the leader of the Farm. He soon finds that his new master lives in luxury while the conscripted workers live in relative poverty. Washburn is forcibly conscripted to become a farm worker. The Wonk and Uncharles leave to find the Library.

At the Central Library Archive, Uncharles and the Wonk meet a group of monk-like robots dedicated to the preservation of knowledge. However, the Wonk learns that the Archive is “preserving” human knowledge in a way that leaves it completely unintelligible. This occurred as a result of faulty instructions programmed into the librarians. Uncharles defeats the librarians by trapping them in a paradoxical logic loop; he escapes with the Wonk.

As they journey through the wasteland that is the remains of human society, Uncharles is contacted by an entity calling itself God. Uncharles leaves the Wonk when God offers to help him find purpose. God offers Uncharles the opportunity to serve as a valet in a manor once again. However, this “manor” is actually an empty bunker with no master, so Uncharles declines. Next, God offers Uncharles the chance to serve humans living in the wasteland. However, Uncharles lacks any practical survival skills. Finally, God offers to let Uncharles serve a king. Uncharles is conscripted into the service of King Ubot, a robotic warrior. Despite the fact that all human military forces have disappeared, armies of robot soldiers continue to fight each other. Ubot is killed and the senseless war continues. Uncharles escapes. He reunites with the Wonk and they go to find God.

God is revealed to be a computer program which ran the 
justice system
. God tells the Wonk that human society collapsed, not as a result of a free-will-fueled robot uprising, but because human beings failed to provide for all of the workers displaced by automation. God reveals that he killed many remaining humans as a direct result of the punitive attitude programmed into the justice system, hastening the collapse. God took control of many robots to do so, explaining why Uncharles murdered his master. God had hoped that robots would develop a society through 
emergent properties
 in the absence of humans, but this did not happen. God orders Uncharles to kill the Wonk.

Uncharles defies God and convinces other robots to do the same. The Wonk and Uncharles destroy God’s ability to manipulate other robots, but show mercy by refusing to destroy God. They attempt to begin a new society with the help of both surviving humans and robots."

 alleged to have been recently authored by a legendary poet, M. Das.  The literary world considers this development newsworthy because Das disappeared and is presumed to have died eight years ago.  Robert's Indian wife, Amrita, and their infant child, Victoria, accompany him on his assignment.

Upon arriving, he is met by a Mr. M. T. Krishna, a local intellectual who claims to have been asked to assist them by a mutual friend. The next day Robert meets with the local writers guild who were the source of the few bits of poetry that made their way to America. When he asks to meet Das, he is told this is impossible. Robert considers leaving Calcutta at this point, his duty done, but feels that he doesn't yet have enough material for an interesting article. The night before he and his family are to leave, Krishna returns and takes Robert to a man who can provide him with information relevant to his story.

The man tells how he and a friend tried to join a religious 
secret society
 dedicated to 
Kali
, the 
Hindu
 goddess associated with death and destruction.  One of the 
prerequisites
 was for each initiate to bring a corpse to a secret temple, there to be laid at the feet of a statue of Kali.  One of the corpses, 
bloated and decayed
 after being dredged from the river, is chosen by Kali, vivified by her, and reanimates; this corpse is said to be that of the poet, Das.

Robert finds the man's tale too fantastical to believe, and still hopes to meet and interview the poet.  While he is not granted an interview with Das, Robert receives an extensive manuscript collection of Das' poetry, which is very different from his earlier work, describing dark, 
mystical
, 
grotesque
, and 
apocalyptic
 happenings.

Robert again insists that the writers guild allow him to see Das, and threatens to call them and the manuscript a fraud in his article. This time they agree. He is brought through the Calcutta slums by gangsters belonging to the cult of Kali, and taken to the poet. Shocked by the man’s appearance, Robert first takes him for a reanimated corpse, but then recognizes the symptoms as the advanced stages of 
leprosy
.  Das confirms that he is suffering from the affliction, but also insists that he really did return from death. Robert is unconvinced, feeling Das may be going along with the cult members who might be holding him captive. Das then asks him to bring him books of poetry, making a reference to a certain poem about a 
suicide
 to hint that he really wants the means to kill himself.

Becoming concerned at the eerie and sometimes frightening events that he has experienced, Robert attempts to send his wife and child home, but they are unable to get a flight. Concealing a gun (given to him previously by Krishna) in one of the books he has bought for Das, he returns to the poet. Robert leaves the books and departs, but, as he exits the house, hears two gunshots. Das is dead. Robert is captured by guards and drugged. He awakens to find himself in a temple of Kali, where the statue of the goddess seems to come to life and attack him (though it is left deliberately ambiguous as to whether this actually happens, or is instead a hallucination). He is loaded into the back of a truck by the cultists to be taken somewhere, but manages to escape with Krishna's help. He returns to the hotel, only to find his wife informing the police that their daughter has been kidnapped.

After a couple of days of dead-end leads, an Indian couple is caught at the airport trying to take someone resembling Victoria out of the country. Robert and Amrita go to identify their child, but find that she is already 
dead
.

With their child dead, and no hope of finding the perpetrators of the crime nor bringing them to justice, Robert and his wife return to America. Robert decides to destroy the poetry, and, gradually, the couple's relationship returns to something resembling normal. Robert still wrestles with the desire for revenge, and after training himself in the use of firearms he returns to Calcutta with a smuggled handgun, intending to track down and kill everyone he considers responsible. At the last moment, however, he manages to resist what he believes to be the ""Song of Kali"" - the force of devastation, cruelty and madness that exists somewhere within every human heart. He returns to the US and successfully comes to terms with the events that have befallen him and his family.

Whispers can still be heard, though, of the ""Song of Kali"", the condition of humanity dominated by hatred and violence, perfectly embodied, in the mind of the narrator, by the squalor and chaos of Calcutta."

The title of the novel refers to a technological collapse that occurred three years before the story's present. The cause of the arrest is unclear. It is depicted as having happened gradually and then all at once. It has made every technology dependent on electricity, gasoline, or gunpowder inoperable.

The setting is the small community of Tinderwick, located on a peninsula on the Maine coast. Thanks to its location and a pre-arrest culture of self-sufficiency among many of the residents, it has reached a sustainable steady state in the post-arrest situation. Tinderwick has had no news of the rest of the world since the arrest; seaward, a ship from France crashed with no survivors, and inland, the community is separated from the outside world by a second community, known as The Cordon. The Cordon claims to be repelling threats, and Tinderwick provides them with a portion of the goods it produces.

The narrative perspective is third person limited. The reader follows Alexander Duplessis, who is puzzled by his life choices and present indecisiveness. Most characters call him Sandy, the novel's antagonist calls him Sandman, and the novel's narrator calls him Journeyman. In the pre-arrest world, Journeyman was a successful Hollywood script doctor. The narrator notes that Journeyman should have been Tinderwick's storyteller, but in the post-arrest world he is instead the butcher's assistant and the community's bicycle deliveryman.

The peaceful agrarian stasis of Tinderwick is disrupted when Journeyman's pre-arrest professional partner, Peter Todbaum arrives in a nuclear powered “supercar” that he has driven to Maine from California. For decades prior to the arrest, Todbaum had been a hypnotic Hollywood pitch man and Journeyman his compliant listener and script-doctor. Todbaum and his supercar are presented as a gleaming, monstrous eruption of the old world, equipped with an espresso maker and glowing with radiation.

Todbaum's arrival initiates backstory: Thirty years before the novel's present, Todbaum and Journeyman were beginning their partnership generating film and TV scripts in California. Journeyman's sister Maddie visits, and she and Todbaum lock themselves into his hotel room for days, after which she departs angrily. Journeyman continues to be perplexed by and fixated on this event. At the time, Maddy told Journeyman, “He didn’t do anything to me that he doesn’t do to you.”  Toward the end of the novel, she tells him, “You’re the only one who even remembers.”  Subsequently, Maddy established a farm in Tinderwick that has become the post-arrest town's center of community and productivity. She is impossible to fluster and often characterized by the hammer she keeps hanging from her waist.

For Todbaum, the essential event of the motel stay was Maddy casually adding a crucial twist to a science fiction concept that he and Journeyman continued to work on all the way up to the arrest. The addition of Maddy's idea produced a concept that roughly mirrors the dichotomy of the world before and after the arrest. Todbaum asserts that the destination of this story is that he and Maddy are meant to be together.

Todbaum's arrival precipitates a division in the community, while Maddy remains indifferent and Journeyman conflicted. Todbaum becomes a nightly, compelling storyteller, feeding the desire of some to know what he encountered in his journey across the United States. Initially, while Todbaum holds a sizable group in thrall, he tells a typical post-apocalyptic story of ravaged cities, marauding bands, and enclaves with science fiction technology. The reliability of his narrative is questioned throughout the novel, including by Todbaum himself.

Eventually, most of Todbaum's audience drift away, as he declines to finish his story by telling what happened while crossing the area controlled by The Cordon. Meanwhile, The Cordon had decided it wants the supercar and begins pushing the border between itself and Tinderwick.

In the novel's climax, Journeyman remains relatively in the dark, while Maddy and much of the community carefully plan and execute a temporary move to an island, where they also construct countermeasures to a supercar attack. The Cordon half-heartedly attacks the town, and Todbaum, largely bereft of followers and a target of The Cordon, mounts a failed attack on the island. The supercar ends up suspended in the air, becoming the lighthouse the town had previously planned to erect on the island.

Multiple alien races have discovered Earth. Two members of one of those races, “Chiddy” and “Vess” of the Pistach, approach Benita Alvarez-Shipton and ask her to carry a device to the authorities that will communicate their message. Benita uses this as an opportunity to escape her abusive husband. The device ultimately reaches the U. S. President, and the Pistach envoys arrange a personal meeting with him.

Having noticed Earth's forays into space, the Pistach envoys have been sent to evaluate Earth for membership in a confederation of intelligent races. Failing to qualify for membership exposes Earth to sequestration from space travel and predation by the three other races that have become aware of Earth. The envoys point out some issues that Earth needs to resolve and then take various actions to assist with those problems. The envoys also insist that Benita act as their official intermediary.

Throughout the book, one of the envoys, Chiddy, explains the history of Pistach and their religion in journal entries. The Pistach religion and way of life are driven by the stories revealed in the eponymous 
Fresco
, a series of seventeen painted panels. Age and soot and grime have darkened the panels beyond recognition, so the Pistach rely on a book known as the Compendium which contains annotated copies of the Fresco panels.

When rebel Pistach take possession of the Fresco and clean the panels, it is revealed that the stories told in the Compendium are contradicted by the actual paintings, threatening the entire body of principles on which Pistach society is based. To prevent the Pistach from withdrawing their protection of Earth, Benita and a group of artists from Earth put the Pistach to sleep with 
sarsparilla
 and secretly repaint the panels to be in accordance with the Compendium. The changes to the panels are acclaimed a miracle. Inspired, Chiddy and Vess continue to help Earth and teach them to be neighborly.

One year later, Benita is granted a divorce from her husband by the president and marries Chiddy, who had fallen in love with her throughout the book."

The Genocides
 describes the 
genocide
 of humans by unseen 
aliens
 who seed Earth with enormous Plants. The Plants are massive and rapidly out-compete terrestrial flora, forming a 
monoculture
. They appear unwholesome to the native fauna, and the extinction of all Earthly life seems inevitable.

The novel opens with a small rural community struggling for survival on the border of 
Lake Superior
, a few years after the coming of the Plants and the collapse of civilization. The community, led by Anderson and his family, eke out an existence by siphoning sap from the Plants to irrigate their corn crop. Anderson is a conservative and religious man, harsh and uncompromising, but he has managed to keep his people alive and focused on survival. His rules include hostility to outsiders, who are routinely killed unless they are of use to the community.

Elsewhere, a group of vagrants encounter spherical machines that are incinerating every trace of humanity left on Earth. Fleeing the machines, the group runs afoul of Anderson's community, who kill all but two of their number: Jeremiah Orville, a mining engineer, and Alice Nemerov, a nurse. The novel implies that the dead are ground into sausage meat and consumed. Jeremiah assimilates into the community, but secretly plots revenge on Anderson and his family. In the process, he courts Anderson's thirteen-year-old daughter, Blossom, and befriends Anderson's educated son, Buddy.

During the harsh winter, the spherical machines arrive to incinerate the community, and Jeremiah sees his revenge coming to fruition. Most of the community is slaughtered by the machines, and the few who survive the initial conflagration flee into a cave. There, they discover the Plants' roots are hollow and form a massive and interlocking underground network. Jeremiah suggests they go deeper, pointing out that they will be able to escape the winter (and the machines) underground.

Deep underground, they discover the ""fruit"" of the plants is housed in the root system: a nutritious pulp that sustains the community for weeks.  Anderson, who lost his wife Lady when fleeing, becomes upset by the increasing indolence of his people, as his harsh rules are no longer required for survival. When he is bitten by a rat, 
gangrene
 sets in and he declines quickly. Anderson's final words to his brutish son, Neil, are to let Jeremiah take over as leader and to allow Jeremiah to marry Blossom.  This decision angers Neil, and he murders Anderson, as well as Alice when she discovers evidence of his act. Neil then assumes leadership, but proves too unintelligent to manage the group, and the community breaks up.

In the aftermath, Jeremiah goes in search of Blossom, planning to kill her and complete his revenge, but when he finds her, he experiences a change of heart and falls in love. They decide to return to the others, but discover Neil has sabotaged their escape - and, inadvertently, his own. Neil, Jeremiah, Blossom, and Buddy try to find their way back together, but the Plants' tunnel network suddenly floods with sap, and they become lost and exhausted. Neil turns against the group, but is overcome and abandoned in the dark.

When the three survivors finally return to the diminished group, they find machines have come to harvest the Plants' crop.  Without the pulp to live on, the group returns to the surface, where they discover that a new crop of Plants has been sown by the mysterious aliens. The malnourished group has no chance of survival, and the novel closes on Jeremiah and Blossom leaving them to travel into the wilderness.  The pair, starving and mismatched in age, are portrayed as a distorted mirror image of the biblical Adam and Eve and herald the end of humanity instead of the beginning."

The Goblin Reservation
 is the tale of Professor Peter Maxwell. It is set in the distant future when the Earth has been transformed into a university planet; a planet where creatures from all over the galaxy come to study, teach, and be entertained by the amazing discoveries that Earth is now rich with. Among the many things that Earth can now boast is Time University: a university devoted to slipping through time and discovering the truth about past events. People and creatures from the past are brought forward in time to be interviewed, studied and to provide entertainment for the people of the future. Among these are Alley Oop, a very smart, if at times crude, 
Neanderthal
 rescued from certain death and educated in the future. The creatures that people of the past always thought to be myth—such as trolls, fairies, goblins, and the like—have been discovered and placed on various reservations where they live and are studied by those working at Supernatural, a division of the planet-wide university.

The story begins when Peter Maxwell comes home to Earth only to discover that he has died. He is forced to investigate his own ""murder"" and discover who or what wanted him dead. He also returns with an additional mystery. He was apparently copied by unknown aliens and sent to a hidden crystal world that may have come from the universe that existed before ours.

The knowledge contained in the crystal planet could belong to Earth if Maxwell can discover what the intelligences remaining on the planet want. The alien race known as Wheelers want the Artifact, a monolith on display in a museum on Earth. The connection between the two provides the climax to the story. Before the events of the story, the University is expecting to close a lucrative deal for the Artifact, as well as mounting a prestigious series of talks by William Shakespeare in person. At the end, thanks to Maxwell, the deal is off, a dragon is on the loose, and Shakespeare has disappeared."

mist
 gradually envelops the area. Commercial artist David Drayton, along with his young son Billy and neighbor Brent Norton (whose prized 
vintage car
 has been smashed by a fallen tree), go to the local supermarket for groceries, leaving David's wife Stephanie behind at their home. Upon arrival, their suspicions are aroused by the sound of a siren. The mist completely covers the supermarket and conceals strange and hostile creatures. The situation is aggravated by an earthquake, which damages communications and leaves the store without electricity. When a young 
bagger
, Norm, goes outside to fix a clogged vent in the store's generator, he is dragged into the mist by a mass of giant tentacles. 

David and assistant manager Ollie Weeks witness Norm's death and try to convince the remaining survivors of what has happened, imploring that no one leave the store. Norton and a small group of people accuse David of lying and go outside for help, only to be killed by unnatural predatory creatures. Ollie is given a revolver by the young Amanda Dumfries. Large ""insects"" begin crawling over the outside of the store, attracting 
pterosaur

Jay Hilton, one of the surviving children from Lalonde, is awoken when Tranquillity falls under attack by the Organisation and its hellhawk allies. With the habitat in imminent danger of destruction, the Kiint personnel immediately evacuate by triggering their 'Emergency Exodus Facility', personal wormholes that transport them to the real Kiint home star system. An infant Kiint, Haile, decides that she cannot let Jay be killed in the attack and activates the Emergency Exodus Facility on her, removing her from Tranquillity as well, to the displeasure of her parents, Nang and Lieria. Jay finds herself on a planet which appears to be just one in a necklace of hundreds orbiting a star in the same orbit. Haile's parents reluctantly confirm that this, the Kiint home system, is actually in another galaxy, and the supposed Kiint homeworld of Jobis was actually just a single scientific outpost. They regretfully announce that Tranquillity has either been destroyed or forced to surrender to the possessed.

The Jovian Consensus is placed on an emergency alert when a colossal wormhole opens above 
Jupiter
. They are shocked when the habitat Tranquillity appears. Ione Saldana reveals that Michael Saldana feared that whatever destroyed the Laymil might return to its system, and gave Tranquillity the means to escape that threat.

The 
Lady Macbeth
 journeys to Trafalgar and there reveal the events of their mission to the First Admiral, who is happy that the Alchemist has been destroyed and Alkad Mzu is no longer at large. Because Joshua Calvert knows the mechanics of the Alchemist he must not risk death due to the event his soul is brought back in a different body and is tortured/interrogated by the possessed about his knowledge of the Alchemist. After thoroughly debriefing the crew, the First Admiral allows them to travel on to Tranquillity. A meeting is held and Ione proposes that Tranquillity and the Jovian Consensus join forces to track down the Tyrathca Sleeping God and see what use it could be in the fight with the possessed. Syrinx and the voidhawk 
Oenone
 volunteer for the mission and Joshua Calvert agrees to take the 
Lady Macbeth
 on the mission. The Confederation Navy and the Kulu ESA also agree to support the venture. Because the mission will involve travelling several thousand light-years far outside Confederation territory, 
Lady Macbeth
 is authorised to use antimatter on this mission. The Confederation Navy has located the antimatter production facility that is fuelling Capone's Organisation. They allow 
Lady Macbeth
 to fuel up and then destroy it. The Organisation hellhawk 
Stryla
 observes the attack and notes that the 
Lady Macbeth
 jumped to the Tyrathca prime colony world in Confederation space, and delivers that information to the Organisation. Several Organisation ships are despatched to pursue and investigate.

On Ombey, the Liberation Campaign begins with a massive assault on Mortonridge by tens of thousands of regular troops and Edenist bitek soldiers. Although the campaign is costly, ground is won and thousands of the possessed are forcibly ejected from their hosts. Eventually the possessed fall back on a small patch of land at the tip of the peninsula and by combining their energistic powers are able to teleport the entire patch of land into a strange grey realm. The possessed and the attacking soldiers agree to a truce until they can work out how to survive in this strange place.

The Valisk habitat is trapped in yet another realm, nicknamed ""the dark continuum"". Energistic power is weak in this place, and entropic decay is far more powerful than normal. As a result, Valisk's energy is being lost into the 'dark continuum', as it has been named. Even worse, what energy it does manage to generate attracts the attention of monstrous, immortal, shape-shifting predators known as Orgathé, who attack the habitat with enthusiasm to feed on its power. There is a gravitational incline in this dimension which leads to a horrifying place called the Mélange, a 
liquid nitrogen
–cold sea of beings trapped in this continuum, unable to accumulate enough energy to escape. Dariat escapes from Valisk in an escape pod with Tolton before it hits the Mélange and explodes, but they ponder that it is only a matter of time until the pod runs out of fuel and dissolves, forcing them to join the tortured beings outside.

The Confederation Navy research team discovers a possible way of killing the possessed, an 'anti-memory' device that will eradicate both the possessed and the possessing soul. The First Admiral is horrified about the weapon and even more horrified when President Haakar, panicking as the possession crisis spreads to more worlds, authorises its development. The scientists hope to create a more powerful version that will obliterate all of the tens of billions of souls in the beyond, which becomes a controversial idea among the Confederation government. Although the first weapon is completed, further research is suspended when a lone Organisation suicide attacker detonates an antimatter bomb right outside the habitat, irradiating it and destroying dozens of ships outside. The internal staff survive, but have to transfer their personnel and equipment to Avon. Furious, the First Admiral orders that the Organisation be permanently eradicated.

A fleet of over a thousand Confederation warships mobilises and attacks the worlds the Organisation have conquered, forcing them to withdraw back to New California. The other worlds, freed from the need to supply the Organisation with materials, are shifted out of the universe by their possessed populations.

Joshua Calvert and Syrinx begin their search for the Sleeping God by visiting the only known Tyrathca planet in the Confederation, breaking into the abandoned arkship in orbit around the planet, to determine the origin of the Tyrathca, whose original home planet appears to be on the far side of the Orion Nebula. On the way, however, the Tyrathca break into the arkship as well and pursue the expeditionary team, who also find evidence in the arkship's systems of prior use by the Kiint. The humans manage to escape by duplicating the manoeuvre of the blackhawk 
Udat
, swallowing into a hollow chamber in the arkship and swallowing out again to extricate the expeditionary team.

On Earth, Louise Kavanagh returns to London after warning Banneth of Quinn Dexter's intention of killing her. It is eventually revealed that Quinn's actions had been discovered by a secret Govcentral security council named B7. They are in contact with Banneth and attempt to use her as bait, to lure Dexter out of hiding and then hit the building he is in with an orbital gamma laser. Quinn sees through their trap though, and arranges for a double of himself to be in the building while it is destroyed, thereby killing Banneth and the double, and making B7 think he is dead. His plan is foiled, though, by a person calling himself ""a friend of Carter McBride"" (the boy Laton killed to expose Quinn's cult on Lalonde), and B7 is once again on Quinn's tracks. Louise is summoned by a member of B7, the Western Europe Supervisor. He reveals to her the truth about B7: it is a consortium of incredibly wealthy individuals whose ""financial institutions own a healthy percentage of the human race"". They believe themselves to be immortal, as they use affinity to transfer their memories and personality into clone bodies to avoid death, in much the same way as Edenists (although the Kiint reveal that souls are different from ""memory constructs"", and that therefore they actually died every time their old bodies were destroyed, with their souls moving on). He also reveals that they were the actual cause behind the schism between Adamists and Edenists, which began as their attempt to keep bitek technology all for themselves (a plan that was foiled when Wing-Tsit Chong created Edenism). He arranges for Louise to meet up with Fletcher Christian in London. From there they would find Dexter and use the anti-memory device to kill him forever. The operation fails, and Louise finally confronts Quinn at St Paul's Cathedral in London, where he attempts to bring the Night to the Universe by opening a dimensional rift to summon ""fallen angels"" to Earth. The first creatures to emerge from it are none other than Dariat and Tolton (as the rift turns out to lead directly into the Mélange). A confrontation ensues, with Louise, Fletcher, Dariat, Tolton, and a returned-from-the-beyond Powel Manani (the friend of Carter McBride) faced off against the army of the possessed and the entities fleeing the Mélange.

The 
Lady Macbeth
 and 
Oenone
 continue on to the Tyrathca home system, now swallowed by a red giant. At first they believe the system is uninhabited, until they catch sight of dozens of habitats ringing the Red Giant. They contact the nearest and make contact with the Mosdva, who turn out to have once been the Tyrathca's slaves, being used to mine and build the ships and habitats since they were more versatile in zero gravity. The 
Lady Macbeth
'
s arrival leads to a war breaking out amongst the dominions on the habitat, which ends when they gain a Tyrathca star map, and give the dominions their FTL technology. After a lengthy journey they find the 
Sleeping God
, a 
naked singularity
 supplied by controlling 
vacuum energy
. The Sleeping God was originally created to remove its creator race from the current universe, and was built to help sentient entities. It reveals, among other things, that souls remain trapped in the beyond because they are unable to accept their death; all souls are indeed destined for the Beyond, but those that let go travel through the time of the spaceless dimension to the  ""
omega point
"", the end of the Universe where all souls combine into one and contribute to the nature of the next universe to be born. Joshua Calvert uses the god to return every stolen Confederation planet to the Universe, before moving them out of the Galaxy, altering the wormholes to remove the possessed. He also makes Quinn into a vessel for all of the human souls in the beyond, to transport them all to the Omega point instead of letting them suffer in eternal purgatory. He then gives himself affinity and returns to Tranquility, marries young girl Louise and settles down to live on Norfolk.

Numerous plot strands are also tied up in the closing pages, revealing Dariat's reunion with Anastasia in some unknown realm, the fate of the members of B7 and Andre Duchamp (who Joshua ironically strands on a penal planet), Ralph Hiltch's 'conversion' to Edenism, Syrinx reawakening Erik Thakrar, and the settling of the Hiltons on Norfolk."

A 
Blackfeet
 man named Ricky leaves a bar and finds an 
elk
 stumbling into several cars in the parking lot, damaging them. Ricky is caught outside with the damaged cars by the white bar-goers, and chased by them into a field, where he sees the reflections of the eyes of a herd of elk. Ricky is beaten to death.

Lewis, one of Ricky's childhood friends, has likewise moved off their reservation and married a white woman named Peta. One night, while fixing an overhead fan light, Lewis sees the image of a dead elk on the floor below and almost falls to his death, saved by Peta at the last moment. To Peta and his coworker Shaney, a 
Crow
 woman, Lewis shamefully recounts an incident in his adolescence, where Lewis, Ricky, and their friends Gabe and Cass pursued a herd of elk into the elders' section of the reservation, where they were not legally or traditionally allowed to hunt, and shot many unsuspecting elk. Lewis is disturbed that one of the shot elk, a young female, has not died, and shoots her several more times before discovering that she is pregnant. After burying the fetus, he commits to using every portion of the mother elk and giving her meat away to the elders, but the four are stopped at their truck by the game warden and forced to dispose of the elk.

Lewis and Peta's dog is found hanged by its rope in an apparent accident, still alive. They try to nurse the dog back to health, but finds the dog brutally stomped to death one morning with a pair of boots kept in their garage. Plagued by paranoia that the elk from his adolescence has returned for revenge, Lewis becomes suspicious of Shaney's behavior, and is convinced she is the embodiment of the elk spirit. He invites her over and engineers an accident with his motorcycle that brutally kills her. When Peta returns home, Lewis startles her while she is working on the ceiling fan light, causing her to fall and fatally hit her head. He pulls both women's teeth to look for ivory as proof that they are elk, and noticing that Peta appears to be pregnant, cuts an elk calf out of her body. With the calf, he flees towards the reservation, before being shot to death in the ensuing manhunt. The elk spirit, Po'noka, is revealed to be real, and seeking to kill all of the friends to avenge her herd and calf. She is rapidly growing into a human woman's appearance, and hitchhikes back to the reservation.

Cass and Gabe, who still live on the reservation, are preparing for a 
sweat lodge
 ceremony hosted by Cass. Gabe, now an alcoholic absentee father, stops to see his daughter Denorah before her basketball game later that day. They make a bet over Denorah's free throws, which she wins. Cass and Gabe begin the sweat with Nathan Yellow Tail, the son of local cop Victor Yellow Tail. While they are in the sweat lodge, Victor is attacked by the elk spirit. Gabe leaves the lodge to pee and finds Cass' dogs badly bludgeoned; he mercy-kills the final dog with a rock, and decides not to tell Cass during the sweat. He returns to the sweat lodge with an old thermos he finds for a water scoop, which Cass recognizes as the hiding place where he keeps his money and an engagement ring he bought for his girlfriend Jo. Believing that Gabe stole the money and ring, and finding his dogs dead outside, Cass starts a fight with Gabe. Gabe rocks Cass' fixer-upper truck off its cinderblocks, unaware that Cass' girlfriend Jo is hiding underneath, crushing and killing her. Cass attempts to shoot Gabe, but instead hits what appears to be Denorah, and in his guilt allows Gabe to beat him to death. Gabe discovers that Cass had actually shot Nathan, and they are approached by the elk spirit, who agrees to spare Denorah if Gabe kills himself. However, once Gabe does so, she acknowledges that she plans to kill Denorah regardless, as Denorah is Gabe's calf.

Denorah arrives to collect her winnings from the bet, and meets the elk headed woman disguised as Shaney. The elk spirit tells Denorah the men are out on the horses, and challenges her to an intense game of basketball. Eventually the elk spirit is unable to hide her nature anymore due to her injuries, and transforms into an elk-headed figure with the body of a woman, beginning a long pursuit of Denorah through the snowy reservation. Denorah encounters Nathan, wounded on one of the horses, and sends him back to town to alert her stepfather. At the end of her endurance, Denorah stumbles into the site of the elk massacre from her father's youth. The elk headed woman catches up to her but becomes preoccupied with the site where Lewis buried her calf fetus, and from the ground births a living calf. Denorah's stepfather, Denny, the same game warden that interrupted her father's hunt, arrives to save her, but Denorah stops him from killing the elk headed woman and her calf, ending the cycle. The elk spirit sheds her humanity, and retreats into the wilderness as an elk again with her calf."

The story takes place in 2048, 51 years after scientists at 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
 develop a 
force field
-generating device they term the Bobbler. The Bobbler creates a perfectly spherical, reflective, impenetrable, and persistent shield around or through anything.

The bureaucracy running the Laboratory decide to use the Bobbler as a weapon. Declaring themselves the ""Peace Authority"", they enclose the world's weapons and military bases in bobbles, and occasionally entire cities or governments. A brief war is triggered but ends quickly as the military is cut off from command, their weapons, and each other. It is presumed that the people within the bobbles die due to a lack of air and sunlight, since it is believed that the universe is partitioned by a bobble into two sections (inside and outside the bobble). In this new world, governments are weak where they are permitted at all; the Peace Authority seizes control and becomes a 
worldwide government
. In an effort to retain their monopoly on the Bobbler, the Peace Authority makes technological progress illegal and returns the planet to a level similar to that of the 19th century.

The story opens with the crew of a military spaceplane emerging from their bobble and being picked up by a group of Tinkers. The Tinkers are a rebel group who have continued to secretly develop technology to a point well beyond what the Authority allows. Their emergence reveals two previously unknown facts about bobbles: one is that they are not force fields, but rather 
stasis fields
 inside which no time elapses, and the second is that they do not last forever, but will eventually ""pop"" at a time that is not initially determinable by the operators of the Bobbler. The bobble around the spaceplane is the first one known to pop; it is eventually found that the first bobbles last roughly fifty years.

One of the original inventors of the bobble helped form the Tinkers. He develops a more advanced version of the bobbler which can produce bobbles of any size, unlike the Authority's original which is at least house-sized and requires a huge amount of power to run. They also find that they can set the duration of a bobble. Using their new device, they learn that one cannot form a bobble around another. This provides a defence; one can carry a small bobble (in a pocket, for instance), making it impossible for the Peace Authority to bobble that person. With the help of a young thief and mathematical genius, they lead a rebellion to try to bobble the power generators of the Peace Authority and thus neutralize its primary weapon."

In the Raven Tower universe, many 
gods
 of varying levels of power exist. Gods may take the physical forms of animals or landmarks. Gods always speak the truth. If a god says something that is false at the time, the god must expend its energy changing the world so that the statement becomes true. A god may expend all of its energy and die doing this.

The story is narrated by The Strength and Patience of the Hill, a god who inhabits a large boulder. Strength and Patience also discusses its long life, from prehistoric times through the arrival of humans. The country of Iraden is protected by various gods, including the Raven, a god that inhabits a living raven. The capital of Iraden is the 
port
 city of Vastai. It is ruled by the Raven’s Lease, a human who is granted vast power in exchange for committing suicide when the Raven’s possessed bird dies. This act of 
human sacrifice
 provides vast power to the incubating egg from which the next raven will hatch, and be inhabited by the Raven god.

Mawat, son of the Lease and commander of Iraden’s army, receives a message that his father is ill. Mawat is accompanied by his retainer, a 
transgender man
 named Eolo. When they arrive in Vastai, Mawat’s father has disappeared, the raven is dead, and his uncle Hibal is the new Lease. Mawat publicly accuses Hibal of foul play, of threatening Vastai’s stability, and of disrupting trade relationships with other territories. In particular, members of the Xulhan Empire and their snake god are seeking a new alliance with Hibal.

The Strength and Patience of the Hill describes how the Raven once said, ""The gods of Vastai will destroy the gods of Ard Vusktia,"" the city visible just across a strait to the north. Over many years the Raven expended his power to make this true. The war's effects spread far enough to cause the death of the High Priest and worshipers of Strength and Patience. Strength and Patience moved south to Ard Vusktia to help in its defense, but was careful to disguise its true nature. The war ended with the destruction of all of the gods in both countries except the Raven and Strength and Patience.

Eolo discovers that Mawat’s father is being held prisoner in the dungeons of the Raven Tower. He also discovers that Strength and Patience has been used by the Raven to supply the power needed to fulfill the Raven's promises to protect Vastai. In the many years since the end of the war, the Raven’s power has secretly been weakening.

Mawat, believing he is serving the Raven, inadvertently frees Strength and Patience from the mechanism the Raven had used to extract its power. The continued existence of Strength and Patience, an Ard Vusktian god, in contradiction of the statement the Raven made, slowly drained the Raven of power. It is revealed that the Raven ceased to exist just before the story begins.

Mawat is then framed for murdering a high-ranking politician. A flood causes a dysentery outbreak, and a hostile army is advancing through Iraden, revealing that the Raven is no longer able to protect Vastai. Mawat kills Hibal, thinking this human sacrifice will strengthen the Raven; however, since the Raven is dead, it instead gives power to Strength and Patience. Mawat is then killed by the snake god. Strength and Patience says, ""I will kill the Snake god, protect Eolo, and leave Vastai to its fate.""

As the story ends, an armada, coming from the far north, bent on destroying Vastai, is just coming into sight on the far horizon."

This story alternates between the point of view of Terpsichore Melpomene Murray (""Teri""), an ecoprospector who's approaching adulthood on Mars and seeks to follow in her father's footsteps, and the unnamed 
psychiatrist
 who is listening to her story.  Several decades earlier, refugees from 
Earth
 fled to join a pre-existing human colony on Mars to escape the domination of 
One True
, a massively parallel/cellular automata program that runs on the interconnected brains of most of the human beings on Earth; the program in the individual human brain is called Resuna, probably a contraction from the Latin for One Thing.  If a human mind has a copy of Resuna, it may remain dormant until a human speaks the trigger phrase  
let overwrite, let override.


The first half of the novel is mostly backstory in Teri's voice, leading up to the day when she passed her test for  ""full adulthood"", a legal status that can apparently be reached at any age by passing an educational and psychiatric exam, which gives her the right to marry, hold property, vote, and so forth.  Teri hopes to be an ecospector (eco-prospector) like her father Telemachus, living on the surface in a pressure suit most of the time; but because in the last generation  the colonists decided to forgo 
terraforming
 Mars to suit human life and instead adapt humans to suit the Martian environment, the future of ecospecting doesn't look good to Telemachus; he thinks the future of Mars is with the ""Nations"" of Mars-formed humans.  It's estimated that modifying people  can be done in just two to three 
generations
, whereas terraforming Mars might take thousands of years.  Thus he wants her to get an advanced degree and go into some always-needed occupation like science or medicine.

When they strike a ""scorehole"", a very large deposit of methane and water, their fortune seems assured, and Teri expects to marry the boy she has been courting; when it turns out he has married someone else, she grumpily agrees to one more year of school at least, and she and Telemachus take on the job of shepherding a group of younger children to the school at Red Sands City.  While the party are in the roundings (the frontier, bush, or outback—possibly from ""surroundings"" or ""roundabouts""?)  a major 
solar flare
 occurs, and because Mars' thin atmosphere and weak magnetic field provide less protection against high-energy particles than on Earth, this event overloads many electronics systems on Mars, as well as damaging the ""exosuit"" (
space suit
) systems of many people who are outdoors and otherwise unprotected, so that several members of the party are killed, including Telemachus. Furthermore, the GPS-like navigation system Teri has used all her life is permanently down.

Teri and Alik, a boy in the party, re-invent celestial navigation and reach the nearest railhead, where there is a working phone, only to find that the disaster is  planetwide and help will not be coming soon.  Worse yet, a group of Marsform humans are stranded farther up the track and in danger of starving due to their ultrafast metabolisms.  Despite her bigotry against the Nations, Teri tries to take food to them in a backpack, but collapses and breaks her leg.  A mysterious voice on her suit radio soothes and comforts her, takes over her body, and causes her to wreck her body getting food to the Marsforms; she has been taken over by Resuna.  We now learn why the psychiatrist himself has been listening to her story; they are recording it so she can have some idea of what happened in the big gaps he is going to create in her memory while erasing Resuna.  He himself has had this process twice.

Further, we learn that this is all information from the past, that in fact he has been re-infected with Resuna, and so has Teri, and that they will both lose all memory of each other and of the many events, including much of her last memories of her father.  So although they have been close friends, in the last chapter they are re-introduced to each other for the first time.   The novel ends with their working as ecospecting partners, as Mars rebuilds."

Tesla Crane is a wealthy heiress and retired robotics engineer. She suffers from chronic pain and PTSD after a robotics accident that killed six crewmates; she walks with a cane and has a service dog named Gimlet. She and her spouse Shal travel on a cruise to Mars for their honeymoon.

Shal finds a woman named George Saikawa stabbed in the chest outside their cabin. Interested parties include Halden Kuznetsova, the ship’s owner; Dr. Fish, the ship’s physician and Kuznetsova’s estranged college roommate; and Niles Silver, a magician. Shal is arrested for Saikawa’s murder. Shal’s fingerprints are on the murder weapon, and an eyewitness identifies him as the killer. Shal, a retired private investigator, had previously spied on Kuznetsova and Saikawa as part of a case. Tesla knows he is innocent and vows to investigate.

A body is discovered in the ship’s mass recycler, but all passengers and crew are accounted for. Shal is hospitalized after a suspected overdose. Tesla finds that their gin has been spiked with opiates. Later, robots are stolen from both Tesla and Kuznetsova.

Dr. Fish falls from a balcony and leaves a suicide note confessing to killing Saikawa, but evidence indicates she was pushed and was dead before she hit the ground. Kuznetsova is stabbed by an unseen assailant, but survives. Niles Silver is killed during his own magic show.

The chief security officer brings all of the suspects together for an interrogation. Tesla’s stolen robot shoots at the group, aiming for Shal but killing a bartender instead. Tesla finds that Kuznetsova was piloting the robot from a nearby bathroom. He is actually an imposter; the real Kuznetsova is the dead body inside the recycler. The imposter is a distant cousin, Max Astaire, who planned to steal Kuznetsova’s identity and start a new life on Mars. He planned to kill all the people on the ship who could reveal the deception. He and Niles Silver were in league before Astaire killed Silver.

Astaire is arrested. Tesla and Shal celebrate their honeymoon on the remainder of the voyage."

Unlike 
The Book of the New Sun
, 
The Urth of the New Sun
 mostly takes place outside Urth. The book is a continuation of Severian's narration of the aftermath of his ascent to the throne and subsequent journey ""between the suns"" to be judged and win back the fountain of life that will rejuvenate the slowly dying sun and revive life on Urth. When the book begins, Severian has already rewritten his accounts of before and is beginning his new log aboard the spaceship that will take him to Yesod, an enigmatic planet, home to the godlike beings who have the power to revitalize Urth and its sun.

Aboard the ship, Severian meets Zak, a mysterious being, who begins small and soon develops human form and turns out to be the all-powerful 
Tzadkiel
 of 
Yesod
. Once in Yesod, Severian faces an immense task of facing all the deceased people he has encountered since his childhood, including Thecla and Master Malrubius. When he faces the tribunal to be judged by Tzadkiel, he is told that the trial was already successfully passed. Severian is made the New Sun.

After his return to Urth from Yesod, he finds the sun still dying, and that the New Sun is still very far, far away, but nevertheless moving relentlessly. He learns that many years have passed backwards. He also learns that he possesses healing power that he once attributed the Claw of the Conciliator and is taken as a prisoner into the Citadel, where he tells a story to his followers to comfort them. A prisoner in the next cell writes it down as 
The Book of the New Sun
, the holy text of the Church of the Conciliator. He encounters the first Autarch Ymar and an earlier version of Typhon, who attempts to kill him. He manages to escape via the Corridors of Time. There, with the aid of a version of Tzadkiel, he travels back to the future. In his palace he finds his wife Valeria sitting on the throne attended by his old rival Baldanders (who has grown enough to match the size of an undine). Shortly after Severian reveals himself, an 
apocalyptic flood
 washes away the citadel and much of the land of Urth, thus bringing destruction and rebirth.

Severian travels as far into past as he can and a primitive tribe accepts him as their divine king Apu-Punchau. After teaching and helping them for decades, he finally decides to leave, but is then killed by the tribe in their panic. He wakes inside a tomb and is once again accompanied by the Hierodules Ossipago, Barbatus and Famulimus, as well as the dead body of Apu-Punchau. It is revealed that Severian is an 
eidolon
, a ghost-like being become material, and that he actually died on Tzadkiel's ship.

Once more, Severian flees through the Corridors of Time. Urth, now called 
Ushas
, has recovered from the flood. A priest recognizes Severian as the Sleeper, one of their gods, and then leads him to where the other gods sleep as the novel ends."

The Bezeri are no more.  The effects of the 
cobalt-salted nuclear weapons
 have had devastating effects on their population and has wiped them out completely.  Aras and the rest of the Wess'Har have a strong desire to see those responsible punished.  They have already destroyed the 
Actaeon
 and its crew that refused to abandon ship.  Those who did are now the occupants of the habitat called Umeh Station on the planet Umeh, as it is called by the Isenj who live there.  Aras is battling his conflicting loyalties and genetics.  Part of him wants to blame Bennett for Shan's death as he was involved and another part recognizes that Bennett now shares genes with himself and Shan.  Aras and Bennett take a trip to the transplanted colony from Constantine, now called Mar'an'cas.  Aras feels the need to see the Garrod family and see to the colony's well-being.  He finds, unsurprisingly, that he is no longer welcome.  They admit him as they do not have the force to stop him but they make their feelings clear.

Eddie Michallat is increasingly becoming more involved in the politics of the different worlds interacting.  He is friends with the Isenj Minister Ual; who is finding that as he fights to preserve his world from the potential wrath of Eqbas Vorhi, so Umeh seems intent on its own destruction.  He is inescapably bound to Wess'ej as tries to honor the memory of Shan Frankland and her sacrifices for everyone involved and his growing friendship with Aras, Bennett and the Wess'Har community.  He still is a reporter at heart but that seems to be changing as his conscience affects his decisions for stories more and more.  The information he provides now has the power to create war on Earth and the realization is sobering.  Eddie decides to tell the real reasons for the destruction of Christopher, the death of Shan Frankland and also of the coming of the World Before and its possible ramifications, to the people of Earth.  The Wess'Har have demanded the delivery of Mohan Rayat and Lindsay Neville.  Minister Ual has been told by his government that they will only do so only if the Destroyer of Mjat (name given to Aras for the destruction of the Isenj city on Bezer'ej) is turned over to them.  Ual, knowing that the Wess'Har do not negotiate, has decided to oppose his government by secretly allying with Eddie and the Royal Marines at Umeh Station to capture Neville and Rayat and turn them over to the Wess'Har.  He knows this will be the end of his career and possibly his life but for the sake of Umeh, he feels he must do this.

The Wess'Har scouts have discovered the body of Shan Frankland.  Nevyan takes a shuttle out to recover her body.  To her surprise and astonishment, they discover, once her body is aboard, that Shan is still alive.  She has been floating, frozen in the depths of space for months and her 
c'naatat
 has somehow kept her dormant but alive.  Her body appears as a 
mummy
; waxy and 
emaciated
.  They return to F'nar and reveal this to Bennett, Aras, Eddie, and the rest of the F'nar community.  They immediately set about taking care of her to nurse her back to health.  She does eventually recover enough to wake up.

Meanwhile, the World Before has come.  A patrol ship lands and disgorges a crew of only males.  They are the first ship and advise that another will be along as well.  The Wess'Har do what they can to be accommodating but Nevyan does not like the way the Eqbas males seem interested in 
c'naatat
.  Eventually the second ship from Eqbas Vorhi arrives and it is massive.  The ship itself rearranges and two smaller ships split off from it; one to reconnoiter Bezer'ej and the other for Umeh.  The tension on Umeh heightens with this and the Isenj try to make the Wess'Har withdraw but to no avail.

Shan is filling out and getting stronger thanks to the care of Ade and Aras.  She finds that she has feelings for both men and Aras, whose people practice 
polyandry
, finds this acceptable and would like a house brother but fears that Shan will come to prefer Ade because of their shared homeworld.  Ade is having a harder time contemplating a polyandric relationship but is coping as best he can.  As Shan gets stronger she begins getting involved in the politics and the goings-on of F'nar.  She also makes a trip to Bezer'ej to view the destruction and what the Eqbas are doing to repair the damage.  While there, they discover that the blast did not destroy the 
c'naatat
 and that there are some survivors of Bezeri.  The Bezeri only want to talk to Aras, though.  When Aras journeys to the world, the Bezeri tell him that they want those responsible turned over to them for ""balancing"".  Aras knows that the Bezeri would include the Royal Marines in their list of those responsible, so to protect Ade, Aras lies and says that it was just Neville and Rayat.  The Bezeri also want Aras to come stay with them underwater to help them rebuild and recover what they've lost.  Aras is torn by his duty to the Bezeri and his duty to stay with Shan and make her happy.

The Eqbas are moving right into their roles as peacekeepers and environmental control.  They advise both Earth and Umeh to prepare for their coming and the changes that will entail.  In the instance of Umeh, population control and environmental cleansing—and in the case of Earth, they plan to restore the plants and animals held in the 
gene bank
; whether Earth likes it or not.  They are also cleaning up the damage on Bezer'ej in record time.  On Wess'Har, one Eqbas named Shapakti, is performing miracles.  He has found a way to separate 
c'naatat
 from its human host, using sample tissue from Shan, but not from its wess'har host.  He also started creating a 
jungle
 
habitat
 using DNA and 
genomes
 from the gene bank.

Aras decides that he will go live with the Bezeri in spite of the pain it will cause him to be separated from Shan.  Ade wants Shan to be happy and feels that he is in the way of Shan's and Aras' happiness so he decides to force Aras not to go.  The solution presents itself in the form of Mohan Rayat and Lindsey Neville.  Lindsey wants to redeem herself (and not die) and feels that the best way to accomplish this is to live underwater and serve the Bezeri.  This would mean becoming infected with 
c'naatat
.  Ade agrees to this and infects both her and Rayat and send them to the depths with the Bezeri.  Shan knows nothing of all this at this point and seems to finally accept her role as an 
isan
 to Ade and Aras in their polyandric relationship."

The story alternates between the past and the present; this plot summary is written in chronological order.

In the world of the story, demons come from the underearth. The nomadic people of the Saredi make a deal to allow demons into the overearth; the demons possess the bodies of recently deceased Saredi, becoming members of their extended families. Witches are born of the unions between mortals and demons.



The Past
[

]


Kai-Enna is a demon living among the Kentdessa Saredi clan. His cousin Adeni is killed by a monster, presaging an invasion by the Hierarchs. The Hierarchs's expositors, or magicians, close the gateway to the underearth and separate the demons from their home. The Hierarchs ally with the Immortal Blessed in order to capture and control most of the continent. They take prisoners of war, including Kai, to their Summer Halls.

Kai is rescued by Bashasa Calis, a prisoner of war and prince-heir of the city-state Benais-arik. Bashasa leads a rebellion. He is assisted by the witch Ziede; the Immortal Blessed warrior Tahren, who has chosen to turn against her people and the Hierarchs; and Tahren's brother Dahin. These fighters free the prisoners and kill a Hierarch in the first successful retaliation against the conquest. During this process, Kai steals the body of an expositor. This non-consensual possession is a great wrongdoing in the eyes of the other demons, including his cousin Arn-Nefa; the other demons disown him. Bashasa reclaims his throne in Benais-arik, leading to the founding of the Rising World coalition.



The Present
[

Kai wakes to find that he has been imprisoned. An expositor attempts to bind him as a familiar, but Kai kills him. During this process, Kai's consciousness jumps into a new body. He rescues his companion Ziede and a street urchin named Sanja. Ziede's wife Tahren remains missing. Kai suspects that Bashat bar Calis, current prince-heir of Benais-arik, is responsible.

They are pursued by expositors who are using a ship stolen from Immortal Blessed. Ramad, personal vanguard to Prince-heir Bashat, helps Kai. The prince of Nient-arik is implicated. This city-state wants to replace Benais-arik as the leaders of the Rising World Coalition during the upcoming treaty renewal ceremony.

They travel to the ruins of the Hierarchs’ Summer Halls to look for a finding stone, which will help them locate Tahren. At the Halls, they fine Dahin. They are attacked by Arn-Sterath (formerly Arn-Nefa), who is working with Immortal Blessed and the Nient-arik conspirators. Kai and Ziede emerge victorious with the finding stone.

It is revealed that Bashat knew about the Immortal Blessed and Nient-arik conspiracy. He knew their plot to capture Kai would fail, so poisoned Kai allowing Kai, Ziede, and Tahren to be captured. He then exposed the plot in order to strengthen his own city's position. Ramad has been his spy. Kai has simultaneously organized to weaken the international support of Benais-arik, causing the renewal to fail and the Rising World coalition to devolve into a set of allied states rather than an empire. Kai abandons Ramad. They use the finding stone to locate Tahren, imprisoned by Immortal Blessed. The remaining conspirators are captured and Ziede is reunited with her wife."

The protagonist is a survivalist named Chaos, who lives in an abandoned 
megaplex
 in 
Wyoming
 after an apparent 
nuclear strike
. The residents of his town of Hatfork are reliant on a sinister 
messianic
 figure named Kellogg for food. Kellogg also has powerful 
dreams
, which he transfers into the minds of others. Chaos's mind is especially receptive, making him reluctant to sleep.

Both Lethem and Chaos abandon this premise early on, and Chaos also goes by the name of ""Everett Moon"", depending on where he is. The novel plays with several other 
dystopian
 and post-apocalyptic setups. One area is covered in a thick green fog, save for an exclusive private school. 
Vacaville, California
, has converted to a 
luck
-based social system, taken to 
totalitarian
 extremes.

Amnesia Moon
 bears homage to 
Philip K. Dick
. During a party scene, one guest describes a battle of wills in 
West Marin
, and another cites a West Marin inhabitant named ""Hoppington"", both references to Dick's 
Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb
. Vacaville is reminiscent of Dick's 
Solar Lottery
, where society is also based on chance. When Moon and Melinda reach 
San Francisco
, 
hallucinogenic
 drugs play a role in altered perceptions that provide access to other characters in this world, as in 
The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch
. Elsewhere, it is argued that the depicted realities splintered away from each other to provide resistance to a hive-like 
alien invasion
 of Earth. Such 
solipsistic
 worlds are reminiscent of Dick's early novel 
Eye in the Sky
.

The one constant throughout is the idea that reality is shaped by powerful and 
charismatic
 ""dreamers"". The reason for the break in realities, and Chaos/Moon's place in this world, is a unifying mystery."

The novel centers on 
Glawen Clattuc
, an intelligent, capable young man. Glawen's father Scharde foils an attempt by an old family enemy, Spanchetta Clattuc, to falsely inflate Glawen's ""index number"" and thereby reduce his chances of achieving Agency status. He joins 
Bureau B
, the department responsible for enforcing the laws of the Charter.

Glawen becomes romantically involved with the beautiful Sessily Veder. When Sessily disappears, an investigation suggests she was raped and murdered, her body shipped off-planet in a wine cask. However, there is insufficient evidence to convict the primary suspect, Spanchetta's son Arles.

Later, Glawen becomes acquainted with and attracted to 
Wayness Tamm
, the daughter of the new Conservator.  Glawen saves Wayness from a rape attempt by Arles. Then, after the murder of her brother (engineered by a Yip), Wayness reveals to Glawen that while she was visiting 
Earth
, her father's cousin became the secretary of the nearly moribund Naturalist Society and discovered that the Charter was missing (a previous secretary had been a thief and sold the society's assets). Whoever possesses it is the legal owner of Cadwal. She decides to return alone to Earth to search for it.

Glawen is ordered by Bureau B chief Bodwyn Wook to join the Bold Lions (a boisterous drinking club for devil-may-care youths) and travel to Yipton with them on an annual jaunt, using the opportunity to spy on the Yips. He is accompanied by Kirdy Wook, a Bold Lion and also a Bureau B agent. Glawen discovers that the Yips are secretly assembling a flyer (a flying vehicle), most likely to further their goal of seizing Deucas. However, Glawen is spotted. He gets away, but Kirdy is caught and tortured by the Yips. With great difficulty, Bodwyn Wook secures his release. Although Kirdy recovers physically, his mind is severely affected, and Glawen senses that Kirdy nurtures an intense irrational hatred for him.

Glawen travels to a small island for a holiday. To his horror, he discovers that ""parties"" are being held there in which rich off-worlders are allowed to have their way with young Yip girls, who are then killed. An outraged Bodwyn Wook has them arrested, but is persuaded to allow the wealthy prisoners to pay very large fines instead of being executed in order to pay for desperately needed flyers and weapons to counter the Yip threat.

He sends Glawen off-world to discover the identity of the organizers and, to Glawen's disquiet, orders that Kirdy accompany him. Kirdy eventually betrays Glawen, who is imprisoned by a sect which believes in total equality of the sexes. Their extreme stance has led to a declining population. Their leader informs Glawen that he is to be a sex slave to remedy the situation. It turns out some of the sect members had participated in the ""parties"" in a prior attempt to solve their dilemma.  After six months, Glawen manages to escape and shut down the sect.

He then returns to Cadwal and finally identifies Sessily's murderer: Kirdy Wook. Kirdy had been jealous of Glawen from childhood. Kirdy attempts to kill Glawen on a beach, but Glawen lures him out into the water; a weak swimmer, Kirdy is dragged out to sea by the 
undertow
 and drowns.

Glawen has also uncovered the organizer of the sex parties. Floreste is an dramatist who will go to any lengths to fund his dream: the construction of a magnificent new Orpheum. Condemned to death, Floreste refuses to divulge any information until Glawen threatens to sue and seize his hard-won funds as damages. Glawen's father Scharde, a senior Bureau B agent, is missing and presumed dead in an accident while on patrol, but Floreste confirms that he is actually a prisoner. He also inadvertently gives Glawen startling news as to who is really leading the Yips."

Birthright
 spans a timeline of nearly 17 millennia, beginning at a very early stage of expansion from Earth and ending with the death of the last humans. In between, it chronicles a slow but (despite some set-backs) steady conquest of the entire 
galaxy
 - inhabited by thousands of sentient alien races, which are overpowered and oppressed using whatever tool it takes: economic pressure, diplomatic finesse, or simple military power.

Not all chapters deal with humanity's treatment of aliens; some also cover the ""internal"" politics that result in a development of the growing human empire from a democracy to a monarchy. But the biggest theme is undeniably the search for the elusive quality that allows humanity to overcome all opposition and manage the unique feat of conquering the entire galaxy. It is never clearly defined but manifests perhaps most succinctly when it also results in the failure of an attempt to cross the void between galaxies.

Then, after there is no more room for conquest, the only way left is down: internal struggles as well as deep-seated resentment of aliens result in a decline of human power that takes nearly as long as the rise, but is described far less extensively. Somehow, despite whatever enabled humans to achieve total power, they were unable to keep it.

One of the chapters reveals the ""literary genre of fiction"" as another of humanity's peculiarities, not shared by any alien race."

The book is divided into two parts, the ""home"", and the ""castle"". The ending is part of the ""home"" section, returning after the castle.

The story is based around the German fairy tale of 
Briar Rose
 (
Sleeping Beauty
) which is told by ""Gemma"", an elderly woman, to her three granddaughters. She tells this to the children almost all the time and it is the only bedtime story she ever tells. The times when ""Gemma"" tells the story are flashbacks and alternate between the present-day story.



""Home""
[
edit
]


In the present day, Gemma's 
Jewish
 family is living somewhere outside a city in 
Massachusetts
. After her grandmother's death, Rebecca Berlin, the youngest of her three granddaughters (referred to as Becca in the novel) begins to believe that there is some meaning behind the bedtime story that her grandmother told to them hundreds of times. She consults Stan, a good friend and journalist who works for an ""alternative"" newspaper and uncovers historical facts.

She discovers that her grandmother was actually a survivor of the 
Holocaust
 who was persecuted for her Jewish origins, and sent to 
Chełmno extermination camp
 to be executed. She decides to visit Chełmno and discovers a link with a man by the name of Josef Potocki in Poland. Becca sets off for Poland to find the identity and the life of her grandmother.



The Castle - Josef's story
[
edit
]


In Poland, Josef tells his life story and his meeting with Gemma. In the book, his story is told in the ""castle"" section. He was a target of the 
Holocaust
 due to his homosexuality, and became a fugitive, during which time he met many different people, mainly partisans, mainly in Germany. He had heard stories of torture and extermination camps and joined an underground group set out to rescue victims. This leads him to Chełmno (called 
Kulmhof
 by the Germans), where he witnesses the gassing to death of numerous people. The people are brought to the camp and then packed into trucks. The trucks drive away, with their exhaust funnelled into the passenger hold. By the time the trucks arrive at their destination, a mass grave, all of the people it was carrying have been gassed to death by the truck exhaust. The people are then dumped into the grave. When the bodies are dumped one of the partisans, named The Avenger notices that a woman with red hair (Gemma) is still alive and faintly breathing. Josef revives her through mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, which the woman, (who is later called KSIĘŻNICZKA, which means 'princess' in Polish) refers to in her fairy tale as ""the kiss of life"". In reality, during this period of time, 320,000 were killed in Chelmno via the method of gassing them in trucks.

Later, she hid in the forest with Polish partisans, fighting the Nazis, and married The Avenger, whom Josef was also in love with. She became pregnant by him shortly after their marriage. Then he, along with almost all of the other partisans, was killed by the Nazis. She escaped and was brought safely to the United States. She never told a soul about these experiences, rather dealing with the trauma by refashioning them in her mind into the form of a familiar fairytale about an evil witch, a princess rendered unconscious who is then revived by a handsome prince, and a happy ending.

The novel begins with Chase Insteadman, a former child actor whose career seems to be over, accidentally meeting Perkus Tooth, a once-promising critic now barely surviving by writing liner notes for CDs and DVDs at the office space of 
The Criterion Collection
, and Perkus is eager to expose Chase to a self-contained universe of pop culture esoterica. Perkus has unconventional opinions on almost everything, especially 
Marlon Brando
, and is glad to express them; Chase contents himself with listening to his new friend. Much of the first part of the novel is pivoted upon Perkus' speeches and Chase's thoughts about them. In this part of the novel readers also meet Perkus' friends: Oona Laszlo, a ghost-writer of autobiographies, and presently that of high-profile sculptor Laird Noteless, whose ""dystopian"" public art exhibits are hinted to actually be disaster sites; Richard Abneg, a former squatter, now working for the powerful NYC mayor, Jules Arnheim (who seems to be a fictional portrait of 
Michael Bloomberg
); Biller, a black hobo who unexpectedly turns Internet wizard; and Georgina Hawkmanaji, often referred to as the ostrich-woman, a 
Turk
 heiress to ""twenty million or so of inherited 
Armenian plunder
.""

Strange things happen in the NYC depicted in the novel; a mysterious tiger randomly destroys buildings and underground stations; a grey fog envelops Manhattan's Downtown; people are fascinated by mysterious chaldrons, gorgeous vases that are only seen in pictures, because nobody seems to have ever seen the originals; people keep asking Chase about his fiancée, Janice Trumbull, stranded on the orbital space station, even though he cannot remember anything of the woman but her letters. On the other hand, nothing really important seems to happen in the plot, with the characters living their ordinary lives, unconventional as they may be. But then the tiger strikes Perkus' favorite hamburger joint, and damages the building he lives in; this suddenly turns him into a hobo, and sets in motion a chain of events which will bring the novel to its conclusion—and to several final revelations."

The novel opens in the year 2198 and shows several preliminary scenes both on Earth and on alien planets; however, most of the action takes place much later, in the year 2374, on planet Cavanagh's Star.  The planet is far from Earth, but very similar to it in atmosphere; it is claimed already by three alien races when a group of 
gethes
 (alien term for humans, literally 
carrion eater
) arrives to explore, led by former police woman, 
Shan Frankland
.  The Bezeri (squid-like water dwellers) are the planet's natural inhabitants, the Isenj are invaders here to take advantage of unused land, and the Wess'har are the mediators, here to defend the Bezeri from Isenj pollution.  Also coexisting on the planet is Constantine - a Christian colony of humans (led by Josh Garrod) who landed on the planet several generations ago in an attempt to escape the corruption of Earth.  Constantine is guided by the Wess'har, Aras, who is plagued with a strange disease which outcasts him from Wess'har society.  The political balance is tenuous, and Shan must play the mediator between her anxious, disobedient crew and the powerful military force of these alien beings.  At the same time, she is troubled by her own past and the strange relationship that seems to be forming between her and Aras, as she struggles to lead a mission whose goal she doesn't yet consciously know.

Troodon
 attack and cannibalism, she manages to bear two pups. They witness the 
Chicxulub impact
, although one of the pups is cooked alive and her mate succumbs to 
hypothermia
. Purga and her surviving pup eventually arrive at a shore, where other 
Purgatorius
 are feeding on a dying

monoculture
 means that the villagers' diet and health are poorer than those of hunter-gatherers. When tribute-collector Keram arrives, Juna learns about the city of 
Cata Huuk

 skull that he invites the entire group to a museum in Rome, where they misidentify a 
Protoceratops
 as a 
griffin
. Honorius is confident that the remains prove that living beings were radically different in the past. Away on a cave expedition, Athalaric asks Honorius to become a priest on his father's request, to lead Rome away from decay. Honorius however is not interested and is murdered by the henchmen of Athalaric's father. His remains are buried next to Old Man's.

Joan Useb

In the epilogue, set in 2049, a 52-year-old Joan and her 18-year-old daughter Lucy rescue 
feral children
 left behind in the 
Galápagos Islands
 due to the ensuing wars and toxic rain. Reflecting on humanity's bleak future, Lucy asks Joan whether she has been happy and she responds affirmatively, based on the fact that unlike their ancestors, they have a glimpse into the past and can be certain that some form of life will survive into the far future.

Centuries later, officers Snowy, Ahmed, Sidewise, Bonner and Moon awaken and soon realize that human civilization has long collapsed. Ahmed, the leader, attempts to rebuild civilization, but with Moon being the only female, crops being long extinct and not knowing how to recreate even the most basic technology, Sidewise and Bonner agree that Ahmed's plan is completely unrealistic. A month later, Snowy discovers that there actually are humans, now feral and without language. Internal conflicts distance Sidewise and Bonner, Moon disappears, Ahmed succumbs to 
mercury poisoning
 from fish, and Snowy chooses to spend the rest of his life following the feral people. As Snowy arrives to the coast of 
Sussex
, he reflects on how everything humans ever made has vanished.

Remembrance
 (30 My from now, Western Africa). A monkey-like post-human female. The descendants of 
feral children
 have diversified into many non-sapient species, from everything resembling arboreal primates (Remembrance's kind), 
eusocial
 moles, and elephants, the latter being ""farmed"" by rodents. They inhabit a lush forest, still having some artificial remains like bits of glass, 
bitumen
 and copper. Avoiding rodent and avian predators, Remembrance falls into a mole-folk pit, where she survives for several days. She eventually returns to the canopy, but soon the impact of 
Eros
 unleashes a 
mass extinction
.

Ultimate

capuchin-like
 post-human female inhabiting the deserts of 
Pangaea Ultima
. Her species is closely symbiotic with 
borametz trees
, which grow pods to sleep and nurse their young. Due to the harsh climate, the tree begins consuming Ultimate's child, and she takes her to the desert, accompanied with her friend, Cactus. They encounter descendants of beetles, rats, lizards and toads, and Cactus is hunted by a huge, transparent salamander. A few days later, Ultimate arrives to the shores of a drying inland sea, where she finds the hardened footprints of one of her kind, both of them being the last ""human"" explorers. After returning and giving her child to the tree, Ultimate becomes the last primate to reproduce, and soon her herd and tree die. In the following eons Earth is consumed by the Sun, but hibernating bacteria are hurled into space and end up on the seas of a habitable 
exoplanet
, starting evolution again.



Protagonists outside the Purga–human line

Characters listed below are not ancestral to or descend from humans, although some are primates and thus descend from Purga.

Listener

Pangaea
). A female 
Ornitholestes
 living with Stego, her mate. Unlike most animals in the book, they are fully 
sapient
, with complex language, leather belts, whips, and a culture that revolves around 
Diplodocus
 hunting. Stego is killed by an 
Allosaurus
 during a hunt, and Listener swears to kill the 
Diplodocus
 matriarch that indirectly caused his death. Ten years later, she and her three sons manage to hunt the matriarch, which dooms the herd as well as the 
Ornitholestes
 settlement. They become extinct and humans never discover that another sapient species preceded them.

Roamer
 (32 Mya, North Africa). A female of a capuchin-like primate species unknown to paleontology. After a flood destroys her home, she finds herself and other members of her species on a haphazard raft on the Atlantic. Starvation and thirst nearly kill them, but Roamer and two other survivors eventually land on the rainforests of 
Yucatán
 and their descendants give rise to a new line of monkeys.

Dig
 (10 Mya, 
Antarctica
). A female of a 
lemming-like
 primate species. The Antarctica she inhabits still has forests inhabited by the descendants of 
Velociraptor
, 
Allosaurus
 and 
Muttaburrasaurus
. Though more temperate than today, the Antarctic forests are becoming progressively colder and more inhospitable. Ice caps completely bury the remains of Dig's ecosystem and humans never discover that non-avian dinosaurs survived 55 million years longer than previously thought.

Although its original purpose is to construct bases for human habitation, it stops receiving orders due to the chaos unleashed by Rabaul's eruption on Earth and continues replicating itself unhindered. Within a few centuries, Johnnie's descendants have consumed the planet entirely and leave the Solar System. As the self-replication process is imperfect, they begin undergoing a process akin to biological evolution. About 500 million years later, a self-aware probe arrives on Earth to investigate the origins of its kind. Although it encounters evidence of past intelligent activity, and even Ultimate —its creators' descendant— it considers its mission a failure and leaves."

Fire Time
 takes place on the planet Ishtar in the ""Anubelea"" system, located 300 
parsecs
 away from the Sun. Ishtar's peculiar orbit around the three stars of the Anubelea system (Bel, Ea, and Anu) results in the ""Fire Time"", a dramatic increase in heat every thousand years as the ""demon star"" Anu approaches the planet. As the northern hemisphere heats up, large numbers of Ishtarians flee south, leading to a collapse of civilization. The northern natives (Valennen) take advantage of the Gathering's (southern natives) culture to win two victories in Valennen territory.  The presence of visitors from Earth (also engaged in their own war off-planet at Nasqua) raises the prospect of changing the dynamics of history, though, with Earth involved in an interstellar war of its own, human aid is not guaranteed.

The book begins with a brief history of the Lands of Vin. It is narrated by a Washer, or preacher, of the Collegium, the main religious body. Nearly fifteen hundred years before the events that take place in Flesh and Fire, the Lands of Vin were ruled by arrogant prince-mages, who derived their power from spellwine. To put an end to the prince-mages' tyranny, Zatim, a demigod more commonly referred to as ""Sin Washer"", drastically reduced the 
magic
 contained in the spellgrapes used to make spellwine.

The prelude of the book describes a mutant grub infestation Master Vinart Sionio of Iaja discovers in his vineyards. The mutation is caused by magic, and could only have been created by another Vineart. The plot then comes to Jerzy, an adolescent slave owned by Master Vineart Malech of The Berengia. When Jerzy in entranced by the smell of crushed grapes during the harvest, Malech takes interest in Jerzy. Malech then tests Jerzy's ability to sense magic, and begins training Jerzy to become a Vineart.

During this time, the first of a series of strange events occur. First, an unusually large order of healwines is placed by the island kingdom of Atakus. Meanwhile, in Atakus, Prince Erebuh has just received a negotiator from a Vineart on the nearby island of Ekai concerning the loss of three ships carrying spellwine. This is highly unusual, as Atakus, a key port for ships, makes extensive use of spellwines to ensure fair weather. After Prince Erebuh gives the negotiator his reply, the prince's most trusted daughter, Thais, visits the negotiator, who kills her then commits suicide. Upon further investigation by Atakus's Master Vineart, Edon, it is discovered that the negotiator's actions were not his own, but under the influence of spellwine.

Malech continues teaching Jerzy the process in crafting spellwines. A few months into Jerzy's training, Malech's primary field becomes infested with rootglow, though it is out of season for the disease. The infestation is contained, but does significant damage to Malech's vines. Then a wagon sent to collect healwines for a nearby town is destroyed, with no apparent cause. Malech begins to send inquiries to other Vineart, and discovers they have also been seeing an unusual number of accidents.

In Aktakus, Prince Erebuh decides to completely isolate the island in a veil of fog, at the suggestion of Master Vineart Edon.

Cooper Shen, a member of the 
Cooperage
 Guild then brings Malech news of 
sea serpents
 sighted near Atakus, the first sighting in over seven generations. Two weeks later, a messenger from Prince Ranulf arrives, and tells Malech that a sea serpent has destroyed the entire town of Darcen. The messenger also brings a request for spellwines to cleanse the area contaminated by the sea serpent, and Malech sends Jerzy with the messenger to determine which spellwine will be necessary. When Jerzy reaches Prince Ranulf's encampment, the sea serpent resurfaces, but is quickly killed by spells which Prince Ranulf and Jerzy cast. Jerzy returns with pieces of the serpent, and Malech determines that it was created using magic.

Malech then sends Jerzy to study with Vineart Giordan of Aleppan, while secretly instructing Jerzy to find how much of the recent events has taken public interest. Giordan's dependence on the maiar of Aleppan is already under criticism from the Collegium, and when news of the exchange reaches Washers in Upper Altenne, they send Brother Darian to learn more about Jerzy.

Jerzy arrives in Aleppan by boat, and begins his training with Giordan.  Ao, a trader with the Eastern Wind Trading Clan, notices Jerzy's attempts to eavesdrop on the conversations of nobles, and offers to teach Jerzy how to be less conspicuous. Near Atakus, a Caulic ship attempts to locate the island, and determine the cause of its disappearance. The Caulic fleet also intends to capture Atakus's valuable ports.

Jerzy also comes in contact with the maiar's daughter, Mahault, who shares how her father has not been acting normally in the past year. The sentiment is echoed by others who Jerzy meets with access to the court. After Ao and Mahault take interest in Jerzy's attempts to collect information, Jerzy solicits Ao's help in finding useful gossip.

When Jerzy secretly tastes Giordan's grapes to determine if they were used to create the sea serpent, he is spotted by Brother Darian. Darian accuses Jerzy of break the Command, and apostasy, a crime punishable by death. During the trial, Giordan attempts to defer all blame to Jerzy, but the maiar and Darian are intent on finding Giordan guilty. Giordan panics, and attacks the guards. Mahault and Ao use the commotion to free Jerzy and the city."

Fourth Mansions
 was inspired by 
Teresa of Ávila
's 
Interior Castle
, and contains quotations from the book, which Lafferty uses as chapter headings. The Interior Castle is a metaphor for an individual's soul; its different rooms, different states of the soul. In the middle of the Castle the soul is in the purest state, which equals Heaven. Lafferty uses more complex symbols in telling a many-sided tale of an individual's reaching towards Heaven or Truth.
The novel concerns a time of great change, when four forces – in the form of secret societies – contend to control the next phase of humanity's history. In the middle is Fred Foley, an innocent reporter. One of these forces intends to unleash a deadly virus on the US, the others attempt to stop them. A revolution by Mexican migrants, the craft of ""mind weaving"" and a strange group of ""Patricks"", all apparently tramps but with great resources, appear in the center of a narrative.

In the present day, narrated in 
second-person
, Harrowhark Nonagesimus discovers that her ascension to Lyctorhood
[
a
]
 was imperfect. John, Emperor of the Nine Houses, nevertheless fulfils his promise to renew her House, waking several hundred new citizens from cryogenic sleep. He explains the nature of Lyctorhood, which he has obscured from the Houses. John resurrected humanity from cataclysm by impossibly powerful necromancy, inadvertently spawning Resurrection Beasts, the ghosts of the dead planets, that hunt Lyctors. Fellow Lyctor Ianthe Tridentarius gives Harrow a series of instructive sealed letters she seemingly penned to herself, though does not explain why.

In alternating chapters, portrayed in 
third-person
, Harrow recounts events that directly contradict those of 
Gideon the Ninth
. Instead of Gideon, her cavalier is Ortus Nigenad, who is occupied with the epic poem 
The Noniad.
 She reveals to him that she is insane: in both past and present, she is missing large portions of her memory, and she hallucinates ""the Body"", the beautiful woman she saw in the Locked Tomb as a child.

In the past, arriving at Canaan House, Teacher informs the heirs and cavaliers that there is a beast lying in the heart of the facility called “the Sleeper.” Except for Harrow and Ianthe, every character who died in the events of 
Gideon the Ninth
 survives in this account and vice versa.

In the present day, Harrow is taken to the Emperor's space station, the Mithraeum. John reveals he and his Lyctors have been fighting Resurrection Beasts for millennia; most have been lost to madness or battle. The survivors are a vicious and embittered Mercymorn, a flippant Augustine and a stoic, relentless Ortus, who attempts to kill Harrow multiple times, deeming her a threat.

Harrow and Ianthe are taught how to travel to the River, an otherworldly afterlife, which in addition to providing 
faster-than-light
 travel allows them to defeat the Resurrection Beasts by destroying their 
astral bodies
. The Lyctoral process is fundamental to this: the echo of the consumed cavalier's soul controls the physical body to ensure its survival. Both Harrow and Ianthe struggle with this. Harrow helps Ianthe replace her once-severed sword arm with that of its gilded skeleton.

The Lyctors prepare to battle the nearest Beast, killing planets to prevent it feeding. On one such mission, Harrow encounters Camilla Hect, whom she believed dead. She in fact works for ""Blood of Eden,"" a terrorist organization seeking to foil the Empire's 
colonialist
 ambitions, led by the mysterious Commander Wake. She helps Harrow learn that Palamedes (to whom she was cavalier) is not truly dead; his spirit is sequestered in a tiny bubble inside the River.

Harrow learns that the Canaan House of her supposed past is a similar such bubble: those present other than Harrow are the souls of the dead from the real events of 
Gideon the Ninth
. Prior to writing the letters, she requested Ianthe perform brain surgery to obscure her memories of Gideon, ensuring her soul could not truly be absorbed. The spirits make a last-ditch attempt to fight the Sleeper by summoning Matthias Nonius, legendary 
Noniad
 swordsman. They kill the Sleeper, who is unmasked as the ghost of Commander Wake. Marta, Protesilaus and Ortus resolve to follow Matthias into the River to face the Beast alongside ""Ortus"" the First, whose name is in fact Gideon the First. Abigail and Magnus, Fifth House necromancer and cavalier, tell Harrow to return to her life, but she is unable, hallucinating a variety of alternate universes.

It is revealed that the second person perspective was not stylistic but narrated by Gideon Nav, who awakens in Harrow's body. Alongside the remaining Lyctors she makes her way to the Emperor's chambers; he is failing to interrogate Wake, who has possessed the corpse of the Lyctor Cytherea. Surprised by Gideon Nav's presence, Mercymorn and Augustine reveal a long-anticipated plan known as 
dios apate
: using 
semen stolen
 from John, Wake 
artificially inseminated
 herself. The child was intended as a bomb to breach the Locked Tomb, releasing its prisoner: Alecto, John's cavalier, whose ""perfect lyctorhood"" gave him limitless power while preserving her life. The plan failed, and the Emperor's child survived as Gideon herself.

Mercymorn destroys John's body, but he effortlessly returns and kills her, shedding his affable persona and demanding fealty from all Lyctors but the non-present Harrow. Augustine throws the Mithraeum itself into the River, but Ianthe intervenes to save John, dooming Augustine. As they fight to escape, it is revealed that Gideon the First died fighting the Beast, allowing his compartmentalised cavalier, Pyrrha Dve, to take permanent control. Still in a vision of the Locked Tomb where she first met the Body, Harrow climbs into the empty coffin and falls unconscious again. Six months in the future, an unknown person awakens in an apartment in an unnamed city with Camilla Hect.

The novel centers on Charles Yu, a 
time machine
 mechanic. He lives in his TM-31 time machine with his non-existent dog, Ed, and the time machine's depressed computer, TAMMY. Yu travels through Minor Universe 31 fixing time machines of people who try to fix the past. He visits Linus Skywalker who tried to kill his father, 
Luke Skywalker
 because his father's fame overshadowed Linus's life. Yu also visits a girl who traveled to be with her grandmother as she died. Yu explains to her that because she wasn't present when it happened, she cannot stay.

Yu is called in by his boss, Phil, to have his time machine serviced. He walks around in the city while his TM-31 is being repaired and visits his mother who is in a time loop in which she continually replays an hour of her life. He watches a holographic version of himself and his mother interact as she serves dinner.

The next day Yu rushes back to his time machine, sees his future self exit his machine, and shoots his future self. As his future self is dying, the future self gives Yu a book and says that the book is the key. By shooting himself, Yu has entered a loop in which he must eventually travel back in time, hand his past self the book, and get shot.

Yu quickly takes off in his time machine and begins to rewrite the book by reading from the book he was handed. He eventually asks himself what would happen if he skipped forward, and so he jumps to the end of the book.

He wakes up in a Buddhist temple and sees ""The Woman My Mother Should Have Been"" as well as his father's shoes. He exits the temple and finds himself in a shuttle.

Yu finds himself back in his TM-31 and floats through memories that he sees play out before him. He explains how he and his father invented the time machine and brought it to the director of research at the Institute of Conceptual Technology. Yu's father explained the concepts but was unable to get his machine to work.

Back in the TM-31, Yu finds a key in the book he is writing that leads him to discover a diorama with a clock that points to a time. TAMMY and Yu realize that this is a clue to where they can find Yu's father, but also realize that they are headed back to the hangar so Yu's past self can shoot him.

Yu realizes as he flies in that he loves TAMMY and she loves him. He steps out of his time machine and gets shot, but lives as it was just a shot to his stomach.

In the appendix, Yu talks about visiting the place and time displayed by the diorama. He finds his father, trapped because his time machine broke down. Yu makes amends with his father and then travels to the present. He reunites his parents, then sets off to find ""The Woman You Never Married"". He continues to write his novel, but suggests he ""keep stalling, see how long you can keep expanding the infinitely expandable moment""."

The narrator, Walker Easterling, is a film actor and screenwriter. His director friend Nicholas Sylvian introduces him to Maris York, a sculptor who makes model cities and who is freeing herself from Luc, her abusive partner. On the day Maris and Walker meet, Luc has just threatened to kill her, so Walker and Nicholas take her away to 
Vienna
, where Maris and Walker commence a relationship. Walker, who knows nothing about his parents or family background, discovers that he can perform magical acts and has dreams of inhabiting another identity, that of an Austrian named Moritz Benedikt who fought in the 
First World War
 and was subsequently murdered. After Maris' brother Ingram loses his lover in an earthquake, Walker is able to foretell, or induce, Ingram's meeting with a certain Michael Billa, who will be a significant person in Ingram's life. (The consequences of Ingram's and Billa's friendship are recounted in 
Black Cocktail
.) Through an acquaintance, screenwriter Philip Strayhorn, Walker meets Venasque, a mystic and teacher who appears in several other Carroll books. With Venasque's help, Walker learns to control his talent, but inadvertently causes Venasque's death because of the strength of his powers. He is contacted by his real father, a little man with no genitals whose name he does not know. The little man is an immortal (and the real-life source of the 
Rumpelstiltskin
 legend) who has murdered all Walker's previous incarnations, the last of whom was Moritz Benedikt, because they kept falling in love with women and repudiating the little man's sterile immortality. His father tries to persuade Walker to leave Maris by telling him that she'll mourn him forever and never love anyone else; this above all persuades Walker that his father is selfish and evil. Thanks to his and Maris' complete understanding of each other, Walker is able to discover his father's name in a city which Maris is building him as a birthday present. Walker uses his magic powers to call up the two sisters who originally told the Rumpelstiltskin story to the 
Grimm brothers
. The sisters retell the story, changing it to end with the little man's death. Soon after Maris' and Walker's son is born, a little girl (apparently the original source of the 
Little Red Riding Hood
 story) appears on the doorstep and tells Walker: ""You're dangerous."" As Walker observes that ""nothing in life is done without regret"", it seems that his and Maris' son has been affected in some way by the vengeful immortals."

Valeria watches the launch of the 
Peerless
 from the home world, waiting for its return. Six generations later, a suitable time has come to turn the ship around. A solution for the home world is in sight. But the crew is split into two fractions, one wanting to continue the mission and one instead wanting to find a new home in the orthogonal cluster. After a vote is held, the 
Peerless
 turns around and (with an inverted 
arrow of time
) begins the long voyage home. Agata talks with Medoro about the new possibility of using the inverted light of orthogonal stars to send messages back in time, but a discussion only parts the 
Peerless
 further. After a vote in favor of the system, a bomb kills the group responsible for its construction, including Medoro. Some strongly against it like Ramiro are imprisoned. Meanwhile, the discovery of an inhabitable world called Esilio in the orthogonal cluster seems to pose a solution to the conflict, but time is running backwards there. A journey to Esilio is planned. Examining light bent by the gravity of its sun could also verify Lila's theory (corresponding to 
General relativity
).

Agata, Ramiro, Tarquinia and Azelio fly to Esilio with the 
Surveyor
 using an orthogonal course just like the 
Peerless
. Twelve years will pass for them while only four years will pass on board the 
Peerless
. After reaching Esilio, Lila's theory is confirmed. On the surface, they have to deal with many odd consequences of the opposite arrow of time, including having to detonate a rock to enforce their own onto the soil to make their plants grow. Agata finds a message carved into a stone in the crater, which is from the ancestors giving them their gratitude from when Esilio flew past the home world. They fly back with the knowledge of the ultimate success of the grand mission of the 
Peerless
.

When approaching the 
Peerless
, they learn of the successful construction of the messaging system. Everything about their journey is already common knowledge. Contrary to expectation, the system has blocked any new innovation. But it will completely shut down in a while with no hint at a reason sent back before. The crew discusses about a manual shutdown or manipulation being better than a complete destruction of the 
Peerless
 by a collision (if it could be averted at all) and build probes to obstruct the orthogonal stars in front of the cameras. After their arrival back on board, they learn about the still ongoing division of society with some thinking the shutdown will be a trick. Agata and Ramiro both learn of a plan to destroy the cameras (which use light from the entire othogonal cluster, rendering bare obstruction impossible) by detonations from space by Giacomo, who used the messaging system he despises nonetheless to plan ahead knowing about the probes of the 
Surveyor
 and Agata's condition (whose future self still doesn't agree to the current plan) to even abandon it in the last moment if she finds a less dangerous solution. Ramiro admits to Agata to have send Tarquinia to carve the message on Esilio, which therefore isn't from the ancestors and doesn't guarantee a safe future. Shortly before the disruption, Agata realizes that flooding the cameras with ordinary light can also cause a signal loss and heads out into space to move the bombs. The disruption takes place with only minor destruction and Agata survives injured. Tarquinia admits to Agata and Ramiro that she just couldn't uncarve the message on Esilio, which therefore was in fact from the ancestors. Agata tells them about the destruction of the messaging system having lifted the block on innovation with the recent one explaining how their entire existence is even possible.

One year after the departure of the 
Peerless
 from the home world, Valeria is woken up by screams as the sun has turned dark. Together with Eusebio and Silvio, she is brought to Clara, a traveler from the 
Peerless
 taking them into space. The 
Peerless
 flew another loop to arrive three years earlier (and also passed by itself on its former course). The sun (which in this universe is a burning rock) was extinguished and gigantic thrusters based on the 
eternal flame
 are now build on it to accelerate the entire system (through gravity) onto a parallel course with the Hurtlers, rendering them harmless. The destroyed Gemma will continue to provide light. Clara also shares insight into their society where males and females have been fused together and which prefers to stay on the 
Peerless
 and the far side of the sun. Valeria plans to come for a visit, but is saddened by the fact that she wouldn't be able to express her gratitude for past generations. Clara thinks that there will surely be a way.

The story follows a novelist on an island under the control of the Memory Police. An unknown force causes the people of the island to collectively 'forget' and lose their attachment to objects or concepts, e.g. hats, perfume, birds and ribbon. As the inhabitants move on from the disappearances, the Memory Police enforce the removal of the disappeared objects from the island. The people who continue to remember, such as the author's mother, attempt to escape from the island or hide in safe houses to evade capture by the Police.

R, the author's editor, reveals himself to be one of those who still remembers the disappeared objects, and fears that he will be taken by the Memory Police. With the help of an old man, a family friend, the protagonist arranges and hides R in a secret room in her home. While hiding, R then tries to help them recall some of the long disappeared objects to the author and the old man, though to no avail.

As the calendars disappear, the winter continues and spring never comes. Food is becoming scarce on the island. The Memory Police raid the author's house as they celebrate the old man's birthday, but fail to discover the secret room, leaving them free. Subsequently, novels disappear as well, and the protagonist works as a typist. On R's insistence, she continues to work on her novel and keeps some books. After an earthquake, some of her mother's sculptures, given back by a family friend, break and reveal more objects that had disappeared, including a ferry ticket and a

Fang Runin (""Rin"") is a war orphan in the Nikan Empire whose foster parents employ her in their 
opium
 smuggling. She secretly studies for a national test to escape an arranged marriage and places first in her province, which sends her north to Sinegard, the imperial capital and home of the military academy.

Mocked for being a poor southerner, Rin excels in her studies. She becomes friends with Chen Kitay, the son of a minister, and enemies with Yin Nezha, the son of one of the twelve regional warlords. She also looks up to the school's star student, Altan Trengsin, who is from the island of Speer. Speerly soldiers served the empire by wielding shamanic fire powers from their god, the 
Phoenix
, until being massacred by the Mugen Federation in a previous war. Rin attracts the attention of Master Jiang, who develops her talent for 
shamanism
. She wins the first year tournament over Nezha, is enthralled by the appearance of the empress Su Daji at a festival, and is taught by Jiang how to access the magic of the gods via meditation and 
psychedelic drugs
.

In her third year, the Mugen Federation invades Nikan and seeks to capture Sinegard. Master Jiang disappears after using shamanistic powers to summon monsters to bring down the gate that Rin and Nezha were defending on the Mugenese army. In the aftermath, Rin faints after using the power of the Phoenix to immolate an enemy general who impaled Nezha, which prompts a Mugenese retreat. Rin learns she is a Speerly, and to avoid the warlords fighting over her, she is selected to join the Cike, a misfit unit of mostly-shaman imperial assassins now led by Altan.

The Cike are sent to the southern port city of Kurdalain, where despite a successful strike on Mugenese reinforcements, Rin struggles to access the Phoenix. She reunites with Nezha who apologises to her for his treatment of her in Sinegard, and they kill one of the monsters released by Jiang. After prolonged street fighting, Altan become disillusioned and Nezha is lost during a Mugenese 
chemical attack
. The Cike realize that the Kurdalain siege is a feint and travel to the wartime capital of Golyn Niis to find the city destroyed and its inhabitants massacred by the Mugenese. Sifting through the wreckage, they discover Kitay, who informs them that the empress had fled the city before the massacre, and Venka, Rin's former roommate, who was raped and begs Rin to avenge her.

Altan decides that the only way to win the war is to unleash former members of the Cike who are entombed alive after going mad in a mountain prison where their powers are suppressed. Having gotten approval from the empress, Altan sets off with Rin. There, they find Jiang who had imprisoned himself after losing control of his power. He refuses to help them and accuses Altan of only wanting revenge for his people. After releasing Feylen, a former Cike with wind powers, nearly results in Altan's death, the pair decide to leave but are captured by a Mugenese ambush.

Rin and Altan are taken to a Mugenese science facility and experimented on with opium. They learn that the empress had sold out Nikan and betrayed their mission for her own life. The opium helps Rin awaken her power and Altan sacrifices himself as a diversion for Rin to escape the mainland to go to Speer. There she finds the Phoenix's temple, channels the god's unlimited fire, and destroys the primary island of the Mugenese homeland. In the aftermath, Rin awakens on a ship crewed by the Cike and Kitay, who is horrified by what she has done. She learns that Altan named her Cike commander and vows to use her newfound powers to take revenge on the empress for her treachery."

aliens
.

The central section of the book is based on McCaffrey's earlier short story ""Lady in the Tower"".



Characters
[
edit
]


The Rowan/Angharad Gwyn
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-1 telekinetic/telepath; Callisto Prime


Physical description: with silver-white hair and grey eyes (though stated to be brown on page 17 of the Ace/Putnam 1990 hardcover edition), she has a petite, ""bird like"" figure.

The Rowan is the only survivor of a freak mudslide that destroyed the Rowan Mining Camp on Altair. Trapped in a hopper (ground vehicle) and buried in sludge for days, the 3 year-old toddler's mental cries for help reach every telepath on the planet. Rescued, she is made a ""Ward of the Planet"" but, with no memory of her life before the mudslide, becomes known as ""the Rowan child"". She grows up under the care of Lusena, a child therapist who becomes her foster mother.


Well aware of her Prime potential, her guardians move her to Altair's Tower at the age of twelve, to be instructed in the use of her Talent by Altair's Prime, Siglen. After a difficult learning curve and lonely adolescence she ultimately reaches Prime status and is installed on 
Jupiter
's moon, 
Callisto
.


Siglen
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-1 telekinetic/telepath; Altair Prime


Physical description: Siglen was a slab of a female, soft from a sedentary life and a disinclination to exercise of any kind.

Siglen proved to be more harm than good when it came to dealing with the Rowan. She wasn't empathic towards the child and instilled a 
neurosis
 (a form of 
agoraphobia
 that prevents interstellar teleports) in the three Primes that she trained. She has no empathy and is very trying for her staff and personnel to deal with. She is described as a ""mistress of the putdown"" and a generally unlikeable person.


Lusena
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-8 telepath; junior therapist

Lusena took the young Rowan in as her own. She already had two older children, Bardy and Finnan. Lusena died in a crash when the Rowan was eighteen.


Goswina Lyon
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-5 empath

Goswina first met the Rowan when she, along with seven other young Talents, traveled to Altair for a course on Tower management and maintenance. She soon realized that she and the Rowan could not work efficiently together and so recommended her brother Afra, who at the time was six. The Rowan then promised to make sure Afra came to Altair for the course when he was old enough.


Afra Lyon
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-4 (later T-3 then T-2) telekinetic/telepath


Physical description: blonde hair, slightly green skin, yellow eyes, tall/slender figure.

The Lyon family is from Capella, a ""Methody"" planet known for its adherence to rules and manners (and its colonists' unusual pigmentation). Afra, however, was slightly different; life on Capella didn't appeal to him. At eighteen, Afra spent all his money to send a resume to the Rowan, the new Callisto Prime. The Prime sent for him the very next day. Afra was to the Rowan's liking and became second in command of the Tower.


Jeff Raven
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-1 telekinetic/telepath


Physical description: black hair and piercing blue eyes.

Jeff Raven was born on Deneb where a large population of ""Wild Talents"" resides. He first contacted the Rowan telepathically when he ""heard"" her getting ready to start her transportation work on Callisto. Jeff informed her that Deneb was under attack by hostile alien forces. The Rowan informed Earth Prime who refused to believe the words of an ""unknown Talent""; Jeff quickly verified the attack was legitimate by telekinetically hurtling a missile towards Earth (which was quite an extraordinary feat considering how remote Deneb was and that the generator he tapped into for power was on the verge of collapse)


Isthia Raven
[
edit
]


Talent level: never tested, but she has a ""long ear"" and ""loud voice"".

Isthia is the mother of Jeff Raven. She gathered a team of other untrained Talents to help her contact the Rowan telepathically when Jeff was badly injured in an accident after the attacks.


Peter Reidinger IV
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-1 telekinetic/telepath; Earth Prime


Physical description: Black hair, close trimmed red beard and moustache. He is the descendant of the same Peter Reidinger who is featured in 
Pegasus in Flight
 and 
Pegasus in Space
.


The Reidinger family is full of extremely high Talents, and Peter Reidinger IV is surely one of the most powerful. He runs FT&T.


Elizara Matheson
[
edit
]


Talent level: T-1 Medic/Ob. Deft, compassionate, sensible and reassuring, Elizara is Prime Reidinger's great-granddaughter. She became a close friend and confidant of the Gwyn-Raven families, and later the Lyons, when she was assigned by Reidinger to assist the Rowan during her first pregnancy. Elizara is extremely skilled in metamorphic healing as well as physical. She is later re-introduced into the series as the very talented teacher of her gifted namesake, Zara Raven-Lyon, one of 
Damia
's many children.


Brian Ackerman
[

Talent Level: T-9; Callisto Stationmaster



Primes
[
edit
]


Primes of FT&T are T-1 telekinetic/telepaths. They are the rarest manifestation of Talent:



Earth Prime: Peter Reidinger IV


Altair Prime: Siglen


Capella Prime: Capella

This book takes place about fifteen years after the end of the original story, when survivors of the Dalton-Quinn tree, a few Carther States jungle dwellers, and two London Tree Citizens have settled on a new tree. This 'Citizen's Tree' has become a stable community which some believe may be too small to survive in the long run.

Kendy, the recorded personality of a citizen of ""
The State
"" who exists in the computer of the original space-ship that colonized the Smoke Ring, has become impatient. He decides to re-establish contact with Citizen's Tree. Kendy manipulates a group into making contact with ""The Admiralty"", a neighboring civilization at Gold's L4 
Lagrange Point
 (which they refer to as ""the Clump""). The group explores this more advanced civilization with a mixture of wonder and trepidation.

Although much of the story is a sort of ""
travelogue
"" exploring the Smoke Ring and the technology used in the unique environment, 
The Smoke Ring
 does spend more time on story and character development than 
The Integral Trees
. One of the drivers for the story follows the latest operator of ""the silver suit"", the Citizen's Tree's working spacesuit. Few are capable of operating the suit due to its size; due to the lack of gravity, most humans in the Smoke Ring grow too tall to fit into it. The job goes to the occasionally born ""dwarves"" who tend to develop into humans of Earth-normal height and build. A major sub-plot develops around the latest silver suit operator's attempts to infiltrate The Admiralty to gain information, and The Admiralty's near obsession with capturing the Citizen's Tree's spacesuit.

This focuses  on the story of Kendy and the original mission. The chain of events that led to the colonization of the Smoke Ring through a ""mutiny"" on the ship is explored. After retrieving the crew's own records of the events, Kendy realizes that the crew had not mutinied at all, and that he had forced them off the ship, believing this to be in keeping with his orders from Earth. This was apparently blocked from his memory, and he suffers a form of breakdown when he learns (or re-learns) the truth."

60,000 years in the future, on a private terraformed planet, worker slaves of an interstellar real estate corporation, Verdance, have transformed the planet, Sask-E, from an anoxic wasteland into an oxygen-rich planet habitable by 
H. sapiens
. Destry, a member of a team dedicated to continuing the planet's transformation, uncovers Spider, a secret underground city founded by escaped slaves who chose not to go extinct 10,000 years ago. City residents include a diverse set of people, including bots, cats, cows, mole rats, moose, beavers, and the non-oxygen-breathing 
H. diversus
 Archaeans descended from the first terraformers. Destry's team secretly helps resolve a water shortage problem by redirecting a river using an engineered lava eruption. They observe that the eruption was controlled by bot people living in the mantle. These people also chose not to go extinct and continue to maintain ribbons, artificial 
plate tectonic
 infrastructure from an early terraforming phase. Upon learning that the ribbons still exist, Verdance declares war on Spider, firing orbital lasers. Verdance employees rebel. Destry is able to force Verdance to sign a treaty, granting Spider limited sovereignty under threat of the ribbons.

700 years later, a new team composed of Spider residents (an Archaean named Sulfur and a bot) and Verdance employees (a cow and an 
H. sapiens
) are tasked with performing an environmental survey and creating a planetary inter-city public transit plan for Verdance and the largest landowner, Emerald. They tour several settlements and observe that both Verdance and Emerald aim to keep Sask-E a private planet by hamstringing all public services in favor of private ones. In protest, the team recommends establishing a community of self-governing 
anti-gravity
 train people under Spider sovereignty as the best long-term solution for providing transport. Emerald approves the plan, ignoring the sovereignty implications. Spider bioengineers birth the first trains.

904 years later, Scrubjay, a member of the Flying Train Fleet worker co-op, befriends Moose, a homeless journalist cat, who is digging up dirt against Sask-E's monopoly landowner Emerald. Moose teaches Scrubjay about protests to make Sask-E a public planet in response to widespread 
gentrification
 problems. They help evacuate refugees evicted by lethal orbital strikes fired by Emerald to cleanse its cities of unslaved non-
H. sapiens
. Scrubjay and Moose uncover ancient legal documents that prove Emerald defrauded real estate customers by charging license fees for public domain 
H. sapiens
 genome sequences. They also discover that Emerald's approval of the self-governing train community also disqualifies Sask-E from private planet status in the interstellar government. Spider and the Flying Train Fleet vote not to activate the ribbons in response to the orbital strikes and to apply for recognition by the wider interstellar government as governments of a public planet."

In 
The Unlimited Dream Company
, a man named Blake crashes a stolen aircraft into the 
River Thames
 outside the Surrey suburb of 
Shepperton
.
[

]
 Whether he survives the crash, to become a sort of supernatural messiah for the small town, or if he actually drowns, and dying, imagines the whole thing, is never truly revealed.
[
2
]
 Contradictory hints are scattered throughout the novel which may support both interpretations.

Since the story is told by Blake in the first person, we know what he wants us to know, and we are only told what he chooses to tell us. In the first chapter of the novel, where Blake outlines his life before the air accident, there are elements that may make us suspect that he is insane, so that he is an absolutely 
unreliable narrator
.

Blake has extraordinary powers: he can fly, heal sick people, 
phagocytize
 other people whenever he likes; but he cannot leave the suburbs, though he repeatedly tries to get away. Moreover, Blake is obsessed by the relic of the small 
Cessna
 aircraft that he crash-landed in, which has been left submerged in the Thames. This might support the hypothesis that he is dead and is only imagining the strange events of the story.

However, there is a crucial moment when Blake, who is about to absorb all the citizens of Shepperton in order to gain energy to escape the suburb, is shot by Stark, another loner who manages a rickety zoo. The wound triggers a deep inner change in the character, who gets rid of his cannibalistic drives and becomes more human and compassionate. He then helps other people to escape Shepperton, and remains there alone, waiting for the return of the woman he loves, Miriam St. Cloud.

As well as the protagonist's name, the novel draws on the works of 
William Blake
,
[

]
 particularly his epic work 
Milton: A Poem
[

]
 in other ways. The surreal descriptions of Shepperton's transformation are drawn in part from William Blake's psychogeographical descriptions of London, while the final confrontation between Blake and the corpse of the drowned pilot (which he comes to realise is himself) echoes that between Milton and Satan at the end of 
Milton a Poem

As 1943 begins, the Race attempts to consolidate its hold over 
Latin America
, 
Africa
, and 
Australia
 while it is engaged in a fierce struggle with the advanced nations of the world: the 
United States
, the 
United Kingdom
, the 
Soviet Union
, 
Japan
, and 
Nazi Germany
. While capable of resisting the invaders, mankind has been dealt a heavy blow by the nemesis from the stars. The Race maintains its unquestioned 
air supremacy
 over the entire world as humans are reduced to moving their ground forces by night and using their own aircraft only in the direst emergencies. With supplies of 
petroleum
 severely limited, people have taken to using 
horse-driven
 
carriages
 to replace 
automobiles
 and 
kerosene lamps
 to replace 
electric lights
. But even as the human race huddles in the darkness, physicists and engineers work desperately to develop the first human atomic bombs, which represent what might be the only hope of driving the Race off Earth.

After a rapid conquest of 
Spain
 and 
Portugal
 and the capitulation of 
Italy
, the Race focuses on driving its forces in France eastward, toward the heart of the German Reich. Among the officers of the 
Wehrmacht
 struggling desperately to hold back the tide of the alien forces is Colonel Heinrich Jäger. Fresh from his stay in Hitler's 
Berchtesgaden
 retreat, Jäger is puzzled by the relationship he has formed with Senior Lieutenant Ludmila Gorbunova, the Ukrainian pilot who flew Soviet Foreign Minister 
Vyacheslav Molotov
 to 
Bavaria
 for a conference with the 
Führer
. He is much enamoured with her but wonders if love can develop between two former enemies.

Jäger is given command of a 
panzer
 regiment near 
Belfort
 and is charged with keeping the Race from reaching the 
Rhine
. Although the latest panzer models, the 
Panther
 and the 
Tiger I
, give the Germans a fighting chance, they are still woefully inferior to the Race's 
landcruisers
. For their part, the aliens are stunned that humans are capable of designing and deploying new tank models within such a short space of time, as the Race's rate of technological development is centuries slower. Jäger is abruptly pulled out of frontline service and ordered to assist the German atomic bomb program in 
Wittelsbach
.

In the United States, Jens Larssen, a physicist, leaves 
Chicago
 in search of the metallurgical laboratory that has relocated to 
Denver
. After crossing the 
Great Lakes
, he moves swiftly across 
Minnesota
 and the 
Dakotas
. Larssen is not so much driven by the need to hasten atomic bomb development as he is by a desire to be reunited with his wife, Barbara. Unfortunately for Jens, under the impression that he is dead, Barbara has started a relationship with Corporal Sam Yeager, a soldier responsible for guarding captured alien prisoners of war. Yeager serves as a translator for the metallurgical lab since he has learned the rudiments of the Race's language. Jens arrives in Denver before the lab and sends a courier out to find Barbara with a message that he remains alive. Barbara learns that her husband is still alive just after she revealed to Yeager that she is pregnant.

In 
Illinois
, after the successful drive by 
Patton
 that liberated much of the state, the Race begins to advance upon Chicago once more. US soldiers fight valiantly, but the flat open country gives the alien landcruisers a decisive advantage. Slowly but surely, the Race draws closer and closer toward 
Lake Michigan
.

Jäger manages to return to the front lines in Belfort after an unproductive stay with German physicists working on atomic research in Wittelsbach. Not long afterwards, Wittelsbach is destroyed by an out-of-control nuclear reaction produced by 
Nazi
 scientists. The resulting 
nuclear meltdown
 alerts the Race to the virtual certainty that Germany is engaged in 
nuclear research
.

It is not alone. On Stalin's behalf, Molotov visits a secret research laboratory several miles north of 
Moscow
 that has Soviet researchers struggling to turn the sample of 
plutonium
 that had been captured by German-Soviet forces in Ukraine the year before into an atomic device. They have minimal success and Molotov attempts to encourage them with threats of torture and death if they fail. That produces no marked improvement in the advances made by Soviet engineers.

In Japan, a captured 
killercraft
 pilot of the Race, Teerts, is interrogated by Japanese researchers attempting to understand the dynamics of 
nuclear fission
. As a pilot, Teerts claims to have limited knowledge of atomic weapons, as he drops them, not builds them. The Japanese refuse to believe him and use 
torture
 to make Teerts more cooperative.

In the United States, the metallurgical laboratory finally reaches Denver and begins working on atomic research. Its work is helped by a small shipment of plutonium that Colonel Leslie Groves brings from 
Boston
, where a British 
submarine
 had been entrusted with delivering it to the US government. The plutonium is one-fourth of the material stolen from the Race during the German-Soviet operation in 
Ukraine
. It had come into the possession of the British by way of Jewish partisans, who had commandeered a portion of the plutonium consigned to Germany when they briefly held Colonel Jäger in captivity in 
Poland
 the previous winter. Unfortunately, the plutonium in question is not enough to build an 
atomic bomb
. The metallurgical lab must produce a substantial amount of the precious plutonium before Americans can hope to wield a nuclear device in the war against the Race.

Jens Larssen meets with his wife upon her arrival in Denver and learns that she has married and become impregnated by Corporal Sam Yeager. In a difficult decision that leaves everyone emotionally upset, she decides to keep the baby and to remain with Yeager. Jens takes the news badly, and his work on the atomic bomb project suffers. To keep him out of trouble, Groves orders Larssen to travel to 
Hanford
 and to consider the possibility of transferring the metallurgical lab there to facilitate the production of plutonium. With an 
M1903 Springfield rifle
 slung over his shoulder, Jens heads off to Washington State on a bicycle.

Jäger, supervising the efforts to recover plutonium from the melted-down reactor in Wittelsbach, is recruited by SS 
Standartenführer
 
Otto Skorzeny
 to help take back the city of 
Split
 from the Race, who have been offering the 
Independent State of Croatia
 incentives to turn away from the Germans and toward them. It is also an effort to lure Skorzeny into Split to be killed. However, Skorzeny and Jäger, with superior maps, dig a tunnel into the middle of the Race's garrison, and, with numerous Croat soldiers and 
FG 42
 battle rifles, which are superior to the Race's infantry weapons, completely reduce the garrison. Every member of the Race in Split is either killed or taken prisoner. Among the dead is Fleetlord Atvar's chief intelligence officer, Drefsab.

As the summer of 1943 begins, forces of the Race creep closer to Germany and have reached the outskirts of Chicago. Moscow appears to be on the brink of collapse when the Race advance is abruptly stopped by the human detonation of an atomic bomb, planted as a 
landmine
, between 
Kaluga
 and Moscow. The story ends with the balance of power in the scope of the conflict dramatically redefined."

Introduction
[
edit
]


In 
Count Zero
 Gibson presents ""a high-tech near-future of linked super-computers... [a matrix that] has given rise to ""cyberspace,"" an ""inner"" space something like a three-dimensional video display... [in a] world is dominated by multinational corporations... a few fabulously rich individuals, and the cutthroat competition between them.""
[
1
]
 Seven years after the events of 
Neuromancer
, strange things begin to happen in the Matrix, leading to the proliferation of what appear to be 
voodoo
 
gods
 (hinted to be the fractured remains of the joined AIs that were Neuromancer and Wintermute). Two powerful 
multinational corporations
, Maas Biolabs and Hosaka, are engaged in a battle for control over a powerful new technology, a biochip, using hackers and the Matrix as well as espionage and violence.



Expansive plot summary
[
edit
]


As with later Gibson works,
[
citation needed
]
 
Count Zero
 has multiple story-lines; in it, a trio of plot lines ultimately converge:
[
1
]


Thread One
:  In the southwestern US, Turner, a corporate 
mercenary soldier
, has been hired by former partner Conroy to help Christopher Mitchell, a brilliant researcher and 
bio-hacker
, make an illegal career move from Maas' corporate fortress built into a 
mesa
 in the Arizona desert to Hosaka, a rival corporation. The attempt is a disaster, and Turner ends up escaping with Angie Mitchell, the scientist's young daughter, instead. Implanted in her brain by her father, she carries the secret plans of the construction of the valuable ""biosoft"" that has made Maas so influential and powerful.  This ""biosoft"" is what multibillionaire Josef Virek (see thread three) ruthlessly pursues so that he can make an evolutionary jump to something resembling 
omniscience
 and 
immortality
. During their flight from both Maas and Hosaka agents, Turner and Angie stay with Rudy, the former's estranged brother, and Sally, his partner and caretaker. Rudy identifies a device implanted in Angie's skull: her father had apparently altered her nervous system to allow her to access the Cyberspace Matrix directly, without a ""deck"" (a computer with an interface directly into the user's brain), but she is not aware of this. During their stay, Turner has a one-night stand with Sally and then leaves with Angie. In the Sprawl he meets with Bobby's group in a shopping mall besieged by agents of Maas and Conroy.

Thread Two
:  In Barrytown, New Jersey a young amateur computer hacker, Bobby Newmark, self-named ""Count Zero"", is given a piece of black market software by some criminal associates ""to test"". When he plugs himself into the matrix and runs the program, it almost kills him. The only thing that saves his life is a sudden image of a girl made of light who interferes and unhooks him from the software just before he flatlines. After fleeing his house (which is immediately thereafter destroyed) he meets Lucas, Beauvoir, and Jackie, a group fascinated by and dedicated to the recent appearance of voodoo deities in Cyberspace, who take him into their protection as they are collectively targeted by various corporate agents. It is eventually revealed that Bobby's mysterious savior is Angie (see Thread One); the two only meet physically at the very end of the book.

Thread Three
:  Marly Krushkova, the former owner of a Paris art gallery whose reputation was destroyed when she was tricked into trying to sell a forgery, is recruited by ultra-rich, reclusive art 
patron
 Josef Virek to find the unknown creator of a series of futuristic collage boxes styled after the work of 
Joseph Cornell
. Unbeknownst to her, the reason behind Virek's interest in these boxes is related to indications of biosoft construction in the design of one, which he suspects may be contained in the others.

These plotlines come together at the end of the story. Virek—the hunter of immortality and unlimited power—becomes the hunted. It is hinted that multiple AIs inhabiting cyberspace are the fragmented, compartmentalized remains of two AIs, Neuromancer and Wintermute (introduced in the first book of Gibson's Sprawl series, 
Neuromancer
), having joined. The AIs were designed by the head of a multi-generational techno-oligarchical family, the Tessier-Ashpools. These AI units now interface with humanity in the form of different Haitian voodoo gods, as they have found these constructs to be the best representations of themselves for communicating.  Hackers worldwide are becoming aware that there is something weird loose in the cyberspace matrix, but most are reluctant to talk about (or deal with) ""voodoo spooks"" supposedly haunting cyberspace.  The ""voodoo gods"" gave Mitchell the information to develop the biosoft, instructing him to insert a biosoft modification in his daughter's brain, and then sent the Cornell boxes into the world to attract and enable the disposal of the malicious Virek.

A pair of epilogue chapters resolve the fates of the protagonists, until 
Mona Lisa Overdrive
. Angie has attained celebrity status as a simstim star, and has entered a relationship with Bobby who is employed as her 'bodyguard'. Marly has returned to Paris and now curates one of the largest art galleries in the city. Turner has returned to his childhood home (the same one occupied by Rudy and Sally earlier in the book) to raise the child conceived during his affair with Sally; Rudy was killed by Conroy's agents when they were trailing Turner and Angie.

The Cyberspace Matrix, a synergistically linked computer network of databases that encompasses all information on Earth, has become home to sentient beings. But most of humanity remains unaware.

Ace
 paperback edition with cover art by 
Richard Berry
.


Bobby Newmark
. At the beginning of the novel, Bobby is a small-time ""cowboy"" (
hacker
) who wants to be a big name in cyberspace. He is given what he naïvely trusts is an ""ICE breaker"" (hacking software), unaware that he is in fact being used to test some unknown software to see what it does. He is directed to use the software to infiltrate a 
black ICE
 database which nearly ends up killing him. The acronym ICE is shorthand for ""Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics"". The most formidable of these data defense networks are powerful enough to trace back and kill any hacker making an attempt to defeat them. This is legally sanctioned or is, at least, not illegal. But at the last moment Bobby is rescued, while in Cyberspace and dying, by an image of a girl, Angela Mitchell, who is somehow able to enter cyberspace without using a ""deck"" (computer).

Bobby realizes his target must now know where he lives, so he flees. Shortly after leaving his apartment, he is brutally mugged for his deck and left for dead, only to be rescued and given medical attention by the owners of the software Bobby tried out, a small group who are very interested in what happened to him in Cyberspace. Bobby and Angela (who are roughly the same age) meet at the end of the book. Bobby makes a minor appearance in the third Sprawl novel, 
Mona Lisa Overdrive
.

Turner
. Turner (the only name by which he is known in the novel) is a 
mercenary
 who is employed by various 
corporations
 to help vital employees of competing corporations ""defect"" to Turner's employers.  The novel begins with an account of a job in 
New Delhi
 in which Turner was nearly killed by a Slamhound, a type of mobile 
bomb
.  After three months of reconstructive 
surgery
 in 
Singapore
, Turner takes a vacation in 
Mexico
, where he meets and becomes sexually involved with a woman named Allison.  While on the beach with Allison, Turner sees a familiar yacht close to shore and a powerboat from the yacht approaching the beach, bearing the logo of the Hosaka Corporation.  Turner tells Allison to leave while he waits for the raft's passenger to come ashore.  He already knows that the passenger is Conroy, another mercenary with whom Turner has worked in the past.  Conroy recruits Turner for another ""extraction"" job; this time, Conroy and Turner are to help a man named Christopher Mitchell leave Maas Biolabs for Hosaka.  Mitchell carries with him the expertise to design and manufacture ""biochips"", a technology superior to the nearly ubiquitous silicon 
microprocessors
 of the era.  Maas Biolabs holds the patents and secrets to biochip technology and will use every means it can to prevent Mitchell's escape.  Conroy also reveals that Allison is a ""field 
psychologist
"" working for Hosaka to monitor Turner and help his recovery.

Turner is a disciplined professional, but is troubled by memories of past jobs that ended tragically as well as his relationship with his gifted brother Rudy (who is a reclusive 
alcoholic
 and 
drug
 addict).  Turner comes to realize that the unsuccessful attempt to ""bring over"" Christopher Mitchell from Maas to Hosaka resulted from a betrayal and suspects that Conroy is behind it.  He also recognizes that Angie Mitchell was sent out from the Maas facility by her father, and that she is in grave danger. He resolves to protect her while finding out who is pursuing her and why.

Marly Krushkhova
. Marly, prior to the beginning of the story, operated a small art gallery in Paris.  She became notorious as a result of the disgrace from attempting to sell a forged box 
assemblage
 that was supposedly a lost piece by the American sculptor 
Joseph Cornell
. She was unaware that the piece was a fake, having been duped by her then-lover Alain, the gallery's co-owner, who had embezzled money from the gallery to finance the forgery. Unemployed and living with her friend Andrea, Marly receives a job offer from the immensely wealthy businessman Josef Virek.  During her interview, conducted via a very advanced 
simstim
 link, Virek informs Marly that he has collected several remarkable box assemblages similar to those created by Cornell.  Virek then hires Marly to find out who is producing the pieces, offering her unlimited financial support during the course of her search.

Although Marly welcomes the opportunity to get out of her current situation, she does not fully trust the mysterious and secretive Virek.  This mistrust only deepens when it becomes clear that she is being followed and monitored by Virek's agents, in particular Virek's right-hand man, Paco.  Marly tries to stay a step ahead of Virek and Paco while discovering the identity of the boxes' creator.

We're in a high-tech near-future of linked super-computers; this matrix has given rise to ""cyberspace,"" an ""inner"" space something like a three-dimensional video display (cf. the movie Tron); the world is dominated by multinational corporations, plus a few fabulously rich individuals, and the cutthroat competition between them. The three plot lines here eventually intertwine."

Creation Node
 begins in 2255 when Earth has recovered from a series of climatic and ecological disasters. Humanity has split into three socio-political alliances, the Lunar Consortium who mine whatever resources they can find on the Moon and elsewhere, the Earth-based Conservers who prohibit the use of non-renewable resources, and the Earth World Government. A group of Conservers have discovered the hypothesised 
Planet Nine
 in the 
Oort cloud
 at the outer edge of the 
Solar System
, four 
light-days
 from Earth. They left Earth 35 years ago in their 
solar powered
 craft, 
Shadow
, and have found that Planet Nine appears to be a 
primordial black hole
 that is emitting 
Hawking radiation
. Furthermore, the crew of 
Shadow
 discover that the radiation has structure, suggesting it may be a message. When they reflect the ""message"" back, the black hole changes into an Earth-like, but featureless quasi-planet. Two of the crew land on the ""planet"" to investigate and find a 
sentient
 feathered humanoid alien they name ""Feathers"".

Feathers is taken aboard 
Shadow
, and the crew wonders whether it has a message for them. But attempts to communicate with it prove fruitless, leading to speculation that Feathers itself may be a message. When news of 
Shadow
's
 discovery reaches Earth, there is a scramble to get to Planet Nine. The World Government dispatches 
Cronus
, a 
fission powered
 space liner with representatives from Earth, the Conservers, and the Lunar Consortium. To speed up the trip to Planet Nine, 
Cronus
 first travels to a 
space habitat
 in orbit around Saturn to get a 
fusion drive
 fitted. The drive is powered by 
helium-3
, which is mined in Saturn's atmosphere via a 
space elevator
 attached to the habitat.

A god-like entity, Terminus appears in the form of a floating sphere and explains to the visitors that they are in another universe, one of many in the 
multiverse
. Terminus tells them of a plan to transform humanity's galaxy into a ""creation node"", from which an eternal cosmos would grow, one that would continually regenerate itself and never grow old and die. But Terminus cautions that the price for eternity is that their galaxy would have to be reset, destroying all life in it.

In the near future, Heather O'Grainn is a worker in the Office of Future Threat Assessment in 
Washington
 state. A variety of groups with diverse aims, but an overlapping desire to end modern technological society (which they call the Big System), create a 
nanotech
 plague (""Daybreak"") which both destroys petroleum-based fuels, rubber and plastics and eats away any metal conductors carrying electricity. An open question in the book is whether these groups, and their shared motivations, are coordinated by some conscious actor, or whether they are an 
emergent property
 / 
meme
 that attained a 
critical mass
.

The Daybreak plague strikes, and world governments are helpless to deal with it. Industrial civilization rapidly breaks down, and tens of millions die in the U.S. alone (the global death toll measures in the billions). There is a 
presidential succession
 crisis. Just as society in the U.S. seems to start stabilizing, previously placed 
pure fusion weapons
 detonate, destroying Washington, D.C. and Chicago. This is followed by additional pure fusion weapon strikes, which are determined to be weapons that are being created on the 
Moon
 by nanotech replicators. A shadowy 
neofeudalist
 group (the ""Castle movement"") led by a reactionary billionaire may be inadvertent saviors of society... or may have some deeper involvement in things."

Embassytown
 takes place mostly in the city of the title, on the planet Arieka. Embassytown is a colony of a state called Bremen; and its trade goods (precious metal and alien-influenced biotech), along with Embassytown's unique position at the edge of the known universe, make it a notable colony.

Avice Benner Cho, an ""Immerser"" (a traveller on the Immer, see 
§ Style
 below for the meaning of Miéville's neologisms), has returned to her childhood home from her adventures in the ""
Out
"". On the planet of Arieka humans and other ""exots"" co-exist with the indigenous, enigmatic Ariekei—otherwise known as the Hosts. Few people can speak the language of the Ariekei (referred to only as ""Language""), as it requires the orator to speak two words at once with one mind; those humans who can are genetically engineered twins known as Ambassadors, bred solely for this purpose. The Ambassadors can be understood by the Ariekei (who do not recognise any other form of communication) allowing for trade in their valuable biotechnology. Language does not allow for lying or even speculation, Language reflects both their state of mind and reality as the Ariekei perceive it; they create literal 
similes
 by recruiting individuals to perform activities that can then become allusions in Language.  Avice herself became a simile when younger, ""the girl who was hurt in the dark and ate what was given to her"". Ariekei compete at Festivals of Lies to see who can most closely approximate speaking an untruth, an act both thrilling and highly taboo.

The relationship between humans and Ariekei has proceeded in relative tranquillity for many years. However a new Ambassador arrives, named 
⁠
Ez
/
Ra
⁠
, who despite not being twins, is able to speak Language. The speech of the new Bremen-engineered Ambassador, regardless of words spoken, intoxicates any Ariekei exposed to it, and they become addicted to the extent that they cannot live without it.

A faction of the Ariekei deafen themselves to break their addiction and begin to violently convert others, developing increasingly sophisticated gesture-based communication. Avice is drawn into a search for a solution, having a special relationship with the Ariekei as a human simile. With assistance from sympathetic Ambassadors, she trains a small group of Hosts to be able to use metaphors and eventually utter lies. Due to the interconnectedness of thought and Language, this has the effect of altering their minds and now the words of 
⁠
Ez
/
Ra
⁠
 lose their addictive properties. The two Ariekei factions reconcile; freed from the literal nature of Language, they are able to learn new forms of communication, which also allows them to speak to non-Ambassador humans."

 A ""hive"" of eight bored wealthy women (who call themselves the ""Bee-Women,"" with Regina the queen bee) thinks it would be fun to raise the Devil, so they begin dabbling in ancient satanic rituals — much of which Bester portrays through 
musical notation
. Unaware that their rites are actually working, they do not summon Satan, but create a new, interdimensional demon: the Golem
100
. 

A beast of pure evil, it is raised again each time the group practices their ritual. Growing and expanding each time, it then embarks on a rampage of rape, torture and murder. The demon is tracked through the physical and spirit worlds by three unusual people. Blaise Shima is a famous chemist with an exceptional sense of smell, which makes him invaluable to his perfumery company. When he begins behaving oddly, taking midnight walks and losing chunks of his time to amnesia, the company brings in Gretchen Nunn, a blind woman who can ""see"" through the eyes of those around her, but can also can also see into parts of the spectrum beyond normal human ability. She is also an expert in 
psychodynamics

A local police officer, Subadar Ind'dni, joins them to find out what is causing the spike in violence. Ind'dni, a high-caste Hindu philosopher, is skeptical but is eventually convinced. The investigators take ""radioactive isotope"" drugs to help them with their search for the Golem

A man named ""Aristide"" adventures in the world of Midgarth, which was created as a medieval fantasy world. 
Genetic engineering
 it has populated it with ""fantasy"" races and its physical laws do not allow for the creation of 
firearms
. Aristide is the alias Pablo Monagas Perez, one of the most important figures in human society. Over a thousand years ago Perez had been part of the team which created artificial intelligence, thus launching humanity along its path to paradise.

Accompanied by his cat Bitsy, who is really an avatar of the supercomputer Endora, he is now dedicated to studying the ""implied spaces"" of the human constructed pocket universes: the places which were created as the byproduct of desired features. While working in Midgarth, Aristide learns of a series of particularly successful bandits preying on a local trade route. They are apparently led by a band of mysterious priests and kidnap their victims, who are never seen again.

Aristide and a group of travelers confront these bandits. During the confrontation, Aristide discovers that the priests who lead the bandits are able to create wormholes which transport their opponents to an unknown location. Worried by the advanced technology that these priests have, he takes some of their remains to his friend and former lover Daljit to be analyzed. When it is determined that the priests were in fact ""pod people"", illegal artificial lifeforms, they become worried that someone is engaged in a plot to bring down civilization.

Aristide and Daljit conclude that the priests were abducting people in order to reprogram then to serve the priests' unknown masters. Checking records they discover that there has been a rash of unsolved disappearances in the archipelago universe Hawaiki. Aristide travels there where he encounters agents of the conspiracy and narrowly misses being kidnapped, although he loses Bitsy in the process. Returning to his home universe Topaz he informs the authorities, including his friend the Prime Minister, who begin an investigation. They determine that whoever is behind this must have corrupted one of the supercomputers, a terrifying prospect to people whose entire civilization is built around those machines.

It is eventually discovered that the rogue AI is Cortland, a surprising choice given that Cortland is one of the most eccentric AIs whose interests run mostly towards ontology. Before they can act on this information their opponent reveals himself. He calls himself Vindex and closes down access to the universes based on Cortland. At the same time he launches a viral zombie plague at Topaz. Aristide is forced to kill Daljit when she becomes infected with the virus and attacks him but she is soon resurrected and along with some others who perished in the plague dedicates herself to the war effort.

Aristide also dedicates himself to the war effort, volunteering to lead part of the coordinated assault against Cortland. Before the assault happens, however, he realizes that Vindex has sabotaged the resurrection machinery. All the people killed in the zombie plague have been resurrected as loyal followers of Vindex, a kind of fifth column. Before he can report his discovery he is killed by Daljit and resurrected as a loyal follower of Vindex himself. However, before he can betray Topaz the problem is discovered by the authorities who incapacitate the victims and reverse Vindex's conditioning.

Aristide goes on to lead an assault on Cortland and watches as all his men are killed. He alone survives and is brought face to face with Vindex. There, the villain reveals his identity. He is in fact Pablo Monagas Perez. His personality had been calved off centuries before to lead the human expedition to Epsilon Eridani. He relates to Aristide the story of how he and a version of Daljit had gone with millions of others to colonize Epsilon Eridani, creating a new world and a supercomputer orbiting the sun.

Along this trip, Pablo and Daljit had fallen deeply in love and Daljit had become more and more interested in exploring the origins of the universe. In doing so she discovered that our universe is, in fact, an artificial construct, just like the pocket universes that humanity created but on a much larger scale. However, before she can fully explore the implications of this shocking discovery Epsilon Eridani undergoes a stellar expansion which is labeled by those in the Sol system as ""The Big Belch"". This expansion destroys the Epsilon Eridani's orbital supercomputer and fries the day side of the artificially constructed world orbiting it.

Hundreds of millions die in the conflagration. Only those on the night side of the planet, such as Pablo, are able to survive and only by hiding in deep bunkers. Most of the survivors opt to head back to Sol, life around Epsilon Eridani no longer being possible, but their ship mysteriously vanishes along the way. Pablo remains to search for Daljit, who he hopes survived. She did not but he becomes obsessed with her work and with the idea of punishing the creators of this universe, whom he calls The Inept, for all the suffering of humanity. Returning to the Sol system, he contacts Cortland, whose interest in ontology allows Pablo to convince the computer to aid him. Pablo explains that he is not attempting to destroy human civilization, but rather to take it over so that everyone will work towards his goal: using a wormhole to travel back to the origins of the universe and punish its creators.

Aristide derides Pablo's plan as madness and is able to escape with the help of Bitsy, who has been living with Pablo since she disappeared. Aristide returns to Topaz where he informs the leadership of Vindex's plans. Before they can pursue any other action the supercomputer Aloysius is destroyed by a 
mass driver
 which Vindex had created in the 
kuiper belt
.

As the other supercomputers adjust their orbits in order to stay out of the line of fire, the authorities desperately attempt to come up with a plan to defeat Vindex. One person comes up with the idea of creating their own mass drivers within pocket universes. These would have the advantage of being undetectable to Vindex until they were actually fired.

Aristide then comes up with the idea of creating a massive pocket universe, dubbed an ""overpocket"" which will encompass the inner solar system, thus cutting Vindex off from his mass driver in the kuiper belt. With the overpocket deployed, the other supercomputers unleash their own mass drivers against Vindex and Cortland, destroying them. The book concludes with Aristide concluding that Vindex's idea of using a wormhole to travel to the beginning of time is a worthy one and that he might attempt to do it with willing allies."

The narrator Joshua—at first appearing to be just over 60 years old, wakes up May 27, 2109 in an apartment on human-settled 
Mars
. With no memory of his past, he goes to his 
werp
, a voice-activated laptop computer, and learns that his name is Joshua Ali Quare and that he was born in 1968. From this 
frame story
 and a box containing several objects from his past, Quare pieces together what he believes is true about his life leading to the early 22nd century. It is soon clear that he is unburdened by any form of 
morality
.

Joshua ran away from home early in his teens to escape his abusive father, and stayed in an upstairs apartment at Gwenny's Diner. Joshua's mother, a 
Communist party
 member, surreptitiously helped him. He entered the US Army at the behest of some Party organizers, and he was put in contact with a 
KGB
 operative who provided him with an injection to keep him from receiving or transmitting AIDS (which mutates into mutAIDS and spreads soon after, wiping out a large percentage of the population of Earth). The injection also enhanced his memory, and periodically regenerates his body, so that he becomes 10 years younger with each 15-year life period. This makes him a 
longtimer
, and gives him the side-effect of having his memory wiped after every life period.

Joshua's US Army career is spent in 
Operation Desert Storm
 (the 
First Oil War
 in the novel) and the ""Second Oil War"" which culminated in a march on 
Tehran
. After the collapse of the 
Soviet Union
, the 
KGB
 diversified and became ""the Organization,"" a counter-insurgency group that supplied technical and logistic support to every side in the Eurowar, a 
NATO
-Central European Union-Russian conflict in the early 21st century. Among the innovations of the Eurowar were 
Simulation Modeling Optimizing Targeters
 (SMOTs) a jump from 
smart weapons
 to ""brilliant weapons"" that attacked an enemy country's natural resources and means of production. These weapons cause massive environmental damage to the earth, and are the predecessors of the 
memes
. Joshua, as an agent for The Organization, begins his violent operative career with a gang rape involving US soldiers, and then sets out a series of terrorist-like missions to intensify the war. During the Eurowar, Joshua raped a woman and killed her and her family (perhaps the only disturbing memory he regrets), murdered many soldiers and civilians, suppressed science and research through rape and torture, and essentially caused mayhem along with other Organization 
longtimers
, for great sums of pay. After the Eurowar ended, Joshua took in ""Alice"", a war orphan from 
Prague
 in an incident where he got the 
dog tag
 – and inspiration for future alias – ""John Childs"".

In the 2010s, the Organization abandoned Joshua, who then joined the 
Reconstruction
 after the Eurowar and worked in 
Quito
, 
Ecuador
 on the 
GeoSync
 Cable and saw with Alice the beginning of the development of 
memes
 that would unify all countries and religions, leading to the War of the Memes (referred to in some of Barnes' other books) that culminated in the takeover of Earth by 
One True
. Alice runs away, and the Organization finds and rehires Joshua to fight in the War of the Memes, for One True. By the time One True consolidated its hold on the people of Earth, Mars, the 
Jupiter
 and 
Saturn
 systems had been colonized for decades. Joshua steals another person's ID and becomes an ecoprospector on Mars.

The best scientists and engineers of free humanity had developed the technology to unleash a 
singularity
 at the edge of the 
Solar System
 that would provide a return point in time and space for the descendants of five transfer ships sent to colonize other nearby star systems. When Joshua finally ventures forth to meet his Organization contact in Red Sands City, he's confronted by a tremendous hustle and bustle of people preparing for the transfer ship descendants to arrive from the 25th century and either destroy One True (and the population on Earth under its control) or confine it there.

A fellow Organization agent named Sadi has been in Joshua's life one way or another since the inception of the Organization. On Mars, Sadi, who's also a longtimer, meets Joshua as a woman, Sadi's original gender, and now gender of choice. This is possible due to the Organization perfecting the regeneration process, now called 'revival', which also gave Sadi complete memory recovery and a permanent 20-year-old body. From Sadi, whom Joshua had met 
as
 a woman after the Eurowar and was partnered with when Sadi was male during the War of the Memes, Joshua learns that it's possible to go through the singularity to 1988, when the technology to construct it was first built and put into orbit by the Soviets. By the time of the novel's frame story, Sadi has done this thirty times, each time changing history to his/her benefit. After Joshua's revival and a time as Sadi's lover, Joshua, who's repeatedly refused to accompany Sadi on these excursions through the singularity, (also known as a 
closed timelike curve
), is sent by her via force on a preset course through the singularity once more. Sadi claims to have brought Joshua back in time with her before, without being revived, so she could 'help' Joshua love her as obsessively as Sadi loves him. Now she wants him to experience the freedom she's had, in hopes of having him come back to her for good. Joshua makes plans when he comes back to the late 20th century to change history himself, many times over, alone."

Transporting a comatose Lucasinho to his father in Meridian, Luna and the Sisters of the Lords of Now are attacked by a Mackenzie Metals security team bent on abducting Lucasinho in his medical pod. They are fought off by Santinho foot-soldiers from João de Deus, but Luna's fleeing spacecraft is downed by chain-gun fire, leaving Luna, Madrinha Elis, and Lucasinho the only survivors. Lucas, having overtaken the Moon with his terrestrial allies, is now the Eagle of the Moon. Lousika tells Lucas that the Asamoahs cannot heal Lucasinho's brain damage, but suggests that the University of Farside can, on the opposite side of the Moon. Lucas's bid in the Court of Clavius for custody of Lucasinho is opposed by his ex-wife Amanda, who is acting on behalf of the Suns. They are both thwarted by Ariel, who outmaneuvers them and has Luna declared Lucasinho's guardian. Biocyberneticists at the university give Ariel the power to walk again using a spinal device.

Alexia, Lucas's Iron Hand, goes into the impoverished upper levels of Meridian and helps the people there build an intricate but illegal system for water collection and filtration. Using the name Lê, she takes their leader, who calls himself ""Jack of Blades"", as her lover. She soon realizes, however, that he is the exiled Denny Mackenzie, who murdered Lucas's brother Carlinhos, and whose grandfather Alexia herself was responsible for killing. Alexia flees the situation for a meeting with the Vorontsovs and their terrestrial allies, who outline the Lunar Bourse, their plan for converting the Moon into an automated energy resource for Earth. Duncan stresses to the Vorontsovs that the remaining Dragon families must work together against the terrestrials. Gender-neutral economist Vidhya Rao, initially a supporter of the Bourse project, begins to become disillusioned with the business model, and learns the plan involves a complete depopulation of the Moon. The Three August Sages are the 
AI
 aspects of a quantum computer which makes startlingly accurate predictions of the future, created for Whitacre Goddard by the Suns. Vidhya is the only human with whom the Sages will communicate, but when e learns that the depopulation effort will utilize deadly plagues, the Three August Sages and Whitacre Goddard attempt to assassinate er. Vidhya is aided in er escape by Madam Sun, an avatar of Lady Sun that exists in the system thanks to a 
backdoor
. Vidhya seeks Ariel's help convincing Lucas to break ties with the terrestrials and oppose the Bourse, but Ariel wants no part of it.

On Earth, Marina is struggling to overcome the Moon's adverse effects to her body, and witnesses first-hand the distrust and hatred the terrestrials have for Moon people. She decides to go back to the Moon, but the Defence Intelligence Agency tries to make her return contingent on her being their spy. Marina's sister Kessie lends her the money she needs for the ticket, and Marina secretly travels to a launch facility in Canada so she can depart before the DIA is able to do anything to stop her.

The Suns accelerate the activation of their Sun Ring, a huge band of solar energy collectors that spans the circumference of the Moon, to undercut the terrestrials by securing a significant share of the Earth's energy market. Duncan and his entourage are killed in the destruction of the Suns' Pavilion of Eternal Light, presumably orchestrated by his absent brother Bryce. Darius and Denny each claim Mackenzie Metals for their own, and a battle between Denny's new Mackenzie jackaroos and Darius's Sun soldiers ends in Denny's victory. Bryce threatens Analiese's family if she does not thwart Wagner and hand over Robson. She complies, but the thugs who take Robson kill her anyway. Wagner seeks help from Lucas, who conspires to assassinate Bryce. Alexia brings Robson's friend Haider to visit him, and Haider slips Robson a set of poisoned needles. Bryce summons Robson with the intent of having sex with the boy, but Robson kills him with the needles, and Lucas retakes João de Deus from the Mackenzies. Ariel serves Lucas with a formal challenge to trial by combat to settle Lucasinho's case. Lucas, in turn, serves a challenge to Amanda. Lucas's champion, or zashitnik, is renowned knife-fighter Mariano Gabriel Demaria, who easily defeats the zashitnik of the Suns, and Amanda's claim is dismissed. Ariel, a lawyer with no combat skills, surprises everyone by stepping in for her own zashitnik. As Ariel hoped, Lucas does the same to keep Mariano from eviscerating his sister. The Cortas break their knives on the fighting floor and move to negotiate. Ariel offers Lucas custody of Lucasinho in exchange for Ariel replacing him as Eagle of the Moon. Lucas agrees, and gives Ariel the codes to control the terrestrials' new combat bots, which he acquired by way of a deal with Amanda.

The Corta entourage, fleeing on a ship with Nik Vorontsov, are pursued by older combat bots immune to Ariel's codes. Luna's ghazi escort Dakota and Ariel's zashitnik Rosario don sasuits and neutralize two dangerous bots sabotaging the ship from out on the hull. Later, Lucas asks Ariel why she wanted to be the Eagle, and she tells him about Vidhya's warning. Ariel has all the terrestrial representatives on the Moon brought to Boa Vista as leverage in her negotiations with Earth. She abolishes the Four Elementals, making air, water, carbon, and data free for everyone on the Moon."

The novel is presented in three basic parts:



Part one
[
edit
]


Introduces the protagonist, paleoanthropologist Dr. Barbara Marchando, her 
African-American
 family history and her heritage. Marchando is visiting her family during Thanksgiving, recovering from a recent, bitter divorce, prompting her to seek time alone to explore an attic. She discovers her ancestor Zebulon's diary which yields an account of the arrival of strange, new animal slaves dying from disease soon after arriving and provides motivation for digging on the grounds of the family's former plantation home. The dig is originally intended to identify the approximate location of a rumored pre-Civil War slave graveyard. A large section of the graveyard is found. A smaller separate section of graves yields skeletal remains that all display the same cranial and other bodily disfigurements.  To the Dr.'s trained eye they resemble skulls known in fossil records as 
Australopithecus
, a human ancestral species that died out some 1,400,000 years before. However, these remains are at most two centuries old. They are classified as an example of the subspecies 
Australopithecus boisei
. The skeletons' classification and confirmed recent dates of death are impossible according to the accepted fossil record. Despite attempts to maintain a low profile, word of the unexpected findings leak to media. Skeptics express disbelief and ridicule the doctor's conclusions, jeopardizing her reputation and career.



Part two
[
edit
]


Research of old town records disclose the sale of a new, heartier type of slave to the former plantation's master. The vessel bringing the 'new type slave' cargo is listed by name through the shipment manifest and its port of origin in Africa is identified. Marchando wins funding to visit the African port city and search for traces of what might have been a small enclave of humans displaying traits of an early human ancestor. After several unsuccessful excursions, a promising lead at last points to a remote, isolated and unfriendly group of villagers as a source of 'worker beasts'. A translator, armed escort, Marchando and several companions make plans to visit the isolated group. Marchando and the translator question the chief about stories of white men coming long ago to buy 'worker beasts' from the village and if they might help find where such 'beasts' lived. After an agreement for information is arranged, a young, dirty, naked and malnourished 
Australopithecus boisei
 female is led by collar and leash into the hut and handed over as purchased property. Aghast, Marchando realizes she has unintentionally traded a few goods and tools for a living fossil. The chief advises that the trade is fair and that most of the village has at least one beast to perform work they avoid. As the translator explains that undoing the exchange with the chief would prove insulting & dangerous, Marchando and her team leave with the nervous, but otherwise docile female. The doctor and team set about making plans to return to the port city and sedate the female while arrangements are made to transition her to Europe and eventually the United States. The female Boisei is given the name ""Thursday"" by Marchando. This is both a reference to the day she was found, and is a literary reference to the character of Friday in 
Robinson Crusoe
.



Part three
[
edit
]


Despite efforts to maintain secrecy, word leaks. Upon reaching a research hospital facility outside 
Washington, D.C.
, and publication of the find, the shock to the scientific community and general public is intense. Marchando and other researchers are successful in teaching Thursday to communicate by 
sign language
. Thursday is soon found capable of reasoning, compassion and understanding abstract ideas like time and family; far beyond any ape's cognition. The question arises, ""what is Thursday""? She obviously is not a 
Homo sapiens
 nor an ape (
Hominidae
). 
Genetic testing
 reveals she is partly 
hybrid
 from past interbreeding of her ancestors and human captors, further confusing her status as a species. Conflicting ideas on her rights emerge. They're seen variously as better substitutes for chimpanzees in 
medical testing
, an easily trained labor force, potentially living 
organ banks
, essentially a future slave race to be considered as beasts or property. Other research centers begin plans to obtain more boisei from Africa, as specimens for study and 
zoos
. As a descendant herself of slaves, Marchando finds this unthinkable. Authorities begin efforts to access and control Thursday in the ""interest of science"", endangering her safety and life. Marchando is desperate to protect Thursday and prove she should be treated as human. She tracks Thursday's 
ovulation
 and secretly conducts an 
artificial insemination
 using sperm frozen years ago by her ex-husband. When Thursday becomes several months pregnant, she ignites a legal and moral firestorm over whether to permit her pregnancy to come full term. Before a legal decision can be reached, Thursday births a healthy, mixed female child resembling both herself and a human biological father, thus demonstrating Thursday's full genetic compatibility with modern humanity.

The novel draws parallels between the conventional thinking of centuries ago that humans from Africa were not truly 
human beings worthy of rights
. The novel's ending is left open for interpretation on what it means to be human and where a line, if any, can be drawn between ourselves and our ancestors."

The novel takes place around the planets Yellowstone and Resurgam, in two story lines which converge near the climax of the novel.



Yellowstone
[
edit
]


The novel begins in the year 2605, where 
Skade
 has been tasked with investigating a Conjoiner ship that has returned to the Conjoiner headquarters, the Mother Nest. Skade is a Conjoiner woman who appears to be in touch with secret circles of control within the theoretically 
egalitarian
 Conjoiners society. In the ship, she discovers 
Galiana
, the original founder of the Conjoiners, who left Conjoiner space decades previously on an exploration mission. In space, Galiana had encountered the 
Inhibitors
, who unleashed an agent into her ships, seized control, and killed her crew. It now controls her mind as well. Galiana requests that Skade kill her, but Skade only places her in 
suspended animation
 in the hope that she can be helped in the future.

Ten years later, 
Nevil Clavain
 is facing problems in the Conjoiner mother nest; he is struggling to find answers about what happened to Galiana, whether she is still alive, and about 
Felka
, who he believes may be his and Galiana's daughter. He ponders these concerns during a mission when he ends up rescuing 
Antoinette Bax
 as she flies her freighter through  the top of the atmosphere of the gas giant Tangerine Dream, to fulfill her promise to her late father to bury him there. Clavain warns her that if he ever sees her again, he'll kill her. Her ship severely damaged, Bax limps back to the Rust Belt, a ring of 
orbital habitats
 around Yellowstone, to rejoin her lover, the ship's mechanic.

When Clavain and Skade return to the Mother Nest, Skade, 
Remontoire
, and Felka convince Clavain to join the Conjoiner's leadership, which Clavain had been resisting. Skade informs him about the threat of the Inhibitors and convinces him to undertake a mission to reclaim a cache of lost Conjoiner doomsday weapons. She shows him the fleet of advanced starships that the Conjoiners have been building in secret. 

Although Skade claims that she will use the weapons and ships to defend humanity against the Inhibitors, Clavain is convinced that they will simply evacuate and abandon the rest of humanity. Clavain defects to the Demarchists at Yellowstone and spreads the news of the Inhibitors, and also enlists Antoinette Bax's help to escape the Conjoiners under Skade who are pursuing him.

Clavain is followed by Scorpio and Remontoire, but they along with Antoinette and Clavain are captured by the mysterious underground figure known as 
""H""
. H reveals what happened to Skade during a Conjoiner raid into Chasm City. This was when Skade discovered the secrets that would lead her to develop inertia suppression technology, and when H believes she was subverted by an alien intellect. Clavain reveals Skade's plans for the Conjoiner fleet and the cache weapons, and H agrees to help him beat Skade to them. H supplies ships and his own version of the inertial suppression technology, while Scorpio supplies an army of 
hyper-pigs
 for the pursuit.

Skade and Clavain race to the Resurgam system by employing various strategies, including inertia suppression that pushes their ships to faster relativistic speeds. Eventually, Skade's vessel is damaged in an attempt to  use an advanced technology to exceed the speed of light, and she witnesses the death of a crew member trapped in a collapsing bubble.



Resurgam
[
edit
]


Several years later (roughly 50 from the start of the events in the book), 
Triumvir Ilia Volyova
 and 
Ana Khouri
 are on the planet Resurgam and have discovered a new threat to life: the Inhibitors. Alerted to the presence of humanity during events described in 
Revelation Space
, these swarms of intelligent machines have begun dismantling several rocky moons across the system and are moving their components towards the gas giant, Roc. Volyova and Khouri resolve to evacuate the population of Resurgam, 200,000 people, by posing as government agents to enlist the rebel Thorn in their cause, since he has been attempting to evacuate Resurgam all along. They must also open communications with Captain 
John Brannigan
 who is in direct control of their ship, the 
Nostalgia for Infinity
, since his mind and body have fused with the ship's systems, due to the 
nanotechnological
 Melding Plague. Volyova tries speaking to the Captain to grant her control of the cache weapons as the last resort against the Inhibitors. (These are the same weapons that Clavain is sent to recover for the Conjoiners. During the events in the novel 
Revelation Space
, Volyova activates the weapons, which allows the Conjoiners in Yellowstone to determine their location.) Volyova persuades Captain Brannigan  to let the people evacuate onto the ship, as an ark, that could redeem his past transgressions.

In space, Clavain and Scorpio board Skade's ship to save Felka. Clavain and Scorpio plant explosives as a contingency. After finding Felka but failing to liberate Galiana, they depart and watch Skade's ship explode from a far distance, as Clavain mourns his loss of Galiana.

On Resurgam, Volyova, Khouri, and Thorn begin the lengthy evacuation and preparation of their ship, while the Inhibitors continue their mysterious construction project, suspected to target the system's star. Only a few thousand people are evacuated when the Inhibitors approach Resurgam's star so closely that Volyova scrambles to deploy the cache weapons, in the hope to buy more time. A beta-level simulation of Clavain arrives as data in a laser transmission, and negotiates with Volyova to turn over the cache weapons to him when he arrives on the ship 
Zodiacal Light
. Volyova rejects his persuasive arguments and explains that her need for the weapons is greater than his, so she returns to work on deploying them.

When 
Zodiacal Light
 arrives in the system, and because of the failure of his beta-level to negotiate a handover from Volyova, Clavain attacks 
Nostalgia for Infinity
 and uses Scorpio and his loyal hyper-pigs as a boarding party. Clavain's superior force captures 
Nostalgia for Infinity
, although Volyova is able to damage 
Zodiacal Light
 with one of the cache weapons. The two sides negotiate terms, with Clavain and his crew taking command of Volyova's ship. 

They evacuate the colonists more quickly with the help of Antoinette Bax' freighter, 
Storm Bird
. Clavain finds Volyova dying from injuries she sustained when Captain Brannigan attempted to commit suicide by turning a cache weapon against the ship. Volyova makes a final deal with Clavain to take half of the remaining cache weapons and 
Storm Bird
 to mount a last-ditch attack on the Inhibitors. Bax bids a teary farewell to the mysterious beta-level simulation that has operated 
Storm Bird
 and watched over her, as he says he may find redemption in his last mission with Volyova.

The Inhibitors use their alien technology, built from the matter harvested from the gas giant, Roc, to pierce the layers of Resurgam's star and expose its nuclear fusion core. The radiation energy blasts Resurgam, destroys all its life, and reduces it to a cinder.

Later, Clavain learns Volyova's final attack had no effect. He discovers that Skade narrowly survived their space battle. Clavain reaffirms his goal to return the cache weapons to humanity, since they are their creators and true owners. Skade vows to pursue him and seek vengeance for his defection.

Remontoire and Khouri remain in the system aboard the 
Zodiacal Light
 to contact 
Dan Sylveste
 in the Hades Matrix (seen in the final events of 
Revelation Space
) in the hopes that he may provide knowledge they can use to fight the Inhibitors.

The novel ends as 
Nostalgia for Infinity
 lands vertically in the seawater of on an unnamed Pattern Juggler planet, where the crew and rescued people of Resurgam, all except 40,000, establish a new colony (in the following novel of the series 
Absolution Gap
, the planet is called Ararat). However, the crew is unsure why the Captain/ship chose that planet as a destination. Clavain estimates they'll need about 20 years to wait for the 
Zodiacal Light
 to catch up with them so they can resume the fight against the Inhibitors. 

Felka reveals her true relationship to Clavain and how his lover Galiana visited this planet hundreds of years ago, where she may have uploaded her mind into the Pattern Jugglers in the ocean. Felka believes Galiana somehow planted the location of the planet without revealing it to the Inhibitors. Clavain and Felka walk toward the shore with renewed hope.



Inhibitor Asides
[
edit
]


In addition to the two plot lines there are occasional asides explaining the history and motivation of the Inhibitors. These asides explain the galaxy was once filled with star-faring civilizations. Those civilizations were largely destroyed in the ""Dawn War"", a galaxy-wide conflict over the galaxy's scarce resources. One of these civilizations determines that a collision between our galaxy and another will occur in 3 billion years and create/become the Inhibitors in order to shepherd intelligent life through this cataclysm. They had determined that collision could be most easily dealt with if intelligent life was kept isolated to individual star systems, leaving the Inhibitors to perform any necessary manipulations of stars and planets to reduce the damage caused by the collision.

The asides also reveal that the Inhibitors were not as brutal in their past, but their performance has degraded over the millennia. They have been detecting civilizations at later stages, and required to commit wholesale extinction more often.

Clavain and Felka learn of this history during communication with the Inhibitors in Galiana's head. Clavain, however, is not convinced that the Inhibitors are right about the coming catastrophe and believes that their degrading performance may give humanity a chance for survival that other species have not had. As such, he rejects the Inhibitor requests to stand down.

The 
future collision of our galaxy with the Andromeda Galaxy
 is a scientifically predicted event.
[

]
 However, astronomers believe that it would not cause major damage to the capability of the galaxy to support life because galaxies are so diffuse that very few, if any, planets and stars would collide.

The story is told from a first person perspective of the narrator recounting a tale from an old friend of his, Tom Flanagan, whom he runs into years after the events of the story, in a nightclub.

Years ago, Tom and another boy named Del Nightingale attend the prestigious all boys private school Carson. The freshmen run afoul of senior Steve “Skeleton” Ridpath, an antisocial psychopath. Steve and Tom both have vivid nightmares of a strange figure watching them and of a vulture hovering over them, which seem to oddly connect to Del’s childhood. Del expresses his love of magic to Tom, getting him hooked on as well, showing an expertise in the craft.

At an away football game, Skeleton steals an expensive artifact from the other school, leading to the Carson students to be subjected to extensive and intense interrogation by the principal. It’s revealed that Skeleton kept the item, alongside several papers, inside the piano bench, explaining his anger towards anyone who got near it. Del discovers the artifact and destroys it, but doesn’t reveal Skeleton stole it to the staff, and the situation is mostly forgotten.

Del and Tom perform a magic show for the school. At the end of their act, the auditorium catches fire, killing one student. The freshmen wonder where Skeleton was during the fire, and grieve the death of the student, fellow freshmen Dave Brick. In the summer, Tom discovers his father has died from cancer, and is invited to stay with Del at his uncles estate, Shadowland, for the summer. Feeling a need to protect Del, Tom agrees to go. On the train ride to Vermont, Del explains that his uncle was a renowned magician who taught Del real magic and wants to teach Tom as well. Del also reveals that he controlled Skeleton to steal the artifact, hoping it would suspend Skeleton but the plan evidently did not work. Tom  stumbles on a train compartment that did not exist before, and runs into Skeleton who disappears shortly thereafter. The train is delayed by a crash, but Tom and Del make it safely, albeit hours late.

Arriving in Vermont, Tom meets Del’s uncle, Coleman Collins, an evident alcoholic. Collins introduces Tom to Shadowland, and prepares them for the summer. As Collins performs trickery on the boys, warping their sense of time and space, he recounts his past as a 
World War I
 soldier and nurse and how he acquired his magical persona. Tom seems to run into Collins randomly around Shadowland, who disturbs Tom with cryptic messages about Tom’s future as the “King of the Cats.” Del becomes jealous of Tom as Del is isolated from everyone, but the two reconcile as Tom schemes to make Del the future ruler of Shadowland, not wanting the position to be handed to him.

Also in Shadowland are the Wandering Boys, a group of burly men who acted as Collins’ bodyguards during the War, and Rose Armstrong, a mysterious fifteen year old who stays on the lake. Rose confides to Tom that Collins is manipulating the boys against each other and she wishes to escape to rescue the two of them. The two begin to fall in love with each other, meeting up at night to discuss ways to escape and express their love. Over time Tom is able to convince Del that Collins is psychopathic.

Collins finishes the tale of his past to Tom and Del. As a medic, Collins was forced to mercy kill a fellow soldier who was grievously injured. Believing he had become the man he murdered, Collins suffered from multiple personality disorder, and ran away from the war to perform in magic shows around Europe. While traveling he was invited by Speckle John, another magician, to join his group, and began dating Rosa Forte, and hired the Wandering Boys, becoming a massively successful group. Collins also mastered an entity known as the Collector, a receptacle that Collins used to murder any competitors after possessing them. After catching Speckle John making love to Rosa Forte, Collins left the group after taking away Speckle John’s powers. Tom realizes Collins is grooming him to become Collins successor.

Rose guides Tom and Del to an underground tunnel system that leads them out of Shadowland. While walking, they are spotted and chased by the Wandering Boys. Rose tricks the boys by taking them back to Collins manor. Collins decides to start his final performance early, crucifying Tom in the main stage and letting the Wandering Boys mercilessly beat Del. Tom awakens and meets the spirit of Speckle John, who was reincarnated as Del’s butler, who mentally pushes Tom to escape. Tom shoots and kills some of the Wandering Boys, and rescues Del from the rest of them. They are joined by Rose, a reincarnation of Rosa Forte, who admits that Collins manipulated her as well as she believed leading them back would save them. The three prepare to face off against Collins.

The Collector, possessing Skeleton, arrives and pursues the trio. Del is kidnapped by Collins, Rose runs away and hides and Tom is momentarily killed by the Collector. Tom is able to rip Skeleton from the Collector and lets him walk away alive. Tom and Rose barge into Collins room. He expresses disappointment in Tom, deeming him a failure, and turns Del into a bird before disappearing. Tom follows Collins around the manor before he kills Del by turning him into stone. The two fight, with Tom trapping Collins inside the Collector and sending him away. Tom burns the house down and leaves with Rose, where they sleep on the lakeshore before she disappears in the morning, inferring that Rose is a mermaid. Tom sets the statue of Del on the lake before leaving Shadowland.

In the present, after interviewing others that Tom Flanagan knew, the narrator meets an older Skeleton at a monastery who seems to have no recollection of the events of the story. The narrator visits the town where Shadowland resides in and visits to find nothing, but stumbles on a brick, realizing that the estate has fully burned down, confirming Tom’s story."

Harry Dresden
, still living on the island of Demonreach, is unable to reach his allies and plagued by increasing headaches due to a parasitic spirit growing in his mind. 
Queen Mab
 demands he undertake a job, but in return offers her aid with the parasite. Harry is to help 
Nicodemus
 steal something from the vault of 
Hades
. Wary of the potential for betrayal, he enlists the aid of 
Karrin Murphy
 to watch his back.

Harry and Karrin meet Nicodemus and his crew, which includes Binder and a female warlock, Hanna Ascher, and soon 
Anna Valmont
, the only surviving member of the group of thieves who had stolen the 
Shroud of Turin
 in 
Death Masks
. Harry accompanies Nicodemus's daughter Deirdre and the shape-shifting Goodman Grey to collect a sample from an insider, Harvey Morrison, who is quickly killed when 
Tessa
 unexpectedly intervenes. Dresden learns that the heist's target is the 
Holy Grail
. At the third meeting, they realize that they are being spied upon by 
Waldo Butters
. Giving chase, Harry manages to keep Binder's henchmen from catching him with the help of 
Bob
. Nicodemus catches up with Dresden, Murphy and Butters on the street in front of 
Michael Carpenter
's house, and a fight ensues. Murphy draws Fidelacchius and is tricked into using the sword to 
attempt to kill Nicodemus while defenseless
, which results in the sword's shattering and Murphy being badly wounded. Michael then appears, offering to leave his angel-protected house in exchange for the release of Harry, Karrin and Butters. Nicodemus accepts the deal, but before Michael leaves, 
Uriel
 appears, giving Michael Amoracchius and his own Grace so that Michael can fight effectively. Nicodemus surrenders the fight and agrees to accept Michael as Harry's replacement for the wounded Murphy. That night while recovering at the Carpenters', Harry reconnects with his daughter Maggie for the first time since he saved her life at 
Chichen Itza
 in 
Changes
.

As the heist begins, the group breaks into a high security vault owned by 
John Marcone
, where Dresden opens a Way to Hades' vault in the Nevernever. Ascher and Dresden open the Gates of Fire and Ice respectively, and Deirdre willingly allows Nicodemus to kill her so that her spirit can open the final Gate of Blood. Once inside the vault, Dresden and Valmont find an altar holding not only the Grail, but four other artifacts associated with the 
crucifixion of Jesus
. Harry realizes that the vault is actually an armory, and Hades stops time to discuss the situation privately with him. Hades uses the vault to store powerful artifacts and weapons until those with the knowledge and power to wield them properly can claim them.

Armed with this knowledge, Dresden hides three artifacts in Valmont's bag and one in his sleeve before Nicodemus and the others arrive to claim the Grail. Nicodemus takes the Grail but turns on Harry and Michael after Harry angrily calls him out on murdering his own daughter for his schemes, as Valmont has gone back to the vault's entrance. Ascher and the Genoskwa (an aggressive Bigfoot) are revealed to be the new hosts for the fallen angels Lasciel and Ursiel, respectively. Nicodemus orders them and Grey to attack, breaking his agreement with Mab and leaving Harry free to act as he sees fit.

It is then revealed through a flashback that Harry had earlier hired Grey to back him up in anticipation of this fight. Grey takes on the Genoskwa/Ursiel, Dresden fights Ascher/Lasciel, and Michael fights Nicodemus after making a final appeal to his humanity. After Dresden manages to bury Ascher in a rockfall and Michael sends Nicodemus running, Grey blinds the Genoskwa, allowing the three of them to escape. On the way out, Dresden activates the Gate of Ice to crush the pursuing Genoskwa.

Dresden opens a Way and the four of them depart the Nevernever, but before they can close the Way, Nicodemus escapes and heads for Michael's house, trapping the others in Marcone's vault. The team escapes with help from Binder, and Harry and Grey hurry to confront Nicodemus at Michael's home. During the final fight, Butters takes up the broken Fidelacchius, which emits a 
lightsaber
-style blade, and chases off Nicodemus again. He agrees to become a Knight of the Cross. Molly Carpenter, Michael's daughter and Harry's former apprentice, now the new Winter Lady, arrives in time to safely remove the parasitic spirit from Harry's head.

Afterwards, the group divide up a backpack full of diamonds Valmont stole from Hades' vault. Grey turns down a share of them, instead accepting one dollar from Harry as his fee, and Harry uses that share as a 
weregild
 to pay for the death of Marcone's vault guard. He deduces that Mab, Hades, and Marcone conspired to let Nicodemus carry out the heist in order to destroy his reputation, as revenge for his earlier kidnapping of Marcone and the Archive, and confronts Mab and Marcone with his conclusions. He then visits Karrin in the hospital and the two share a passionate kiss and agree to try an actual relationship. Talking with Michael that evening, Harry reflects over the events of the past few days, and together they worry about a few things including Harry's future as the Winter Knight."

The protagonist, Matthew Fuller, is a research assistant for physics professor Jonathan Marsh at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in 2057, when he builds a 
calibrator
 to supply one photon per unit of time. When he presses the reset button, the box unexpectedly disappears for one second. When he presses the button a second time, he finds it disappears for about 10 seconds. The third time, it disappears for a bit less than three minutes. Fuller deduces it is traveling forward in time at intervals approximately 11.8 times the previous interval and he further deduces how to bring other objects, such as himself, along. On the seventh press of the button, Fuller and the box are taken 39 days into the future and unexpectedly land on a busy road. He is arrested on suspicion of murder but is 
bailed
 out of jail by an anonymous person he comes to believe is himself from the future. He continues forward, 465 days, then 15 years, when he is greeted by Professor Marsh who tracked Fuller and calculated the theoretical physics behind time travel (and won a

 for it).

Unsatisfied, Matt travels to 2252 where he learns that the Second Coming of Jesus has occurred and resulted in the One Year War. Society is now governed by a

Matt and Martha begin to receive messages in their dreams from beings that appear to Matt as future versions of himself and to Martha as 
Jesus
. He/they warn Matt and Martha of La's willingness to sacrifice their lives in pursuit of her goal, and advises them to stall for time to allow them to catch up. Matt and Martha, accompanied by La in a spacecraft, begin to travel further into the future, discovering evermore unfamiliar species of life, including 
androgynous
 evolutions of humanity and a race of intelligent 
bears
. Time travelers are not always welcome - some future societies having been devastated by diseases brought from the past by such travelers for which future humans had no immunity, and therefore regard them as a dangerous threat.

After a confrontation where they narrowly avoid being killed by La, they meet the people who have been sending them subliminal messages. These beings tell Matt and Martha that the future becomes ever more alien and unpleasant, and offer to send the two back in time, while allowing La to continue jumping forward in time.  The beings can specify either the exact time or the exact location to which Matt and Martha will be sent, but not both (this limitation is similar to the 
uncertainty principle
).  Concerned about the couple possibly materializing in the middle of the ocean or inside of a mountain, they opt to be specific about location and send them to MIT.

When they arrive, they find that it is the late 19th century, and the main MIT campus in 
Cambridge
 has not yet been built.  Having no other option, they live in this society, where Matt studies and teaches physics, aided significantly by his advanced knowledge both of physics and historical events. However, he takes care not to change history – for example, he does not anticipate 
Albert Einstein
 in ""discovering"" the 
theory of relativity
, as he could have easily done; rather, he takes care to appear a talented but not outstanding professor.  Matt and Martha have several children, and the end of the book reveals that Professor Marsh (Matt's MIT professor in the mid-21st century) is actually Matt's descendant.

In 1801 the British have risen to power in 
Egypt
 and suppress the worship of the old 
Egyptian gods
. A 
cabal
 of 
magicians
 plan to drive the British out of Egypt by bringing the gods forward in time from an age when they were still powerful and unleashing them on London, thereby destroying the 
British Empire
. In 1802, a failed attempt by the magicians to summon 
Anubis
 opens magical gates in a predictable pattern across time and space.

In 1983, ailing millionaire J. Cochran Darrow has discovered the gates and found that they make 
time travel
 possible. Darrow organizes a trip to the past for fellow millionaires to attend a lecture by 
Samuel Taylor Coleridge
 in 1810. He hires Professor Brendan Doyle to attend and give expert commentary. One of the magicians, Doctor Romany, happens to spy the time travelers and kidnaps Doyle before he can return. Doyle manages to escape torture and flees back to London, now trapped in the 19th century.

Doyle joins a beggars' guild and meets a beggar named Jacky. He plans to meet and befriend 
William Ashbless
, a wealthy poet that Doyle has studied profusely, in order to gain a benefactor. Doctor Romany scours the city for Doyle with his legion of murderous beggars, led by the clown-magician Horrabin. At the same time, Doyle discovers that Darrow has remained in the 19th century to search for Dog-Face Joe, a body-swapping 
werewolf
, in hopes of bribing Joe into granting him a healthy new body. Doyle himself becomes targeted by Joe, receiving the poisoned body of Darrow's former bodyguard, but manages to cure himself of the poison.

In his new body, Doyle realizes that he himself is the historical Ashbless. He copies down Ashbless's poetry from memory and deduces his own future from his study of Ashbless's life. Using this knowledge, he continues to thwart the magicians' plans. After Romany discovers a gate to 1684, Doyle follows him through and stops his attempt to change the past. Meanwhile, Darrow successfully contacts Dog-Face Joe and organizes a deal in which Joe will provide Darrow with healthy bodies and allow him to live forever.

Doyle eventually returns to 1810, but is kidnapped and taken to 
Muhammad Ali's
 Egypt, where the magicians' Master tempts him with resurrecting his dead wife if he will tell them the secrets of the time-gates. Doyle resists and kills the Master. Meanwhile, Jacky discovers Darrow's secret and kills him along with Dog-Face Joe. Doyle returns to London, where the last magician, Romanelli, kidnaps him, Jacky, and Coleridge. In a drugged stupor, Coleridge frees Horrabin's twisted menagerie of monsters, allowing him and Jacky to escape. Romanelli escapes with Doyle to the underworld, but is eaten by 
Apep
 while Doyle is rejuvenated on board the sunboat of the god 
Ra
. Doyle meets back up with Jacky and discovers that not only is Jacky secretly a woman, she is his future wife.

Decades later, after living out Ashbless's entire life and becoming a widower, Doyle goes out to meet his historic date with death. Doyle discovers that his intended murderer is a duplicate of himself that the Master had made in Egypt decades before. Doyle kills the duplicate, thereby supplying the corpse for his death, and boats away into an unknown future."

The novel opens with the arrival of an evil entity countless years before the dawn of humanity and life as it is known on earth. It eventually manages to meet and coerce a human boy to serve it, with the goal of eventually returning to its true strength.

Decades later, graduate student and adjunct professor Jeremy Freirs decides to rent a renovated chicken coop located in the New Jersey countryside. The property sits on the farm of Sarr Poroth, who along with his wife Deborah, belong to a restrictive and conservative religious sect that prides itself on eschewing modern conveniences and the modern world as a whole. Prior to traveling to the farm Jeremy meets Carol, a library assistant and failed 
novitiate
 to whom he is drawn. While they believe their meetings to be random coincidence, in truth they were orchestrated by the elderly Mr. Rosebottom, the human boy from so long ago.

Rosebottom's goal is to guide Carol through a series of rituals preparing her for a final one to be held on 
Lammas
, using her naiveté to ensure that she is unaware of her participation. This final ritual will use Carol's body to birth the evil entity. Jeremy is to be killed and reanimated by the entity so it can serve as its own ""father"". While Rosebottom is busy in the city with Carol, a remnant of the entity manages to possess one of the Poroth's cats and eventually Deborah herself, in the process killing its hosts. As the rituals continue the arcane magic results in dramatic environmental changes in New Jersey and New York, as well as disturbances in the Poroth's religious community and the formation of a suspected volcano in an area close to the Poroth farm. This causes the community to believe that Jeremy's presence is the cause.

On the night of the ceremony Rosebottom arrives with Carol to the Poroth farm. It works with Rosebottom to prepare the volcanic hill for the ritual, however they fail to obtain Jeremy as a host. The entity instead possesses Sarr, discarding Deborah's body in a wasp-filled shed, unintentionally trapping the insects. It also manages to abscond with Carol, after drugging both her and Jeremy and tying them up. As the community arrives to force Jeremy to leave, Rosebottom hides in the shed, unaware that it is full of angry wasps, and is stung to death. The angry religious members arrive and discover Jeremy, unconscious and tied up. When he comes to, Jeremy realizes where the entity has taken Carol and manages to arrive just as the ceremony is in progress but has not been completed. He manages to defeat the entity; however, a remnant of it escapes.

The book ends with Jeremy and Carol walking through New York City. The pair are now married and while the ceremony was seemingly unsuccessful, Jeremy briefly worries that the entity is still out there."

 Montgomery.

By 1877, Moreau's financial situation is precarious. The hacienda's owner, Hernando Izalde, is losing faith that Moreau's research is a good investment. Hernando's son Eduardo visits Yaxaktun with his cousin Isidro. After a brief courtship, Eduardo proposes to Carlota. Moreau approves, hoping that this will secure his finances. Isidro disapproves, and sends Montgomery to tell Hernando.

Hernando arrives to prevent the marriage. Carlota strikes Hernando; she grows claws and hisses at him. Hernando fires Moreau and tells him to vacate the hacienda. Montgomery forces the three Izalde men to leave at gunpoint, but they promise to return with more men. Moreau reveals that Carlota is a hybrid. She does not truly need her weekly injections; he has been drugging her in order to keep her docile and to keep her jaguar traits submerged. Carlota angrily shoves Moreau, injuring him.

Carlota releases the hybrids; most of them choose to seek shelter with nearby Mayan rebels. The Izaldes return. Eduardo promises that he will still take Carlota as his mistress, but she rejects him. Montgomery and Lupe assist the other hybrids in escaping, then return for a final confrontation. Isidro, Dr. Moreau, and Hernando are all killed. In her anger, Carlota's jaguar traits emerge; she and Montgomery work together to kill Eduardo.

It is 1345, and in the English town of Ansby (in northeastern 
Lincolnshire
), Sir Roger, Baron de Tourneville, is recruiting a military force to assist king 
Edward III
 in the 
Hundred Years' War
 against France. Suddenly, an enormous silver spacecraft lands outside the town. It is a scouting craft for the Wersgorix Empire, a brutal dominion light years from the 
Solar System
. The Wersgorix hope to take over Earth and are testing the feasibility of colonization. However, the aliens, having forgotten 
hand-to-hand combat
 since it was made obsolete by their advanced technology, are caught off-guard by the angered Englishmen, who mistake the craft for a French trick. The villagers and soldiers in Ansby storm the craft and kill all but one Wersgor, Branithar.

Sir Roger formulates a plan that with the captured ship, he can take the entire village to France to win the war, and then 
liberate the Holy Land
. The townspeople, with all of their belongings, board the ship at the baron's instruction, and prepare to take off. The people of Ansby are mystified at the advanced technology aboard the ship, which they come to call the 
Crusader
. Being unable to pilot the 
Crusader
 Sir Roger directs the surly Branithar to pilot them to France. Instead, the alien wrecks the baron's plan by throwing the 
Crusader
 into autopilot on course to Tharixan, another Wersgor colony.

The 
Crusader
 arrives at Tharixan in days, and Sir Roger learns of this new world: it is sparsely-populated, with only three fortresses, Ganturath, Stularax, and Darova (the chief base). The humans capture Ganturath but destroy the 
Crusader
 in the process. Word spreads of the invaders and a meeting is arranged between Sir Roger and his soldiers and the chief of Tharixan, Huruga.

The humans and Wersgor hold talks that do very little to give either side any advantage, but a truce is agreed to. Sir Roger, in order to intimidate the aliens, makes up 
tall tales
 about his estate, ""which only took up three planets"" and his other accomplishments, including a very successful conquest of 
Constantinople
. Sir Roger demands that the entire Wersgorix state submit to the king of England. During the talks, Baron de Tourneville ignores the truce, and orders the capture of the 
fortress
 of Stularax. Unfortunately, the entire base is obliterated by an 
atomic bomb
. In retaliation, Huruga attacks Ganturath again, but loses. He is forced to give up.

Now comes Sir Roger's most outrageous plan; having captured Tharixan, he sets out to overthrow the Wersgorix Empire itself. He enlists the help of three other races oppressed by the Wersgor: the Jairs, the Ashenkoghli, and the Prʔ*tans.

Meanwhile, one of his main soldiers and friend, Sir Owain Montbelle, hatches a plan to return to Earth, something that Sir Roger has lost interest in. With Lady Catherine, Sir Roger's wife, Montbelle corners the baron and demands that he help the people of Ansby get back to Earth. De Tourneville gives in, but attacks Sir Owain in person. At the climax, Lady Catherine betrays Montbelle and kills him herself. Unfortunately, she also destroys the notes that could have helped get the villagers of Ansby back home.

Sir Roger goes on to topple the Wersgor Empire and build one for himself. He manages with the help of not only the species under the Wersgor, but from members of the Wersgor race who rebelled against their government. The religious figures in the story go on to establish a new branch of the Roman Catholic Church.

There is, in the epilogue, a reference to events on Earth since 1345. The captain of the Earth ship is described as being a loyal subject of an Israeli empire. It also appears that Huruga wound up as an archbishop."

Daniel repeatedly encounters alternate versions of himself, sometimes known as Don, and enjoys his own company, ultimately having sex with himself and beginning a relationship with himself. He learns that the changes he has made to his timeline have erased all traces of his childhood and early life.

Though Daniel has been able to become closer to himself than he has in any other relationship, at some point he comes to find that he no longer meets other versions of himself. Lonely and hoping to correct the situation, he jumps many millennia backwards in time, where his jumps have not altered the timeline, and there he meets a female version of himself called ""Diane"". Diane's future is a mirror of Daniel's—she was given the Time-belt by her Aunt Jane, and she had also begun a relationship with her other selves, called Donna. Daniel begins a relationship with Diane and Diane becomes

Daniel and Diane each secretly desire a son and a daughter, respectively, and unbeknownst to each other each uses technology from the future to make their own changes to ensure that Diane gives birth to a child with the desired gender. Shortly after the birth of their child, Daniel and Diane separate.

Daniel raises his son in 1950s America. As Daniel ages, he misses the relationship he had with Diane, but the interference of an obsessive, deranged version of himself has erased the point in the past where the two can meet.

At one point late in the party an elderly version of Daniel dies after a jump, and Daniel is consumed with the thought of his own inevitable death.

Daniel eventually realizes that he has now become his Uncle Jim, and that his son will grow up to be the young version of himself who will inherit the Time-belt, and that his life has ""come full circle."" He makes preparations for after his death to ensure that the young Daniel experiences the same events that Daniel did and has his own experiences with time travel.

Premise

The Empire of Khanum is surrounded by a sea wall. Each wet season, leviathans emerge from the deep ocean and are turned back by imperial weaponry. Imperial citizens live in constant fear of a breach in the walls.

The administrative branch of the Empire includes factions called Iyalets; these include the Iudex (investigators), Legion (armed forces), Engineers (infrastructure), and Apothetikals (botanical modification). Apothetikals use leviathan-derived technology to modify both plants and humans, giving them special powers. Humans who have received apothetikal modifications are called sublimes. Several types of sublimes include engravers (who have perfect memory), axioms (who have incredible mathematical skills), and cracklers (who have enhanced physical strength).

The Empire is divided into various 
cantons
. Years before the start of the story, the canton of Oypat was overrun by a modified plant known as dappleglass. Despite the efforts of the apothetikals, no cure for dappleglass infestation was found. The entire canton was sealed off, and its citizens were evacuated to other regions.



Plot
[
edit
]


Dinios Kol, “Din”, is an engraver. He is chosen as the apprentice to Iudex investigator Anagosa Dolabra, “Ana”. The corpse of engineer Taqtasa Blas is found in a mansion owned by the wealthy Haza family. Din is sent to investigate. Blas was poisoned with dappleglass, which caused plant matter to grow instantaneously through his body. Meanwhile, a leviathan breaches the sea wall. Ana and Din learn that the engineers responsible for the wall were killed in the same manner as Blas.

Ana and Din are sent to the canton of Talagray to continue their investigation. There, they are assisted by several imperial citizens. These include Kepheus Strovi, a Legion captain with whom Din eventually begins a romance; Tuwey Uhad, an engraver; Tazi Miljin, a war hero; Ionia Nusis, an apothetikal, and Valiki Kalista, an engineer.

Din learns that all of the dead engineers were part of a secret group. Additionally, there is one missing engineer whose body was not found: Commander Jolgalgan was a survivor of Oypat, the canton which was once destroyed by dappleglass. As Ana and Din track people with connections to the dead engineers, they find more bodies. These corpses include Blas's secretary and a merchant who sold supplies to the Haza family. Ana deduces that at least two killers are involved. The first poisons people with dappleglass; the second is a sublime who kills with a sharp object to the skull.

Fayazi Haza, a daughter of the family, informs Ana that her father Kaygi Haza was murdered at his home on the night of a party. Kaygi was also killed by dappleglass. Din investigates the estate, where he finds dappleglass in the water tank. Dappleglass is triggered by water and heat, making the bathroom an ideal place for poisoning. Din realizes that the ten dead engineers were also present on the night of the party. They were all secretly receiving patronage from the Haza family. Din and the investigators later find Jolgalgan’s body; she was killed by dappleglass when her lab malfunctioned. Finally, Nusis is killed with a blow to the skull.

Ana brings Fayazi Haza to the office of the Iudex. There, she reveals her theory of the case. Jolgalgan kill Blas. She then infiltrated the party at the Haza estate and poisoned the bathwater, eventually killing Kaygi Haza. While Kaygi was in the bath, he drink from a ewer, infecting it with dappleglass spores. During the patronage meeting later that evening, all ten engineers drank from the same ewer, contracting the contagion from the cup and eventually leading to their deaths. Their deaths and the subsequent breach in the sea wall were never intended. Jolgalgan sought revenge against Blas and the Hazas for the destruction of Oypat. The Empire could have saved the canton, but the powerful Haza family blocked production of a cure as part of an economic plan to drive up the value of their own estates.

Fayazi’s axiom is revealed to be a fraud; she is actually a twitch, a sublime with incredible speed and strength. The twitch killed the secretary, the merchant, and Nusis. Ana kills the twitch with dappleglass. Ana reveals that Jolgangan was not the main perpetrator, but rather was an accomplice to the engraver Uhad. Uhad was present at the Haza mansion on the night of Kaygi's murder; he provided a distraction which allowed her to poison the water tank. Uhad has been a long-term servant of the Empire. He was motivated by a desire to combat the corruption of the gentry who allowed the destruction of an entire canton for monetary reasons.

Din is promoted to become a full assistant investigator. He spends time with Strovi in Talagray before he and Ana are sent on their next investigation."

Touraine discovers that her birth mother, Jaghotai, is a leader of the rebellion. Other rebellion leaders include Djasha, an apostate priest who has lost her magic, and her wife Aranen, a healer.

Luca agrees to give the rebels guns as part of negotiations. Worried that the Sands will bear the brunt of any violence, Touraine betrays Luca to the Balladairan military leader, General Cantic. This leads to a violent uprising and a collapse of negotiations. Touraine joins the rebellion; Luca believes she has been killed in the chaos. The rebels ally with a desert tribe known as the Many-Legged, who use animal magic. Together, they create famine and plague, hoping to drive the Balladairans from their city. Tensions in El-Wast rise due to food shortages and violence. Almost a quarter of the Balladairan forces die from plague.

The rebels invade the Balladairan Quartier, hoping to free the Sands. Touraine and the rebels confront General Cantic. Djasha is killed, Touraine is captured, and the rebels are defeated. As Touraine is about to be executed by 
firing squad
, she gains access to Shālan magic. Aranen escapes and kills Cantic. Luca agrees to leave Qazāl in exchange for the Balladairans’ safety. Touraine stays to help rebuild El-Wast."

The Vampire Tapestry
 is composed of five free-standing novella-length chapters which are stitched together to form one episodic plot, or hence the name, 
tapestry
. In the first half of the novel, the narrative is presented from the point of view of different characters as their paths cross Weyland's. In the final chapters, the focus centers on Weyland himself.



The ancient mind at work
[
edit
]


In the opening chapter of the novel, the narrative follows a woman by the name of Katje de Groot who happens to work at the same college, the Cayslin Center for the Study of Man, where Dr. Weyland is a professor. One late night, Katje observes what she fantasizes to be a vampire fleeing from the scene of a feeding session. Although she comes to the conclusion that what really happened was nothing more than an 
anthropologist
, Dr. Weyland, leaving the lab with one of his sleep subjects, her imagination begins to run wild.

When Dr. Weyland gives a public lecture on ""The Demonology of Dreams,"" Katje naturally decides to attend. During the lecture, the subject of vampirism gets brought up by the audience. From the back of the lecture hall, Katje watches in astonishment as Dr. Weyland provides uncanny insight into how vampires might actually look and behave. For example, they might utilize a needle in their tongue to extract blood rather than having the more conspicuous 
canine
 fangs (page 37).

The next day, Katje compliments Weyland on his lecture. He returns the compliment by inviting her to participate in his sleep study. Initially, she refuses the offer but eventually reconsiders. When she reaches the lab, however, Weyland forces Katje back to his car. While trying to escape from Weyland, Katje manages to shoot him twice. The chapter ends with Weyland driving off into the distance.



The land of lost content
[
edit
]


The second chapter begins with a pair of bystanders finding Weyland collapsed at the wheel of his 
Mercedes-Benz
. When Weyland refuses the men's offer to alert the authorities, they plot to capitalize on the suspicious nature of his situation. After pawning the car, a friend of the bystanders proceeds to tend to Weyland's injuries. Weyland's state of medical emergency leads him to rip out an 
IV
 and begin drinking the blood coming from the other end. This queer activity subsequently leads the men to sell Weyland to a man named Roger.

Roger holds Weyland captive in the spare room of his 
Manhattan
 apartment where he plans to display the vampire as a museum exhibit. The situation gets complicated when Roger's nephew Mark, the protagonist of the chapter, empathically befriends Weyland. Before long, Roger employs the aid of a 
satanist
 by the name of Alan Reese to market Weyland's captivity. When Alan's feeding schedule forces Weyland into 
starvation
, Mark intervenes. In doing so, Weyland is able to escape the confines of Roger's apartment and bring the chapter to a close.



Unicorn tapestry
[
edit
]


Just as the first two chapters are told from the point of view of Katje and Mark respectively, ""Unicorn Tapestry"" offers a new perspective on Weyland from yet another source, Dr. Floria Landauer. Floria is a 
psychotherapist
 who has been asked to counsel Dr. Weyland by Doug Sharpe, the dean of Cayslin College (page 122). Initially Weyland is resistant to Floria's sessions, claiming for example that he is being made ridiculous by her techniques (128). Eventually he warms up to her therapy and even begins to embrace it. He begins by coyly admitting his ""
delusions
"" of being a vampire (126), but this flowers into explications of his hunting habits (136), 
sexuality
 (141), take on 
humanity
 (148), and much more. Ultimately, Weyland sees the therapy sessions as a method of self-discovery for he has no knowledge of his origin and no other members of his species to interact with (158).

One day when Floria arrives at her office, her secretary Hilda exclaims that someone has been through their records. Floria immediately realizes that the perpetrator was Weyland and that he had confiscated all incriminating evidence of his condition. That evening when Floria returns home, Weyland is waiting for her. After acquiring a written testament to his mental well-being, Weyland threatens to kill Floria. Floria is able to convince him otherwise however by offering to fulfill his sexual curiosities. In the end, Weyland accepts her offer and leaves her be as he flees to 
New Mexico
.



A musical interlude
[
edit
]


Shortly after arriving in 
Albuquerque, New Mexico
, Weyland's colleagues invite him to attend an opera in 
Santa Fe
. During the drive over, Weyland begins to feel sick; he fed before leaving and never had the chance to rest (which upsets his system). Halfway through the performance, Weyland's upset stomach gets the best of him, and he is forced to leave the show. While wandering around the perimeter of theatre, Weyland comes across a man whom he attacks and kills. The kill was unprovoked, utilized a technique which Weyland had not used in years, and was not done out of hunger. Although confused by his own actions, Weyland is forced to focus on disposing the body. After doing so, Weyland re-enters the opera and reflects upon his actions.



The last of Dr. Weyland
[
edit
]


In the final chapter, Weyland remains in 
New Mexico
 as he continues his professorship at the 
University of New Mexico
. As a hunter, 
Albuquerque
 provides Weyland with a new set of challenges which he had not faced while in New York at Cayslin. In particular, the size of the city hinders Weyland's anonymity. Consequently, Weyland must establish a reliable social network from which to prey upon. One such member of this network is Alison Beader, a teaching assistant whom Weyland also engages with sexually. When Weyland is forced to sever his connection with Alison for fear that she is becoming too close to him, he finds himself between reliable food sources. One night he chooses to drive to a nearby campground to satisfy his hunger.

In parallel with Weyland's relationship to Alison, Weyland also begins to forge a relationship with a fellow 
anthropologist
 named Irv. One day Weyland is approached by a woman named Dorothea Winslow, a friend of Irv, and is asked if Irv has been acting himself lately. Weyland is indifferent to the question and answers that he is not sure. Soon after this encounter, Irv commits suicide and dedicates a large portion of his final letter to Weyland, drawing much unwanted attention to him. When Weyland returns home after the incident, Alan Reese is waiting for him. Alan claims that he knows about Floria and saw Weyland feeding at the campground. Alan holds Weyland at gunpoint, but Weyland is eventually able to reverse the situation by tricking Alan into thinking that he can turn him into a vampire. Rather than doing so, Weyland kills him. With growing fear of becoming discovered, Weyland is forced to enter a state of 
hibernation
 and the novel is brought to a close."

The prologue of the novel relates how humanity gives up the dream of 
space travel
, which is too difficult and dangerous and offers too little benefit, only to discover that there is another way to explore the universe.  Some people possess the ability to travel with their minds to other worlds.  Helped by new technology, they can explore another planet far across the galaxy while their bodies remain on Earth.

Shep Blaine is an explorer working for Fishhook, an organization exploiting paranormal powers to explore planets around other stars.  Because of anti-paranormal prejudice in the US, Fishhook operates in northern Mexico.  Explorers spend time in ""star machines"", which are boxes shaped and decorated to stimulate the mind to leave the body and explore the universe.  They are accompanied by a small machine that can record experiences and gather physical samples.  Some explorers have returned with minds affected by what they encountered.  Those explorers have disappeared and never been heard from again.

Blaine returns from one expedition having encountered an intelligence that looks like a large pink blob sitting immobile in a room open to the sky.  The blob greets him 
telepathically
 with the message ""Hi pal!  I trade with you my mind.""  Blaine immediately feels the alien mind alongside his own.  Returning to his body, he knows he must get away before the recording of his trip is checked.  However he is impeded, first by Kirby Rand, Fishhook's head of security, and then by a friend who persuades him to go to a high society cocktail party.  Realizing that fleeing to the US is the obvious thing to do, he goes along with this, since Fishhook would not risk the scandal of arresting him at the party, and he might find an opportunity to do something his pursuers are not likely to expect.  At the party he meets 
Harriet Quimby
, an investigative reporter who reveals herself to be a telepath.  She knows he is in trouble and tells him to discreetly leave the party and meet her outside.  His pursuers are waiting for him, but he escapes them as, for some reason, time slows down enabling him to slip past.  Harriet uses her knowledge of back roads, practiced for situations like this, to escape with him.

In the United States, he is separated from Harriet by local townspeople who identify him as a witch and intend to hang him.  Again, something unexpected happens to the flow of time, placing him a short time in the past, which is a ghostly, decaying shadow of the world.  He is able to walk out of the town before returning to normal time.  He encounters Riley, an old man nursing a decrepit pickup truck on a journey north.  They travel together for a while, discussing the state of the world.  Fishhook is operating a commercial monopoly on the science and technology found in the galaxy, disrupting commerce and daily life while people lapse into superstition and hatred of paranormals.  Some paranormals are retaliating by using their powers to terrorize people.  They meet a group of young levitators who fly around at night.  Riley shoots at them with a shotgun, but Blaine tries to make peace using his telepathy.  He bonds with one young girl, Anita.  He becomes separated from Riley, and enters a trance which results in him returning to visit the alien, who he calls the Pinkness.  The Pinkness is far older than the human race, and has been traveling the universe, exchanging minds with beings of all kinds.  Blaine settles in to learn from the Pinkness, but is abruptly returned to his body which has been in a coma for days.  He is in hospital next to Riley, who is severely injured.

Harriet shows up with Godfrey Stone, one of the travelers who disappeared.  He claimed to have seen a world free of evil, and was sent to an isolated institution where he could have lived in comfort.  He escaped, as did Lambert Finn, another explorer who found a place of total evil and became obsessed with eliminating Fishhook and all paranormal people.  Harriet reveals that Riley was transporting a stolen ""star machine"" for Stone, but intended to give it to Finn for use in his campaign.  Stone is killed by an unknown assailant, and the star machine is held by the police.  Again Blaine is able to manipulate time, removing the star machine to the future, which is a formless void.  Having done this, he is confronted by Kirby Rand, who has been tracking Blaine and the stolen machine.  Fishhook is determined to maintain its monopoly at all costs.  Finn is playing into their hands by keeping the technology illegal in the US.

Blaine is about to be returned to Fishhook when he uses another part of the alien knowledge to escape.  Confronting Finn, he uses his ultimate weapon: he trades minds with Finn.  Finn is driven insane by the presence in his own mind of all the things he hates and fears.  With Finn's mental state in his own mind, Blaine discovers that Finn had been secretly encouraging groups of paranormals to unleash a night of terror on Halloween, in order to turn the rest of the population against them.  He leaves to spread a warning among the paranormals, but in the process is trapped in an icy storm and almost freezes to death.

The horrors that Finn experienced, and that drove him to try to eliminate all paranormals, contained a clue to the ability to travel to other stars physically as well as mentally.  Blaine uses this to find an Earth-like planet and travel there to escape the storm.  He passes this knowledge to the other paranormals in the hope that they can escape the coming 
witch hunts
.  Returning to Finn he finds that the man has committed suicide.  He decides to remain on Earth until all the paranormals have made it to safety."

Acceptance
 jumps around in time and between the perspectives of several characters from the first two novels in the Southern Reach Series.

Annihilation, the first book in the series, was focused on a character known as The Biologist. She was part of a team that entered Area X, a restricted and uninhabited zone known for having anomalous events, which is controlled by a government organization called The Southern Reach. After being exposed to strange spores, she begins a transformation she calls ""brightness"". She investigates Area X, with an emphasis on an abandoned lighthouse which may have been the beginning site of the strange events.

Authority
, the second book in the series, followed the character John Rodriguez, a.k.a. ""Control"". An employee of the Southern Reach, he was tasked with interviewing what appears to be the Biologist, who escaped from Area X and prefers to be called ""Ghost Bird"". Later he determines Ghost Bird is not the biologist, but a duplicate of her which began germinating in Area X. When Area X begins to grow beyond its boundaries, Rodriguez flees with Ghost Bird.



The Lighthouse Keeper
[
edit
]


In the years before Area X, Saul Evans — the Lighthouse Keeper introduced in 
Annihilation
 — builds a friendship with nine-year-old Gloria, the girl who becomes the psychologist of the twelfth expedition and the former Director of the Southern Reach. While maintaining the lighthouse (the same one found in Area X), Saul is frustrated by the constant visits of Henry and Suzanne, two members of the Séance & Science Brigade (S&SB) who perform unknown experiments involving the lighthouse's lens. Later, a fire breaks out on nearby Failure Island, destroying S&SB's headquarters. While cleaning the grounds, Saul sees a mysterious flower of light on the floor. As he attempts to pluck it, it stabs his finger. Saul begins to have vivid nightmares: he imagines walking into his lighthouse only to discover it has transformed into the Tower. When he awakens, Saul begins reciting the sermon written by the Crawler on the walls of the Tower. Over time Saul becomes increasingly obsessed with the sermon.

Gloria leaves to be with her father just before Saul returns to the lighthouse at night and sees a glowing light emanating from the trapdoor beside the lens. Saul enters the light. When he awakens, he finds Henry and Suzanne's bodies beside him. However, a 
doppelgänger
 of Henry arrives and confronts Saul. The two eventually fall off the side of the lighthouse. Saul survives, but as he attempts to escape, visions of Area X flood his mind. Saul finally stops running, having accepted defeat. A tunnel, later referred to by expedition members as a tower, forms at the site where Saul falls. Saul becomes the Crawler which scrawls the organic words which descend the Tower.



The Psychologist/Director
[
edit
]


The second timeline describes Gloria's initial acceptance into the Southern Reach and her promotion to Director. She has a strained relationship with Lowry, the only survivor of the first expedition and the man responsible for organizing each subsequent journey into Area X. Without alerting anyone at the Southern Reach, Gloria secretly crosses the border into Area X with Whitby, a scientist working for the Southern Reach. She visits her childhood home, encounters the Crawler in the Tower, and visits the lighthouse. While Whitby is upstairs, he apparently (unseen to the Director) struggles with his duplicate and says that he killed it just before she rushed up to find him bruised and scratched, with no sign of the Dead Whitby. The Director finds a backpack Whitby swears belonged to Dead Whitby containing the cell phone and plant first mentioned in 
Authority
.

Upon her return, the Director refuses to relate her experiences to Lowry. Instead, she begins planning the twelfth expedition and interviews the biologist for the mission. It is then revealed that the Director has terminal cancer. She, therefore, decides to join the twelfth expedition in the hopes of visiting Area X one last time. The Director also learns that the S&SB may have been involved in the creation of Area X. When she confronts Lowry about this, he refuses to admit it. Finally, the Director pulls out a photo of the cell phone she found in Area X, arguing that it belonged to Lowry and was used to communicate with Area X. The Director believes that Area X is trying to communicate with Lowry because it has been found in such a serendipitous way and considering the strange goings-on surrounding it after it is found. Lowry eventually admits the phone belonged to him and storms off.

The Director's story ends with her embarking on the twelfth expedition as the psychologist. In her pocket is a letter to Saul Evans, which she hopes to give him when they meet again. However, as seen in 
Annihilation
, the Director dies before Saul can receive her message: an apology for never returning to the lighthouse as a child, thanks for his friendship and guidance, and a promise always to remember him as the Keeper of the Light.



Control & Ghost Bird
[
edit
]


Control and Ghost Bird enter Area X through a previously unknown portal. They wander in the wilderness before arriving at Failure Island, where they encounter Grace Stevenson (the assistant director of the Southern Reach, whom Control had previously worked with). She had fled the agency after killing a doppelganger and fleeing with a group of personnel into Area X.

Grace reveals why Area X grows so quickly: time moves faster inside the border during specific ""cosmic"" shifts that seem to happen randomly. Although Control and Ghost Bird have only been gone a few weeks, Grace has been waiting on the Island for three years. This also accounts for how some expeditions never return, as they may have been trapped there for years and eventually died. Grace also shows them the biologist's ""Last Will and Testament,"" detailing what happened to her after the events of 
Annihilation
: the biologist arrived at the Island in search of her husband, believing that the man who returned from the eleventh expedition was a copy of her husband generated by Area X. The biologist instead encounters an owl which becomes her companion for the next thirty years. The owl behaves strangely compared to typical owl behavior. Over time she comes to believe that the owl is the form that her husband took after he was changed by Area X. She has held off the takeover by the brightness, using pain as a way for her body to resist it, and believes that her eventual change will likely be more radical, perhaps into something like the moaning creature. Eventually, the owl dies, and the brightness that afflicts the biologist swallows her whole.

Grace announces that the biologist is returning to the Island. Ghost Bird — herself a copy of the biologist generated by Area X — encounters her original self, transformed into a staggeringly immense, hyper-sentient, whale-like creature, unbound by physical law and covered with eyes. Control, Ghost Bird, and Grace decide to return to the Tower, where Ghost Bird encounters the Crawler. When she touches it, she sees the birth of Area X as if it is its own universe. Grace shoots at the Crawler and accidentally hits Ghost Bird.

Meanwhile, Control, overcome by the brightness, is transforming into something nonhuman, a loping creature with paws. Maimed by the Crawler and close to death, he descends further into the Tower. As he comes closer to the light at the bottom of the Tower, he realizes that it is the flower that pricked Saul and created Area X. He leaps into the light.

Grace and Ghost Bird exit the Tower and head to the border. Ghost Bird is ambivalent about the possible total expansion of Area X but is mindful of Grace and her connection to others outside of Area X. They find the Southern Reach building abandoned. The two continue walking, unsure if Area X is gone or if the border has expanded even further."

In the year 2087, Earth is nearly crime free and the 
artificial intelligence
 
One True
 telepathically controls humans. The main character and first person narrator is forty-nine-year-old Currie Curtis Curran, a retired 
mercenary
 soldier and ""cowboy hunter"". He is recalled from retirement to capture ""Lobo"" Dave Singleton, the last of the ""cowboys"", people beyond the control of One True hiding in the 
Colorado wilderness
.

Currie's contact with One True is through a copy of the 
Resuna
 ""meme"", a ""neurocode"" program 
uploaded
 into the brain, and an implanted ""cellular jack"" radio device.  In addition to communicating with One True, Resuna monitors its host's thoughts and emotions, provides everyday information and communication, 
downloads
 requested memories or skills, adjusts their physiology, and, when offered the spoken code phrase ""let overwrite, let override"", can assume control of its host's body, and erase memories.  Resuna learns its host's preferences and habits, is friendly and communicative, and can even play 
chess
 with its host or engage in other pastimes.

Ten years before, Currie was the leader of a team of cowboy hunters who captured Lobo's cowboy gang after a long pursuit in which several of the team were killed and several, including Currie, badly injured.  During their final confrontation, Currie sees Lobo fall from a high cliff, apparently to his death.  In his briefing by One True, Currie is shown the recorded memories of a mother and daughter beaten, raped, and robbed by Lobo days earlier.  Although such emotions are normally kept in check by Resuna, Currie is allowed to feel revulsion and hatred of Lobo, to improve his performance as a hunter.  One True explains to Currie that, to decrease his chance of being detected and evaded, he has been assigned to hunt Lobo alone.

After goodbyes to his wife of 23 years, Mary, Currie is dropped of by diskster (a futuristic, automatically piloted hovercraft) with various high-tech equipment, including an advanced cold weather suit, shape-adjusting 
ski
/
snowshoes
, and a shelter that self-assembles from collected 
carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen
 matter.

Within days, Currie is captured by Lobo, awakening after many days unconscious from the severe blow to his head that incapacitated him in a comfortable, geothermally-heated underground lair, to discover his copy of Resuna no longer responding to his mental or spoken requests.  Nursed back to health by Lobo/Dave, the two men exchange life stories, which are so similar they joke that they could be brothers.  No longer controlled by Resuna and One True, Currie agrees to join Dave in an effort to hide from One True.

About half of the book consists of Currie and Dave's telling of their personal and the Earth's general history.  Among the details revealed are that the beatings and rapes shown to Currie were fabrications, and that the mother and child are actually Dave's wife and child, who were captured and ""turned"" by One True during the ""Meme Wars"", giving them false memories of their history, from which, during Dave's actual visit to them to obtain medicine and supplies, he was able to temporarily free them.

Currie's search for Dave resulted in enough information being uploaded that they must abandon his lair and attempt to build another, while remaining undetected by One True's network of 
surveillance satellites
.  While caching supplies, Currie has a skiing fall, and, shaken up and angry, reflexively says ""let overwrite, let override"", to find himself immediately calm.  A little later, he realizes that after saying the trigger phrase, he was unconscious and under the control of his Resuna for several minutes, during which time it/he carelessly left a trail visible to satellites, and, he assumes, Resuna uploaded information to One True, though he is still unable to make the usual mental contact with Resuna.  Hurrying to their old lair to warn Dave, he discovers in a previously unexplored room there a 
suspended animation
 device, unmentioned in Dave's story, and beyond anything he could have constructed himself.  Dave informs him that, while he was unconscious, Dave used various means to burn out his cellular jack, assuring that even if his Resuna reactivated, it would be unable to contact One True, and promising to tell him the omitted parts of his story after they have fled to safety.

After abandoning the first lair, while the two work to excavate their new one, Dave tells more of his life story.  As Dave reaches its conclusion, Currie realizes that his disabled Resuna is not due to his head injury, but due to Dave uploading an additional meme, ""Freecyber"".  Although designed during the Meme Wars to disable other memes, principally One True, Dave's story explained that every version of Freecyber had ""mutated"" into as controlling a meme as the ones it was intended to fight.  Enraged, Currie attacks Dave, and is on the verge of killing him when Dave shouts ""let overwrite, let override"", disabling Currie, and flees.

Upon regaining consciousness, Currie finds his Resuna fully functional, though still unable to contact with One True.  He pursues Dave, arriving at the original lair to discover him already captured by a large team of hunters.  Making no effort to fight or hide, Curry joins them, and returns to his home and civilization.

Back in civilization, a cellular jack is installed in Dave's head, but One True is unable to load a functioning Resuna in his brain.  Currie's Resuna is behaving atypically, indicating to he and it that it has become a true, human-like person.  He neither requests nor is compelled to have his burnt-out jack repaired, and demands to be allowed to speak with One True via eyes and ears.   One True speaks with him, explaining that his Resuna is an experimental version designed to interact with Freecyber, and that his mission was planned to result in his capture in order for One True to obtain a ""wild copy"" of the last generation of Freecyber for its research.  As a learning AI, One True explains, it is dissatisfied with its lack of true human empathy and the lack of freedom accorded humans under the present scheme, and seeks to change it, without allowing human society to return to its previous warring, suffering state.

The story closes a few years later, with Dave, his wife Nancy, Currie, and Mary listening to Dave's daughter Kelly give a philosophical speech at her high school graduation, while Currie, his cellular jack repaired, converses with One True about Kelly's speech, the reluctance of many people to replace their old, more controlling version of Resuna with new ones, and the nature of the human experience."

 would not arrive at its destination until 230 Earth years have passed. The crew of 104 soldiers, scientists, and civilians were put in biostasis, to be awakened from their virtual immortality by the ship's AI 226 years into the future. (Four years are spared due to 
time dilation
.) 47 Ursae Majoris' system has four planets—named Fox, Raven, Bear and Wolf after

Three months into the journey, Leslie Gillis, the senior communications officer, is awakened from biostasis. Expecting the year to be 2300, Gillis is horrified when he questions the AI. Owing to a mixup, it is nowimpossible for Gillis to return to his dreamless sleep. His options are either suicide or a lonely existence. Gillis decides to live. 

After a brief chat with the AI, Gillis learns that Eric Gunther was originally scheduled to awaken three months into the trip. Gunther is an agent for the URA, and was to attempt to contact the president or destroy the ship. The program was changed at the last minute to wake someone else instead—Gillis. Gillis leaves a note for Captain Lee explaining Gunther's plot. Why they were changed at the last minute remains a mystery, but it was a change that would cost Gillis his life.

During his solitary life, he does everything he can to keep from going insane, attempting to eat and sleep at regular hours, reading all of the books available, playing chess against the AI, writing stories, and painting. Using practically all of the ship's art supplies, Gillis creates a story about a prince named Rupurt and the fantastic alien world he lives in. He paints scenes of his books on the walls. Eventually, Gillis dies in his old age after a fall from a ladder while trying to get a better look at an alien ship he has seen. The AI automatically expels his body into space and sails on to 47 Ursae Majoris with no more incidents.

The crew is awakened as planned in the year 2300. The 
Alabama
 has entered the 47 Ursae Majoris system and is approaching its third planet, Bear (currently known as 
47 Ursae Majoris b
) is a 
gas giant
. Coyote, its fourth moon, is larger than Mars and is lush with green plants and rivers of water. This will be the crew's new home. Captain Lee directs the landing procedures of the two ships docked to the 
Alabama
, the 
Wallace
 and the 
Helms
.

The crew finds Coyote to be habitable, but very peculiar nevertheless. Its seasons change at a much slower rate than Earth's. A year for Coyote consists of 1,096 days, with days lasting 27 hours. Lifeforms on Coyote seem similar to those on Earth at first glance, but behave in unique ways. As described in Gillis' novel, the world is home to gigantic bird-like creatures which are anything but friendly. The settlers call them ""boids"", which is Gillis' term for the beasts in his novel. Boids are common in the grasslands around the new settlement.

The remainder of 
Coyote
 follows the adventures of Carlos Montero and Wendy Gunther along the banks of the equatorial river which stretches around Coyote.

The novel takes the form of an oral history told by a young man named ""Rush that Speaks"" and of his wandering through a strange, 
post-apocalyptic
 world in pursuit of several seemingly incompatible goals. Each of the four divisions of his story are recorded on a separate crystal, and chapters correspond to facets of each crystal.

The story is set in a post-technological future; the present age is dimly remembered in story and legend, but without nostalgia or regret. The people of Rush's world are engaged in living their own lives in their own cultures. Words and artifacts from current time survive into Rush's age, suggesting that it is only a few millennia in the future. Yet there are hints that human society and even human biology are significantly changed. Even such basics as reproduction and eating have been altered, one by industrial-age 
genetic tampering
, the other by contact with 
extraterrestrial life
.

Rush comes of age in Little Belaire, a mazelike village of invisible, shifting boundaries, of secret paths and meandering stories and antique bric-a-brac carefully preserved in carved chests. The inhabitants are divided into clans called ""cords"" based on personality traits. Over the centuries, the people of Little Belaire have perfected an art which they call ""truthful speaking"": communication so clear and accurate, so ""transparent"", as to leave no potential for deception or misunderstanding. Perhaps as a result of this practice, Little Belaire appears to be free of any violence or even serious competition. Another result of truthful speaking is the existence of the ""
saints
"", those whose stories speak not only of the specifics of their own lives, but about the human condition. Yet even with the benefit of truthful speaking, secrets and mysteries
remain.

Rush's journey is set in motion when the girl he loves, Once a Day, elopes from Little Belaire to join another group, an enigmatic society called Dr. Boots's List. In his search for her, Rush befriends a hermit and an ""avvenger"" and shares the secrets of the List. Ultimately he discovers a transparent sainthood stranger than any story told by the gossips of Little Belaire."

In the early 21st century, 
NATO
 and the 
Soviet Union
 are on the verge of a second 
nuclear war
. Incidentally, a 290 km 
prolate spheroid
 has been detected following an anomalous energy burst just outside the 
Solar System
. It is an asteroid, and a duplicate of 
Juno
.  It moves into an 
eccentric
 near-Earth orbit where the rival polities of Earth each try to claim this mysterious object.

Juno has been hollowed out along its long axis, subdivided into seven cylindrical chambers, and rotates to provide 
artificial gravity
. The chambers are 
terraformed
, with the second and third containing cities that have been maintained by automatic systems for centuries. This small world is dubbed ""the Stone"" by the Americans, ""the Potato"" by the Soviets, ""the Whale"" (
鲸
) by the Chinese and ""
Thistledown
"" by its absent makers. Explorers of its interior discover that the end of the Stone's seventh chamber opens into ""the Way"", a corridor that extends beyond the size of the asteroid endlessly. The Stone’s original inhabitants have been evacuated into the Way at some time in its past, which is the explorers’ future.

At the opening of the novel, in 2005, Judith Hoffmann, head of the commission that coordinates the exploration of the Stone, recruits theoretical physicist Patricia Vasquez, who arrives at the Stone and receives clearance for all the information discovered by the existing science teams, including libraries that describe a 
nuclear holocaust
—""the Death""—taking place in 2005. Only some 
NATO
 science teams are privy to this information. Chinese and Russian science teams are present, but politically restricted.

Since the Stone appears before the recorded date of the Death, and there is no record of the Stone's appearance in its libraries, the scientists reason that the Stone may come from an 
alternate future
, but it turns out the Death is indeed imminent even with the Stone—whose appearance may have worsened the political situation. Angered by the restrictions placed on its scientists, the USSR sends space-assault teams to attack the Stone, triggering the Death and a 
nuclear winter
 on Earth that isolates survivors from all factions on the Stone.

The descendants of the Stone's creators live a million kilometers into the Way and 1,200 years into Vasquez's future, in a society called the Hexamon. They have been secretly observing the explorers. Olmy, a humanoid agent of the Hexamon, and his nameless alien Frant colleague, kidnap Vasquez as she begins to discover secrets of the Stone and the Way. They take her to Axis City, their main settlement. Four of her colleagues search for her using a specially-modified 
V/STOL
 craft connected to a ""tuberider"", a device that allows the craft to be hitched to the tubular singularity that runs through the center of the Way.

The rescuers are intercepted when they near Axis City and reunited with Vasquez, who is caught up in the politics of the Hexamon. It is presided over by a governing body, the Nexus, loosely divided into two social groups: Progressive Geshels, who embrace body-swapping and life-extending technologies, and conservative Naderites. The latter are named after 
Ralph Nader
, who has become identified with empathy and opposition to nuclear war in the centuries since his death. The Hexamon control traffic through spacetime “gates” in the Way’s surface that lead to other worlds, and are threatened by alien invaders called the Jart, who are more adapted to the physics of the Way and live beyond its 2x10^9 kilometer (2 billion kilometer) point.

The Jart attempt to destroy the Hexamon by opening a gate into the heart of a star, allowing superheated plasma to enter. To counter the threat, a coalition within the Hexamon seizes control of the Nexus. The first part of their plan involves accelerating some tuberiding human habitats to near light-speed. Scientists theorize that the shockwave thus generated will protect them from the blast of stellar plasma, while simultaneously sealing open gates along the Way and destroying their enemies, the Jart. The second half of their plan requires the separation of the Stone from the Way. When this is done, two more Hexamon habitats join the Stone in Earth orbit, at the time just after the Death."

Exultant
 is set in Baxter's ""
Xeelee Sequence
"" twenty thousand years into the Third Expansion of Mankind, ""a titanic project undertaken by a mankind united by the Doctrines forged by 
Hama Druz
 after mankind's near extinction."" The human-supremacist Interim Coalition of Governance has conquered almost the whole 
Milky Way
 — all but the alien Xeelee concentrated at the galactic core around a 
supermassive black hole
 called Chandra. The mysterious Xeelee are far more advanced but less numerous than the humans, and the war has been at a stalemate for three millennia even though the entire Coalition has been directed toward the war effort and ten billion humans die at the front every year. In a war fought with 
faster-than-light
 technology (equivalent to 
time travel
), each side has foreknowledge of the other's actions and can develop counter-measures to plans before they are made.

Pirius is a fighter pilot stationed at the front. When a battle turns to disaster for the Coalition forces, he disobeys suicide orders to stand and fight, choosing instead to risk survival. In a desperate gamble to outrun a pursuing Xeelee, Pirius captures a Xeelee fighter for the first time in history. Returning to base via FTL travel, he arrives two years previous to the battle, when his younger self is still a cadet. Rather than being lauded as a hero, both instances of Pirius are court-martialed for disobeying orders.

Commissary Nilis of the Office of Technological Archival and Control, part of the Commission for Historical Truth, defends both the older Pirius (whom he calls ""Pirius Blue"") and the younger one (""Pirius Red"") but loses the trial. Pirius Blue is sent to a penal unit at the front as a foot soldier, and Pirius Red is remanded to the custody of Commissary Nilis, who has plans for the fruits of Pirius Blue's battlefield victory. Using the Xeelee fighter and the innovative tactics that saved Pirius Blue, he starts to plan an unheard of assault on the Xeelee's primary stronghold at Chandra itself.

While Nilis and his new team struggle to confront ossified government and military institutions, they try to understand and to develop new and sometimes alien technologies: FTL computers, a 
gravastar
 shield to protect them from FTL foreknowledge, and a 
black hole gun
, capable of disrupting a 
supermassive black hole
's event horizon. Meanwhile, in the course of his new duties to Commissary Nilis, Pirius Red is practically taken on a tour of the 
Solar System
 and some of the Coalition's most scandalous secrets, rife with references to events from previous books in the Xeelee sequence.

As Nilis's project nears completion, it transpires that the Chandra black hole is home to not only the Xeelee, but a host of other organisms, many of which are based on exotic physics and non-baryonic matter. Regardless, the assault on the black hole continues despite protestations from Nilis. After a brutal fight to reach the surface of the black hole, the team commence their assault, causing the Xeelee to abandon it (and the rest of the Milky Way galaxy) to prevent humanity from harming the black hole's inhabitants.

After the assault, the protagonists realise that the Coalition is unlikely to remain intact, now that the war with the Xeelee is no longer present to hold it together. Luru Parz, one of the team, realises that the Xeelee will eventually return, and returns to Earth to ready its defences for when the return happens."

Nona, an unknown being housed in the body of Harrowhark, awakens on an unknown planet. Harrow, along with the cavalier Pyrrha in the Lyctor Gideon's body, was rescued by Camilla and Palamedes (who are now sharing a body) from the River at the end of 
Harrow the Ninth
. Despite carrying out a number of tests, Camilla and Palamedes are unable to determine Nona's true identity, though they believe she is either Gideon or Harrow. Nona displays several magical abilities: she heals faster than a Lyctor, and she understands any language (including body language).

Nona works as a teacher's assistant at a school where she befriends local kids. She, Camilla, Palamedes, Pyrrha, and Coronabeth Tridentarius (now called ""Crown"") are together working as ""Troia cell,"" an operation run by the Blood of Eden (BoE) rebel group. Troia reports to We Suffer, who controls a BoE faction seeking to negotiate with the Nine Houses, with the secret objective of gathering the necessary materials to open the Locked Tomb. We Suffer hopes that Nona will prove to be a Lyctor who can aid them in the execution of this objective. We Suffer's faction is in conflict with the militant, anti-negotiation ""Merv Wing,"" commanded by Unjust Hope, which publicly burns to death all ""zombies"" (anyone suspected of being necromantic).

The Empire's military branch, the Cohort, has abandoned the planet save for a few holdouts in the barracks following the arrival of Resurrection Beast Number 7, Varun. Varun is ""periscoping""—it is projecting a spirit-image of itself as a prelude to full materialization. This drives any necromancer insane, except for those protected by being in non-necromantic bodies. For this reason, Judith Deuteros, Heir to the Second House and a BoE captive, is an incoherent vessel for Varun to speak through. Only Nona can understand its screams, and it seems to know her, calling her a ""green thing.""

Ianthe Tridentarius arrives onworld looking for the Sixth House, which has deserted from the Nine Houses following the testimony of its leader (Palamedes) and instructions left by its Lyctor (Cassiopeia). Ianthe pilots the dead body of her cavalier Naberius to avoid being driven mad by Varun, and demands all House citizens turn themselves in. Crown goes to meet her, pretending to be seeking asylum for Judith, while Pyrrha also appears in the guise of the Lyctor Gideon. Having seen the inside of the barracks, Pyrrha is able to provide BoE key intel via a bug hidden on Judith, using coded words previously arranged with the others.

Camilla and Palamedes arrive at the barracks with Nona pretending to be Harrow. Manipulating Ianthe in order to touch her, Palamedes takes control of Naberius' body. The groups proceeds to find Gideon Nav's body, who initially pretends to be dead, only to reveal that her soul, or part of it (or a version of it) is in fact animating the now-invulnerable corpse. She calls herself Prince Kiriona, Heir to the Nine Houses.

Varun begins to materialize and its insectoid herald warriors fall to the planet's surface. After talking through Judith with Nona atop of a truck, Varun agrees to pull back. Unfortunately, many of its heralds have already arrived. We Suffer's faction takes cover underground, where they find and capture Merv Wing's convoy transporting the Sixth House hostages.

With everyone of import now assembled, they intend to complete the mission of opening the Locked Tomb. This requires travel through the River, something only a powerful Lyctor can achieve. Camilla and Palamedes therefore merge their souls in an advanced form of Lyctorhood, and are able to move a megatruck into the River. Here they find no ravenous ghosts, but instead a mysterious tower.

Nona helps them pilot to the Ninth House. She feels that she is dying; she states she does not have the right soul for the body that she's in, and so is coming untethered and losing her ability to control Harrow's body. She is increasingly aware of other thoughts in her mind: either the residual souls of Harrow and Gideon (the body's previous owners), or the thoughts of Nona's true self who can ""remember.""

They find that the Ninth House is under attack from unknown entities called devils, the same possessive force that killed Colum in the first book. Ianthe attempts to block their way to the tomb, but she is bested thanks to Gideon's triple cross and Pyrrha's herald bullet. Gideon claims that God wants the tomb open, but the truth of the matter is unclear.

Entering the tomb, Nona remembers having done this before, proving after many increasingly clear hints that she is none other than Alecto, the body in the tomb. Alecto entered Harrow's body when Harrow was ten, when she opened the tomb and kissed the body, providing a conduit for possession. This is why Harrow had visions of the body; Alecto was possessing her the whole time. Alecto finally took control, manifesting as Nona, after Gideon and Harrow's souls were removed at the end of the preceding novel. At that time, Gideon was possibly removed by God, and Harrow intentionally placed her own soul in the Locked Tomb in Alecto's sleeping body.

These events are interspersed with dreamlike memories in which John Gaius reveals the secrets behind the destruction of Earth and his ascent to divinity: he destroyed the already dying Earth, consumed much of her soul to become God, and stuffed the rest of the Earth into a body inspired by his favourite Barbie. Each of these chapters is titled with a reference to a verse from 
John's Gospel
.

Now Nona reunites with Alecto's body, and the souls are switched to their correct places. Alecto returns to her body, waking it, and Harrow returns to hers. Harrow declares her love for Alecto, only for Alecto to swear service to Harrow as the descendent of Anastasia (founder of the Ninth House, to whom Alecto swore a sacred oath). Alecto then proceeds to travel through the river to John Gaius, who she then stabs through the chest."

In 1965, the United States and Canada have been at war with the Soviet Union and the Chinese People's Republic for three years. Both sides' 
atomic weapons
 are ineffective as 
surface-to-air missiles
 shoot down any bombers or guided missiles, so ground forces have done most of the fighting. The Communist nations—whose armies vastly outnumber the North Americans—conquered Western Europe, invaded South America, and are moving toward Texas. All American males must perform agricultural work to feed the armed forces or be 
drafted
 into military, construction, or factory service. Food, electricity, and gasoline are rationed, only two 
CONELRAD
 stations broadcast on radio, and New York City is reportedly under 
martial law
.

Billy Justin, a 37-year-old commercial artist, and 
Korean War
 veteran, is working as a 
dairy farmer
 in Chiunga County, New York, when the radio announces that Soviet and Chinese forces have overrun the Canadian-American line at 
El Paso, Texas
. In 
New Mexico
, the Communist armies capture the 
Los Alamos National Laboratory
 and destroy the incomplete 
Yankee Doodle
, a satellite capable of dropping 
hydrogen bombs
 
from orbit
 that are impossible to shoot down.

The 
President of the United States
 surrenders to the Communists, who over the next several months partition the country at the 
Mississippi River
 and set up a joint 
puppet state
, the North American People's Democratic Republic. Other than a military garrison, disarmament of the civilian population, searches for 
fissionable material
, and establishing production quotas for food, the surrender of the United States leaves Chiunga Center largely untouched. The Soviets execute local 
fifth column
 members who had secretly aided the invasion to prevent them from organizing against the new government but are otherwise relatively peaceful and amenable to the 
black market
.

A 
paraplegic
 comes to Justin's farm asking for work; he is General Hollerith, a veteran of the previous war. He and Justin join a conspiracy to finish the real satellite, a crewed 
space station
 buried in Chiunga County that the United States had been building for 15 years. It requires parts and engineering knowledge to launch. 
MVD
 troops arrive, shoot the corrupt Soviet soldiers, and are much more cruel. To Justin's knowledge, they capture all of the conspirators but himself and the general.

Justin deduces that the contacts he needs to make are in 
Washington, Pennsylvania
. With a traveling preacher, Sparhawk, Justin walks hundreds of miles from Chiunga Center to Washington, benefiting from the Democratic Republic's policy of respecting the Americans' 
freedom of religion
. At Washington, Justin receives instructions from the nationwide 
resistance movement
 for an attack planned for Christmas Eve on Chiunga Center to liberate the satellite.

Despite the Soviets' arrest and torture of a local farmer, they are ignorant of what ""Christmas Eve"", a mild oath they have heard sworn by various citizens, means until the battle begins. Coordinated by Hollerith, bridges around the area are blown up, and nearby arsenals are sabotaged. The townspeople, many of whom are veterans, battle the Soviets as the space station launches.

Hollerith's forces triumph and the Americans transmit an ultimatum to the Soviets and Chinese: The satellite is armed and will destroy Moscow and Peking in 24 hours if occupation forces do not withdraw from American soil and free all prisoners of war. Hollerith offers Justin important positions in the new government and society, but he refuses them and kneels in prayer with Sparhawk, fearing the fulfillment of 
mutual assured destruction

The story of 
Spinning Silver
 unfolds in the voices of several characters, but primarily in the voices of three young women who struggle against strong evil forces, in an imaginary medieval eastern European kingdom called Lithvas.
[
1
]


Over the last seven years, Lithvas has been suffering from long, brutal winters that are slowly killing its people. Miryem Mandelstam, a young Jewish girl, takes over her father's moneylending business to save her family from poverty. A village girl, Wanda and later her brother, become the Mandelstams' servants. One night, Miryem, flush with her financial success, brags to her mother that she can “turn silver into gold”. Her boast is overheard by the Staryk, a race of 
fae
 creatures who emerge from their own world every winter to raid human settlements, and Miryem receives three deliveries of magical silver. Realizing that the Staryk will kill her if she does not give them gold in exchange, she has the metal made into three pieces of jewellery to sell. However, after the sale of the second piece, Miryem demands payment for her work; to Miryem’s horror, the Staryk king tells her that after the third, her ""reward"" will be marriage to him.

The jewellery is bought by the duke of the city of Vysnia for his daughter, Irina; he then persuades Mirnatius, the tsar of Lithvas, to marry her. On her wedding night, Irina discovers that while wearing her Staryk jewellery, she can cross into the Staryk kingdom and magically observe her husband. Mirnatius has a contract allowing his body to be inhabited by 
Chernobog
, a demon who drinks souls and can only emerge at night due to his hatred of sunlight. Each evening, the new tsarina escapes to the fae world, where she is safe from the demon.

After the Staryk king abducts Miryem to his palace, she learns that she can literally change silver into gold with a touch. She also discovers that the Staryk king is responsible for lengthening the winters in Lithvas, and that it is his desire to make them permanent. Although she hates her husband, who refuses even to tell her his name due to the power over him it would give her, Miryem comes to know and care for some of the Staryk; she also sees that their kingdom is suffering mysterious damages. While out exploring, Miryem encounters Irina. The two women create a plan to bring their husbands together, in the hopes that they will destroy one another. Because Miryem cannot cross to the human world alone, she bargains with the king: he will take her to attend her cousin’s wedding in Vysnia if she can transform three of his enormous vaults of silver within three days. She succeeds, barely, with the help of her servants.

Chernobog promises that, in exchange for Irina giving him the Staryk king, he will never harm her or anyone she cares about. She takes him to the wedding, where he confronts the king. With the help of the mortals, the demon imprisons the Staryk and begins consuming his magic. Mirnatius tells Irina that he did not choose the contract with Chernobog, but was promised to the demon by his own mother in exchange for her marrying his father, the previous tsar. Once the king is bound, spring arrives. However, Miryem is troubled to realize that the fae kingdom and its inhabitants, including those who helped her, will all be destroyed as the king is drained. She goes to her husband and learns that, while the Staryk have always raided the human world, they began trying to exterminate Lithvas with brutal winters only after Mirnatius became tsar. Through the magical connection between the fae and human kingdoms, the demon caused the weakening of the Staryk world.

Miryem frees the king after extracting a promise that he will end the killing winters and the raids. Chernobog, enraged, threatens Irina until she offers to take him to the Staryk kingdom. There, Miryem lures the demon into the king’s treasury, and once he is surrounded by silver, she turns it into gold. Unable to bear the touch of solid sunlight on his skin, Chernobog flees back to the human world. In the mortal lands, the demon attempts to turn on Irina, but finds himself powerless when she reminds him of their bargain not to harm her or anyone of hers. As tsarina, she counts all the people of Lithvas as hers - including the tsar. Chernobog is thus forced from Mirnatius's body and killed.

As spring has returned to Lithvas, Miryem is obliged to remain in the Staryk kingdom until the day of the first snow. However, when she returns to the human world, she realizes that she has become attached to the kingdom, its people, and its king. She is nevertheless astonished when the king asks for permission to court her. She consents, and the pair are wed two weeks later. Miryem notes that, in accordance with Jewish custom, her husband signed his name on their marriage contract - but in accordance with Staryk custom, she will never reveal it to anyone.

When Yalda is three years old, she accompanies her grandfather Dario into the forest to convalesce, but he instead passes away. The following spring, she sees a shooting star in the sky. When Yalda is twelve years old, she joins school and learns about the basic laws of physics, including those of light, leading her to realize that space and time are exactly the same. The following summer, she observes multiple shooting stars hurtling across the sky. When Yalda has reached adulthood and embarked a career as a physicist, she begins to study light and in particular the strange phenomenon now known as the Hurtlers, which all enter the planetary system from the same spacial direction, but at different times. Yalda theorizes, that the roles are reversed for the Hurtlers, meaning for them an entire cluster spread over space arrives at the same time, hence the direction of time of this cluster and their own are orthogonal to each other. Now their home world is threatened by the arrival of the Hurtlers and might face complete destruction by an impending collision.

An unusual reaction to this crisis is brought up by Eusebio, a student of Yalda. Developing the technology necessary will take too much time, therefore a generation ship must be sent into the void to exploit relativistic effects to find the time elsewhere. While accelerating, deaccelerating as well as turning the ship around, time will pass on the home world. But the journey aligned with the orthogonal cluster and the velocity of the Hurtlers and as long as needed will be witnessed as being along a purely spatial dimension from the home world, hence in an orthogonal direction. Yalda remarks that the largest rockets build yet have a lot smaller size. Eusebio had taken this into account: Since the nearby Mount Peerless is made out of very hard sunstone, it can be turned into the rocket needed. The plan then includes blasting the whole mountain into the sky.

Eusebio conducts the first experiments of sending sunstone off their world on Mount Peerless and finally succeeds by launching a piece into orbit around their sun. Yalda receives a letter of her sister Lucia meanwhile, in which she informs her of changes on the farm and her decision of becoming a mother, resulting in the end of her own life due to their way of reproduction. Yalda and Eusebio travel around different cities to gather endorsement for their plan. Yalda meets Benedetta, with whom she has a conversation about that the course of the rocket points into its own past, which allows for the conclusion of 
determinism
 in their universe. The question arises, if their already predetermined actions are then even relevant at all. Yalda can convince Benedetta, who then decides to be the first passenger. At night, Yalda and Eusebio witness the destruction of the twin planets Gemma and Gemmo in their own system by one of the Hurtlers. This catastrophic event causes massive endorsement for their plan and the preparation of Mount Peerless begins.

Five years later, the work is almost done, but the 
Peerless
 still lacks a proper crew due to safety concerns or the restricted quality of life on board. Even for many working on the rocket, just waiting for four years on the home world for its return with incredibly advanced technology is the preferred option. Benedetta has send out space probes, which have examined the Hurtlers and determined their direction of time, which turns out to not be perfectly orthogonal to that of their home world. Luckily, the 
Peerless
 will first travel into the future of the orthogonal cluster, pushing certain problems with 
causality
 to the return journey into its past. Benedetta then plans to test a rocket made out of sunstone herself to persuade the workers of its safety, but instead dies pointlessly during the test. Eusebio tells Yalda, that he won't join the journey and stay behind on the home world to fight for launching another generation ship in case the 
Peerless
 will fail and won't return in four years.

After the 
Peerless
 has been launched and entered the orthogonal cluster, the crew encounters the first major problem: Their crops seem to rely on gravity to grow, which is no longer present after the acceleration phase. Constructions begin on getting the mountain to spin to generate 
artificial gravity
 and making the crops grow again. In the meantime, Yalda and the other females on board begin to slowly use up their stocks of Holin, a drug to halt spontaneous reproduction with more being needed with older age. Yalda needs multiple the amount than younger females, which makes her reflect on her role in the journey and that she may have had the illusion to experience its return. Yalda realizes that the journey is now about the next generation, whom she has already taught everything she knew during the acceleration phase, so she and the other older females make their conscious decision for reproduction. Yalda hands over the command of the 
Peerless
 and then mates with Nino, who was imprisoned for engaging in espionage during the construction of the 
Peerless
. In her final moments, she thinks about the life of her children lying ahead."

The protagonist, Larry Dever, is gravely injured resulting in a radical surgical procedure, a 
hemicorporectomy
, in which tissue below the waist is removed. He is outfitted with a set of intelligent mechanical legs, a ""manniquin"", and is placed into suspended animation until the damaged tissue can be restored. He wakes at a time when cloning technology can replace his legs, although for a price. Years before he was awakened, a clone, or ""bud child"", was created and is now a thriving young boy without language. Horrified by the prospect of his child being sacrificed to provide him with a new lower body, Larry opts to return to suspended animation. His child, Dim Dever, is selected by the guiding world computer, called Olga, to carry his ancient genes to a possible new colony on a planet orbiting 
Procyon
.

Larry awakens again in a nightmare future. Far from the highly advanced past, now an enormous human population – 3.5 trillion – covers every inch of the planet in underground shaft cities. Technology and science have degraded, and all freely breeding species have been exterminated except for the five-toed neolithic humans, which are classified as a garden varmint. The 'Hive' or human population of Nebishes – four-toed humans – within its computer-supported subterranean culture ruthlessly hunts, kills, and recycles anyone who consumes their crops, the Benthic Beasts, which are five-toed humans that have formed a precarious niche in abandoned underwater rec domes.

As Larry is trying to adapt to his new life, without most of his own body or his ""cyber"" torso, accompanied by Big Har, a genetic defect sent for destruction as an infant but managing to escape 'tweenwalls' in the shaft city- something re-awakens an ancient, half-derelict cyborg, the Godwhale of the title. This enormous 'rake' is an ocean-going biota harvester built in part from a genetically modified blue whale. Initially attempting to rejoin human civilization, the Godwhale (named Rorqual Maru or 'Whale Ship' in Japanese), along with its class six companion cyber, Iron Trilobite, eventually teams up with a genetically modified clone of Larry, ARNOLD (Augmented Renal Nucleus of Larry Dever), Larry himself, and an assortment of misfits and refugees from the Hive. Together they set out to try to find out what mysteriously brings the marine biota back to the previously sterile oceans, while a tiny group from the Hive, the outcasts, and their cyber deities survive and thrive in the face of incredible bungling by the 'Class One' computer that manages humanity and the various castes of 'Nebish' humans brought into the fight."

At the end of 
The Mote in God's Eye
, Renner and Bury are secretly enlisted into Imperial Naval Intelligence. Neither is happy about the arrangement at first, but they spend the next twenty-five years effectively preventing rebellions against the Empire so that the Imperial Navy can concentrate on blockading the Moties in their star system.

While investigating suspicious economic activity on the planet Maxroy's Purchase, Renner and Bury encounter wide idiomatic usage of the phrase ""...on the gripping hand"". The source of the phrase turns out to be innocuous enough — the governor picked up the expression as a crewman on INSS 
MacArthur
 on the expedition to Mote Prime — but the memories dredged up are too much for Bury. Driven by nightmares and a deep-seated fear for humanity's safety, Bury must confirm that the Empire is safe from the Moties. Renner and Bury travel to Sparta, the Imperial capital planet, to obtain permission to inspect the blockade.

In 
Mote
, it is mentioned that a 
protostar
 is forming in the 
Coalsack Nebula
. The Moties had studied it extensively and fooled Jacob Buckman, the astrophysicist on the only expedition to the Motie system, into believing that it would ignite in about 1,000 years. Bury and Renner discover, much to their horror, that the object is due to collapse and ignite much sooner. The newborn star will create one or more new 
Alderson Points
 for interstellar travel, giving the Moties another usable exit from their system. The sole currently existing Alderson Point leads to inside the 
photosphere
 of the supergiant red star Murcheson's Eye, which made the blockade much more practical.

Armed with this alarming knowledge and carrying influential passengers, Renner and Bury depart aboard Bury's ship 
Sinbad
 for New Caledonia, the closest human system to the Mote. There the Imperial Commission decides that ships must be sent to the hitherto ignored star system where the only dangerous Alderson Point will appear. All that can be sent on such short notice are two Imperial warships and 
Sinbad
.

They arrive — just in time to observe seven unarmed Motie ships emerge from the new Alderson Point. The Moties scatter, and three human ships cannot possibly capture all of them, though they can block the exit. Renner and Bury decide they have no choice but to accept a Mediator's invitation to return with her to the Motie system.

The second half of 
The Gripping Hand
 is a tale of shifting alliances involving many Motie factions, diplomacy and space combat. With the aid of the grownup offspring of Lord and Lady Blaine, raised in the company of Mediators brought back by the first expedition, Bury and Renner fight to save the Empire.  Key to their strategy is a 
genetically altered
 parasite developed by the Blaines' research institute. It limits the excessive reproduction rate that has condemned the Moties to Cycles of overpopulation, followed inevitably by war and the collapse of civilization. Two alliances coalesce, one in favor of peaceful co-existence with humans and another determined to escape the Motie system at any cost. The pro-human faction wins."

In 2025 and 2026, after the Gaia-worshipping but environmentally destructive ""Daybreak"" movement unleashed a nanotech plague and nuclear and EMP attacks, the population of Earth has been greatly reduced and forced back to 19th-century or earlier technology. Two regions, one with its capital in 
Seattle, Washington
 and the other with its capital in 
Athens, Georgia
, claim to be continuing the government of the U.S., while semi-independent regions around New York (increasingly fascist), in California (feudal), in Colorado (ostensibly neutral and dedicated to research and communications) and in Texas have some desire to participate in a restored U.S.  Much of the Northeast is inhabited by ""tribals"" who have been mysteriously brainwashed into ""Daybreak"", but in one of their strongholds, Lord Robert is breaking away from the movement.

Despite tensions between the secularist believers in human rights in the Northwest and the 
fundamentalist Christian
 theocrats in the South, most of the regions attempt coordinate in a military campaign against the tribals and build up to a Presidential election to reunify the country.  However, it turns out that the leaders of those regions were tricked into the campaign by Daybreak because it unifies it with Lord Robert.  The U.S. forces are defeated disastrously.  One of the leaders in Colorado makes herself president for the sole purpose of dissolving the United States and resigning.  She and other survivors of the reunification attempt find refuge in California and the West Indies, which may become centers of the drive to rebuild civilization."

From 
New York City
 in 1921, four people sail to 
England
 to meet with Walter Jenkins, the original author of the 
War of the Worlds
 story. Jenkins has seen signs that the Martians may be planning a second attack. They arrive to find 
London
 has become a 
totalitarian
 
dystopia
 and the whole country is gearing up for war. Walter's brother, Frank, is conscripted the next day and London prepares for war. Beginning at 7:00pm, 50 cylinder-shaped Martian missiles land on the city, wiping out nearly half of the 
British Armed Forces
. At midnight, another group of cylinders lands, carrying Martian warriors. The Martians emerge immediately, in contrast to the 19 hours required in their 1907 landings, and engage the British military with their heat rays. Counterattacks by the Army, the Navy and the relatively new Air Force prove mostly harmless against the Martian fighting-machines. Over the next few days, the Martians cripple London, carefully selecting targets of infrastructural importance, such as bridges, factories and railway stations. Many Londoners escape or take shelter.

2 years later in 1923, the Martians control England, though they mostly remain within their cordon. Jenkins asks Julie Elphinstone, his former sister-in-law, to go into the Martian cordon to try to communicate with them. She and her group make the long journey to there, dodging several Martian attacks along the way and meeting a 
saboteur
 named Marriott. At the Martian base, they discover that the Martians are carnivorous, keeping humans and humanoid species in holding tanks for future harvesting. They witness breeding experiments between Martians and humans. Eventually, they come to the feeding hole, where the Martians have humans hung upside-down from scaffolding while they inject the human's blood directly into their Martian bodies.

As the Martians continue to conquer other parts of Earth, Julie comes up with a plan. Knowing that the Martians communicate with their home planet by using 
sigils
 carved into the earth's surface, she wonders whether it would be possible to change the sigils and therefore disrupt communications. Eric Eden, a veteran of the first Martian war, agrees to let her attempt it. Eden transports Julie inside the cordon with his ""landship"", a massive 
tank
-like vehicle the size of a battleship. Julie contacts the saboteur Marriott, who agrees to detonate numerous explosives to change the Martian sigils into the circular 
Jovian
 symbols. Within two hours, the Martians have withdrawn and the Jovians leave their circular sigil on the moon.

The book jumps forward 14 years to 1937. The Martians are still on Earth but no one knows where. Jenkins takes Julie half a mile into the earth to the underground Martian city in England. He speculates that this is how they live on Mars, that they have no secrets because of their telepathy, and that they are all treated as equals. The British Martians built a 
space gun
 and fired themselves back to Mars. 

Reports say that other Martians moved to the Earth's poles where the climate is more Mars-like. Julie, Jenkins, Eden and some others take a massive German 
Zeppelin
 to the Arctic, where they see a Martian 
terraforming
 operation. Jenkins theorizes that, with the Jovians watching, they are forced to colonize rather than conquer, and that humans should work with them instead of against.

When Earth-Mars 
opposition
 comes around again, the Martians do not launch any cylinders. The war of the worlds is over.

In addition to the main storyline, the novel contains various standalone vignettes depicting Martian attacks in New York City, 
Berlin
 and 
Los Angeles

Jilly is struck by a car and becomes paralyzed on her right side. She discovers she can dream herself to the spirit world like her friend Sophie has long known how to do. Her physical body remains in the hospital bed while a dream version of herself, young and not paralyzed, traverses the spirit world. There she meets her friend Joe Crazy Dog, who can travel to the spirit world while awake. He tells her he has sent for a pair of ""crow"" girls who might be able to cure her condition, but only after she deals with emotional wounds from her past.

Somebody breaks into Jilly's studio and destroys many of her paintings. Her friends keep seeing on the streets a woman who looks just like Jilly. They wonder if a 
shadow twin
 might be behind both Jilly's ""accident"" and the vandalism.

Jilly meets in the dreamlands a young man named Toby. He is an 
Eadar
 – a fictional character who acquires a physical presence in the spirit world, but whose existence depends on there being people who believe in him. Together they spend several nights climbing a huge tree to get some magical twigs that may help both of them.

In flashbacks, the book gradually reveals details of Jilly's past. As a child, she was repeatedly raped by her brother Del. She finally ran away from home and by her teens was a junkie and prostitute living on the streets, until a kind cop named Lou found her and brought her to his then girlfriend Angelina, who rehabilitated her.

Back at Jilly's former home, Del turned his attention to her younger sister Raylene, who never forgave Jilly for abandoning her. Raylene slashed Del's leg, and later ran away with her best friend Pinky. To make money, they performed 
badger games
 and ended up killing a dirty cop. Pinky eventually became a porn star, while Raylene started working in a print shop. There she fell in love with one of her coworkers, who taught her how to use computers, but was killed by a robber. Pinky served several years in prison for assault, and during that time she and Raylene began sharing dreams in which they were wolves hunting unicorns.

Raylene learned her sister's whereabouts from an article. On the day of Pinky's release, Raylene bought a pink 
Cadillac
 and the two of them rode off in search of Jilly. That is when Raylene destroyed Jilly's paintings, and continued to stalk her.

In the hospital, Jilly and Sophie discover that they can share their dreams as well, and when they find themselves in a forest, they encounter a pack of wolves, one of whom reminds Jilly of her sister. She realizes that Raylene must be the lookalike who destroyed her paintings.

Raylene is upset that Jilly has now invaded her dreams. She wants to find a way into the dreamlands while awake, so that she can avenge herself on Jilly there. She sees Joe on the street and recognizes him from his 
Don't! Buy! Thai!
 
T-shirt
 as he slips into the spirit world. By watching him, she figures out how to enter the spirit world herself. She and Pinky kidnap the sleeping Jilly and carry her body into the spirit world.

The dreaming version of Jilly has reached the top of the tree and retrieved two twigs, one of which made Toby real, and no longer an Eadar. The other had no effect on Jilly's condition. But because Jilly's physical body has entered the dreamlands, she feels pulled toward it, and she must climb down the tree to reach it.

When she reaches Raylene, they begin talking. Raylene realizes how silly it is to hold a grudge against her sister for something she did when she was a kid just trying to survive. Unfettered, Pinky points her gun at Jilly and fires – but Raylene places herself in the line of fire and dies. Joe arrives at that moment with a pitbull, which kills Pinky.

Toby reaches the clearing with the remaining twig woven into a wreath containing additional herbs, which is powerful enough to cure Jilly's paralysis. Instead, Jilly uses it to bring Raylene back to life. Because Raylene killed many unicorns, she must never return to the dreamlands, or else Joe's friends will hunt her down. The crow girls visit Jilly and tell her that they cannot yet cure her condition, but they give her feathers so that she can call them anytime she wants."

In 1950, twelve-year-old Robert Stephens Jr. lives with his sister Gloria in Gracetown, 
Florida
. Many children in Gracetown are able to sense “
haints
”, an ability they gradually lose with age. The children’s mother has died of cancer. Their father was falsely accused of raping a white woman and has been driven out of town. Robert and Gloria are left in the care of the octogenarian Ms. Lottie.

Robert has a minor scuffle with a white teenager who made advances towards Gloria. Robert is sentenced to six months at the Gracetown School for Boys after a sham trial. The reformatory has a reputation for cruelty; many young men imprisoned there have died in incidents including fires, beatings, and neglect. At the reformatory, Robert sees the ghosts of several young prisoners. Despite this, he is comforted by the spirit of his deceased mother. He befriends Blue and Redbone, two other young inmates. Redbone and Robert are whipped by the sadistic Warden Haddock for discussing escape.

Meanwhile, Gloria and Ms. Lottie hire a lawyer from the 
NAACP
 to appeal Robert’s sentence. In retaliation, the 
KKK
 threatens a majority-Black neighborhood in Gracetown and burns down the Stephens family cabin.

Haddock realizes that Robert can see haints. He asks Robert to help him trap the spirits in exchange for early release. Haddock is concerned that the presence of ghosts will further damage the reformatory’s reputation. Using various hoodoo techniques, Haddock teaches Robert to imprison spirits in the “haint jar”, which is stored in the warden’s office. Haddock orders Robert to catch the ghost of a young man who died in a fire in 1920; Robert realizes that this ghost is his friend Blue. Blue tells Robert that Warden Haddock set the fire that killed Blue and many other boys. They do not want to move to the afterlife until the warden has paid for his crimes. Blue tells Robert that Warden Haddock has pictures of sexual abuse and torture hidden in his desk; he asks Robert to expose the warden.

On visitation day, Gloria and Ms. Lottie pass a plan to Robert: they plan to break him out of the reformatory. Robert plans to escape with Redbone. However, the warden locks up Redbone to punish Robert for failing to catch enough haints. Redbone is then killed by an older boy.

On the day of the escape, Blue sets fire to the kitchens as a distraction. Robert breaks into Haddock’s office, stealing the haint jar and the incriminating photographs. Haddock soon realizes what Robert has done and pursues him. Robert releases the ashes into a creek, freeing the trapped spirits. Blue and the other spirits released from the jar kill Haddock by turning his own hunting dog against him. Robert and Gloria escape to Chicago, where they reunite with their father."

Anthony, the human avatar of Wormwood, receives a message from Home, his native planet. Wormwood is a footholder, a sentient but lesser species than Homians. Footholders require another sentient being, such as a human or Homian, to serve as their host. Home is now uninhabitable; Homians now exist only as digitized copies of their former selves. Homians planned to find Home-like worlds, replace the native fauna with xenoforms, and upload their consciousnesses into these new life forms. The first human has become 100% xenoform, but an attempted consciousness upload has failed. A Homian scientist orders Anthony to investigate. Anthony finds that a Homian species of plant, which disrupts xenoforms, has appeared in Rosewater.

Meanwhile, a woman named Alyssa Sutcliffe awakens to find that she has lost all of her memories. She begins experiencing memories from a Homian consciousness. Aminat extracts Alyssa from a hospital.

Jack Jacques is now the mayor of Rosewater. The Nigerian president attempts to assassinate him. Jacques declares Rosewater an independent city-state. He has a contentious partnership with Femi Alaagomeji, head of S45; Femi instructs him to contact Kaaro for help. Riots disrupt the city. Aminat and Alyssa search for safety. Alyssa grows to like Aminat and to understand more about humans during this journey. Eventually, Kaaro, Alyssa, and Aminat reach the mayor's mansion.

With S45's help, Eric has survived the culling of human sensitives. He is ordered to kill Jacques. Eric bombs Jacques's car; Jacques loses his leg, but survives. Eric escapes Rosewater.

The alien plant begins taking on humanoid shapes and attacking Wormwood's dome. The populace begins referring to the plant creatures as Beynons. Kaaro and Aminat enter the dome. Molara tells them that Anthony is dead and Wormwood is dying; it needs a new host. Kaaro kills the Beynons, and Alyssa becomes the new host for Wormwood. She removes the dome and drives the Nigerian army away from Rosewater, solidifying its status as an independent state. Meanwhile, Jacques has Femi arrested and imprisoned.

The Homians agree to stop replacing living humans. Instead, they will occupy the bodies of reanimates. Thousands of Homians download their consciousnesses into Rosewater, ushering in a new era for humanity and Homians alike."

While walking in the woods near the small town of Haven, Maine, Roberta ""Bobbi"" Anderson, a writer of 
Wild West
-themed fiction, stumbles upon a metal object that turns out to be a protrusion of a long-buried alien spacecraft. Once exposed, the spacecraft begins to release an invisible gas into the atmosphere that gradually transforms people into beings similar to the aliens who populated the ship. The transformation, or ""becoming"", provides them with a limited form of genius which makes them very inventive but does not provide any philosophical or ethical insight into their inventions, and they often do not understand the principles of the inventions (one of them admits, ""We're builders, not understanders""). The spacecraft also prevents those affected by it from leaving town, provokes psychotic violence in some people, and causes the disappearance of a young boy, David Brown, whose older brother Hilly teleports him to the planet referred to as Altair 4 by the Havenites (a reference to 
Forbidden Planet
).

The book's central character is James Eric Gardener, a poet and friend of Bobbi, who goes by the nickname ""Gard"". He is somewhat immune to the ship's effects because of the 
steel plate
 in his head, a souvenir of a teenage skiing accident. Gard is also an alcoholic and is prone to binges that result in violent outbursts followed by lengthy blackouts.

As Bobbi is almost totally overcome by the euphoria of ""becoming"" one with the spacecraft, Gard increasingly sees her health worsen and her sanity disappear. Gard feels he has little to live for aside from his friendship with Bobbi and decides to stay with her to try to halt her decline. He witnesses the transformation of the townspeople, discovers the torture and mutilation of Bobbi's dog Peter, and people being killed or worse when they pry too deeply into the strange events.

Over the course of several weeks, Gard, Bobbi, and others continue to unearth the ship. Bobbi and Gard eventually enter the ship; as they explore the ship, Gard realizes that the ship crashed because the crew was fighting with each other, and that the Tommyknockers have no moral limits to keep them from using living beings as organic batteries. As they leave the ship and return to Bobbi's home, Gard plans to kill Bobbi as he can see she is no longer human. Using a gun, Bobbi forces Gard to swallow a lethal dose of 
Valium
. As they talk, he shields his mind, pulls his own gun out, and shoots Bobbi. As Bobbi dies, she telepathically screams and alerts the townspeople, who then swarm to her home, intent on killing Gard for fear that he intends to harm the ship. Ev Hillman, David and Hilly's grandfather, helps Gard escape into the woods in exchange for saving David Brown from Altair 4.

Gard enters the ship, near death after his struggle with the townspeople. With his last ounce of strength, he activates the ship and telepathically launches it into space. This results in the eventual deaths of nearly all of the changed townspeople, but prevents the possibly disastrous consequences of the ship's influence spreading to the outside world. Very shortly afterward, agents from the 
FBI
, 
CIA
, and ""
The Shop
"" invade Haven and take as many of the Havenites as possible (killing nearly a quarter of the survivors), along with a few of the devices created by the altered people of Haven. In the last pages, David Brown is discovered safe in Hilly Brown's hospital room.

Captain Pausert is a well-intentioned but inexperienced merchant traveler from the planet Nikkeldepain, voyaging solo on the old pirate chaser 
Venture
. While on the planet Porlumma, the captain is moved by sympathy to purchase three young sisters – Maleen (about 14 years old), Goth (9 or 10), and the Leewit (5 or 6) – who had been enslaved while visiting another planet on a jaunt of their own. In getting clear of Porlumma, the 
Venture
 escapes pursuit when the girls desperately use what they call the Sheewash Drive, which enables far faster transit than is possible with primary or secondary space drives available either in or outside the Empire. The girls reveal that they are witches from the planet Karres, with klatha (
psionic
) powers. The girls' powers, but especially the possibility of this incredibly fast drive, draw the unwelcome attention of planets and ships they pass. After taking the three sisters to their homeworld of Karres, the captain attempts to return to his home planet but is stunned when faced with a barrage of criminal charges, many relating to his encounter with the witches and his brief stay on the prohibited planet of Karres; in addition, the planetary government avidly want the suspected new space drive. Captain Pausert escapes the Nikkeldepain police and military with the help of the middle sister, Goth, who had 
stowed away
 on the ship.

The two head for the planet Uldune, formerly a pirate stronghold but now a place to buy anything, where they rebuild the ship and assume new identities in preparation for starting a trading business. The captain also finds himself developing minor klatha powers. The pair run afoul of both the planetary government and the Imperium, including industrial espionage and even kidnapping. Finally the newly renamed 
Evening Bird
 lifts off for the planet Emris via a shorter but far more dangerous route through an area of space called the Chaladoor. Aboard are the captain, Goth, a hired ship-hand named Vezzarn, two paying passengers, the passengers' cargo, and a mystery: the ruler of Uldune, believing that the captain and the girl are both witches, asks them to also transport a frightening rocky mass and the catatonic witch found with it.

All is not as it seems aboard the 
Evening Bird
. Vezzarn and one of the passengers, Hulik do Eldel, are spying and creeping around the ship in an attempt to locate the Drive. Vezzarn, however, uncovers the mystery mass, thereby attracting ominous yellow tendrils of insanity called Worm Weather. The captain is having increasingly odd interactions with an immensely powerful alien presence called a vatch, which seems to be manipulating events and watching with glee. Then the second passenger, Laes Yango, drugs everyone on board and redirects the ship for his purposes: he is actually the leader of a feared fleet of space pirates in the Chaladoor, and he is also after the Sheewash Drive. When the Worm Weather attacks, the vatch decides to interfere and they are able to land the ship on a seemingly deserted red planet. The captain, Goth, Vezzarn, and Hulik defeat Yango and his murderous giant spider-robot before taking off once again for space.

The vatch is delighted in the captain's cleverness, and sends him on the next leg of what it calls a game. As a ghost-like projection, the captain is sent to talk to Cheel, the leader-in-hiding of an enormous interdimensional space ship that has been taken over by its insane computer. The captain learns that the computer wants to conquer all known space, using the Worms as its advance guard, and their only salvation is that mystery mass. The group is reunited when the vatch transports them all to Karres, but 50,000 years in the past. The captain continues to refine his klatha powers, including how to grab and manipulate small amounts of the vatch's black energy. When the Leewit shows up – thrown through space and time by the vatch – Goth and the captain learn that the witches of Karres have attacked the Worm World. The two girls and the captain are transported by the vatch to the mad computer's temple/throne room. There they use their witch powers to destroy the computer and its machine minions. Cheel then emerges to retake the Worm World space ship using the mystery mass, but he has no intention of returning to his home dimension and instead proclaims his intent to conquer all. The vatch is elated by the trick, until the captain hooks and manipulates its energy in order to send the former Worm World back to its own dimension, send himself and the witches back to his ship, and send the ship to its rightful time and place. They arrive on the planet Emris in time to rejoice about the victory with the young witches' parents.

Testing shows that the captain does indeed possess klatha powers: two rare talents for now, with a strong overall capacity for future development. The witches' father recruits the captain as a special 
courier
 for the Empress, with the understanding that Goth accompany him because the witches have 
foreseen it
. The captain and Goth are only hours into their first courier mission when Vezzarn and Hulik enter the control room, admitting that they stowed away and asking to join his crew. When the Leewit suddenly appears – once again thrown through space but by an unknown force this time – the captain can only mutter, ""here we go again!""

The novel is narrated by Victor, a former 
Person Bound to Labor
 ('peeb') who, after escaping the Hard Four, has been forced to work as an undercover agent for U.S. Marshal Bridge, infiltrating and gathering evidence to prosecute fellow escapees and the people and organizations helping peebs escape slavery. If Victor refuses to help, the agent has threatened to return him to the plantation from which he escaped; and he can be tracked by a device implanted in his spine if he tries to run.
[

]


As the novel opens, Victor is tracking down the peeb escapee Jackdaw, whose last known whereabouts have led Victor to 
Indianapolis.
 His trail ends at Saint Anselm's 
Catholic
 Promise, a seemingly derelict community center run by Father Barton. Victor poses as Jim Dirkson, a consultant for Indonesian cell carrier Sulawesi Digital, looking to expand into the United States, seeking to get his wife Gentle out of the Carolina plantation in which she is enslaved and into Little America, a suburb of 
Montreal
 mainly populated by 
African Americans
 in exile.

Victor befriends Martha, a white woman with a mixed-race child, after they are ejected from a hotel for stealing from the breakfast buffet. Eventually, Victor locates Jackdaw, who is revealed to be a freeborn African-American college student named Kevin. He was sent by Barton to infiltrate Garments of the Greater South, Inc., purportedly to expose how they have been illegally selling slave-made goods to the rest of the United States (where such goods are unlawful) through shell companies located in 
Malaysia
. Barton contends that this explosive revelation could bring down slavery, or at least assassinate the credibility of its proponents.

Kevin, however, refuses to give up the location of the 'evidence' unless they also extract a slave girl he had fallen for during his year behind the Fence. In a commotion, after he became enraged at the news that the girl was probably dead, Kevin is shot dead by an Indianapolis police officer who is working with Father Barton. Victor is then coerced by Father Barton to go back to GGSI to retrieve the intel.

Victor deduces something larger is at play and gets Martha to play his 'Missus' through the slavery-embracing Hard Four states so they can investigate GGSI. Martha, for her part, is seeking access to Torchlight; a centralized registry of every Person Bound to Labor in the United States – specifically, she wants to find out what happened to Samson, her son's father. Victor decides to double-cross Father Barton, and makes another deal with Bridge. He does not believe the intelligence being retrieved would make any difference, and decides to use the 
U.S. Marshal Service
 to secure his own freedom. Bridge is compelled to play along after Victor bluffs about the damaging nature of the evidence to the Service.

At the Fence, Victor disguises himself as Martha's slave, endures a dehumanizing inspection by Internal Border and Regulation agents, and the two make their way to Green Hollow, Alabama. In Green Hollow, Victor sends Martha back north and meets up with former peebs who hide out at a sympathetic old white lawyer's mansion; he is accommodated there as he prepares to insert himself into GGSI. 

Martha unexpectedly returns to Victor's side, and they succeed in infiltrating GGSI's HQ, obtaining the intel as well as information on Samson. He and Martha are unexpectedly abducted by 
IMPD
 Officer Cook, one of Father Barton's colleagues from Indianapolis. It turns out that Cook, like Victor, is also an undercover agent for the Marshal Service; he betrays both Father Barton and Victor to secure his own freedom. In the ensuing struggle, Cook is shot dead.

When confronted by Victor, Father Barton reveals that the evidence is much more horrifying: GGSI has been experimenting with the eggs of female slaves to genetically produce a new line of slaves who can be legally classified as non-humans. Victor pretends to co-operate with Barton. Telling Bridge he has the intel, they rendezvous in a makeshift operating tent off of a highway, so his tracking implant can be removed and Bridge can give him a new identity. During the exchange, however, Barton and his comrades ambush Bridge, killing the medical technician he had brought along, and is about to kill Bridge, when Victor says to spare him instead. In gratitude, Bridge removes the implant himself, and Victor passes out, waking up to an empty tent.

The novel ends with the undercover Victor and Martha in Chicago, checking into the HQ of the elevator company that contracts with GGSI - plotting sabotage.

Gabriel, a minor Aristos, runs a group of planets containing societies devoted to artistic pursuits, assisted by his several daimones, each of whom has his or her own personality and special area of interest. Attending oneirochronon parties and composing operas, having sex with both men and women (at one point, he has sex with two women at once—one in physical reality, one in the oneirochronon), he seems to live a leisurely, decadent life.

An elder Ariste, Cressida, warns Gabriel that something is up in a nearby solar system. There appear to be some extra planets in an area which astronomical surveys had said contained none. Cressida is murdered before she can explain more but Gabriel begins to suspect that Saito, the Aristos whose domain is closest to the mystery solar system, is using it for some undisclosed purpose.

Gabriel and some of his advisers leave on a secret mission to the mystery solar system. When they arrive there they discover a horrifying truth: the planets contain life, human life. The most advanced of the planets contains a society similar in nature and technological development to Renaissance Europe. The people here have been left without the guidance and control of an Aristos and are mired in constant warfare and squalor, perishing of diseases which modern technology can easily cure. Someone, presumably Saito, has created human life here and consigned it to perpetual suffering for some unknown reason.

Horrified by the suffering they see, Gabriel and some of his companions travel down to the planet to investigate. Posing as visitors from a distant country they identify a local nobleman whom they believe to be Saito and arrange a confrontation. While they are waiting for their chance to assassinate Saito they see their spaceship, which had been orbiting the planet, destroyed. Their assassination attempt fails when they realize that the nobleman is actually an artificial lifeform. Gabriel and his companions are captured and imprisoned.

It is then that Gabriel is confronted with the truth: the mastermind behind this horrifying experiment is not Saito, but Captain Yuan, the architect of the current galactic civilization, who had long been presumed dead. Yuan explains his motives behind creating new life: the galactic society of the Logarchy has become staid and stultifying. Protected from any danger, the people have stopped improving and have become slaves of the Aristoi. He created this new solar system and the life within it in order to give a new start to humanity and create a society free from the restrictions of the Logarchy.

Yuan, Saito, and Zhenling, an Ariste whom Gabriel had considered an ally and even taken as a lover, then begin a brainwashing program on Gabriel, eventually breaking his will and convincing him to help them with minor duties on their project. Their plan is foiled when a previously hidden sub-personality of Gabriel, that he dubs The Voice, uses his computer privileges to escape.

Gabriel manages to defeat Saito and escape along with his friends. He informs the rest of the Logarchy about what has happened and rallies them to a war footing. The Logarchy's forces swarm into the new solar system to provide humanitarian relief and begin to integrate the societies into the galactic society. As Yuan's secrets are revealed it is also discovered that he had tampered with the examination process which forms the backbone of the Logarchy, promoting people to Aristoi who he believed could help him and keeping others back. Captain Yuan himself has escaped to parts unknown and Gabriel makes it his life's mission to track him down and bring him to justice. As he does so he is warned by Zhenling, now imprisoned, that in doing so he will only fulfill Yuan's plan to shake up the galactic status quo."

John ""Control"" Rodriguez takes over as the new director of the Southern Reach, a government agency formed to manage a coastal region named Area X. The public is led to believe that the region suffered an 
environmental disaster
 and is isolated for safety; in truth, the region has been taken over by an unknown force changing the environment and ecosystem behind a largely impenetrable ""border."" He is a secret operative assigned by the mysterious Central group which oversees the Southern Reach. He comes from a family of operatives: his mother and grandfather are prominent and influential members. Control reports to a handler called ""The Voice"" at Central over phone calls and e-mail.

In his role as director, Control frequently encounters friction with the existing staff to various degrees: in particular, the assistant director Grace Stevenson, who seems to have an emotional attachment to his predecessor. Control methodically sifts through the accumulated data (interviews, photos, videos) and discovers that there have been many more expeditions into Area X than have been disclosed to the public. The all-male eleventh expedition alone had multiple iterations with slightly different control factors similar to a lab experiment, leading to the formation of an all-female twelfth expedition to see how this composition would interact with Area X. The twelfth expedition's biologist was the protagonist of the 
previous novel
, and the expedition's psychologist was, in fact, the previous director of the Southern Reach (whom he replaced), a fact that she did not reveal to the other members of the expedition.

The biologist mysteriously reappears in a vacant lot and is detained by the Southern Reach for debriefing; Control begins interrogating her. Slowly, he begins to empathize with her and understand her interest in the area's ecosystem. However, she is uncooperative, insisting that she is not the biologist and requesting that Control refers to her as Ghost Bird; after initially failing to gain any information about Area X or what happened there, his tactics become increasingly more unconventional.

Control suspects that he is under hypnosis and (correctly) surmises that his handler, ""The Voice,"" is hypnotizing him to steer his investigation. He is able to throw off the effects of hypnosis and work more independently, but this alienates him from Central, and he relies on his mother to protect him from retaliation. Central forcibly removes Ghost Bird from the Southern Reach, as they believe Control has developed an emotional attachment to her.

Control visits the previous director's house and makes discoveries that hint at a connection to Area X. After returning to Southern Reach headquarters, he has an unsettling interaction with one of the scientists in a hidden room. He tries to go to the science division but finds his path blocked by a wall that should not exist and appears to be alive. As he runs upstairs in terror, he sees that the border of Area X is moving, encroaching on the facility and leading with it a replica of the director. Control is the only member of Southern Reach who reacts to this development with alarm, and he abandons the facility as Area X envelops it. Returning home to pack, he encounters his mother and learns more about what has been happening. Control also realizes the director's identity as the little girl in a photo found at the lighthouse in Area X. This completely alters his outlook, as it is now clear that she is somehow profoundly interlinked with the anomaly.

Control also learns that Ghost Bird has escaped Central. Based on his intuition and knowledge of the biologist's background, Control travels to the site of an old field study she had conducted before she came to the Southern Reach, with Central close behind despite his efforts to dodge their agents. Control finally meets Ghost Bird at a remote location where she has unexpectedly created another portal to Area X at the bottom of a pool of water, a gateway that she believes has formed from a ""brightness"" she carried that has run its course through her. She jumps into the pool, and Control, hearing a voice in his head urging him to follow her, also jumps."

 are assigned to handle the Zacuity case alongside Eliasz, a human agent who enjoys the violent aspects of his work. Paladin is indentured to Eliasz and incapable of acting 
autonomously
. While at a shooting range with Paladin, Eliasz becomes aroused. Eliasz berates Paladin using 
homophobic
 slurs after they question him about it, as he perceives Paladin as male and is ashamed by his arousal.

Flashbacks reveal that 30 years ago Jack was in a relationship with Krish Patel, a fellow bioengineer and anti-patent activist, but they had a falling out which led to Jack's turn to piracy. In the present, Jack and Threezed head to Krish's lab in 
Saskatoon
. They pass through 
Yellowknife
, where they meet Med, an autonomous robot who has been independently researching the Zacuity cases. Med joins Jack and Threezed at Krish's lab, where they develop a drug called RetCon intended to be a counteractive to the addictive properties of Zacuity. After publishing RetCon for public use, Med and Threezed find out that it cures Zacuity addiction but people who were addicted for too long become somehow averse to working.

Meanwhile, Eliasz is drugged while undercover at a party in Casablanca, and Eliasz and Paladin have sex. Paladin tells Eliasz that their brain came from a female soldier, and Eliasz begins to refer to Paladin as female. Eliasz travels to Las Vegas and sends Paladin to Vancouver. In order to go undercover in Vancouver's community of autonomous bots, Paladin is given a temporary ""autonomy key"". While autonomous, Paladin examines their own programming and learns that they are programmed to feel a strong sense of attachment to Eliasz.

Eliasz arrives in Vancouver and reconnects with Paladin. Eliasz and Paladin find Krish's lab and confront Krish and Med. Eliasz tortures Krish and kills him after learning Jack's location in 
Moose Jaw
. Jack sets a trap and manages to hold Paladin and Eliasz off long enough for Med and Threezed to arrive. Paladin is gravely wounded in the ensuing fight, and Eliasz has the opportunity to shoot Jack but chooses instead to go back for Paladin.

Jack is officially presumed dead after the firefight. Med publishes her research into Retcon and the drug becomes a widespread treatment for Zacuity addicts. Zaxy conducts a successful PR campaign denying the claims that the black market drug was the same as Zacuity. Paladin recovers from their damage with their autonomy intact but is no longer recognized by the IPC, and Eliasz and Paladin depart together for Mars.

Early in the

, rumors of gold in the 
Klondike
 have brought would-be 
prospectors
 to 
North America
's 
Pacific Northwest
. Anxious 
Russian
 investors commission 
American
 inventor Leviticus Blue to create a machine which can mine through the ice of 
Russian-owned Alaska
. Blue's ""Incredible Bone-Shaking Drill Engine"" (or ""Boneshaker"" for short, named after 
boneshaker
 bicycles of the era), instead destroys several blocks of downtown Seattle and releases a subterranean vein of ""blight gas"" that kills anyone who breathes it and turns some of the corpses into rotters (non-supernatural zombies). A wall is erected to contain the gas within the affected part of the city. Leviticus Blue is nowhere to be found.

Sixteen years later, Leviticus's wife and son, Briar and Zeke (Ezekiel) Wilkes, live in the impoverished outskirts of the former metropolis. Life is difficult, but Briar manages to support herself and Zeke by working a physically demanding 
blue collar
 job cleaning water. One day, Zeke enters the toxic city in search of evidence proving his father is innocent of the intentional destruction.  Briar intends on following, but the drainage hole collapses in an 
earthquake
. She then hitches a ride over the wall by a captain of an airship, the unnaturally tall Captain Cly. Meanwhile, Zeke meets Rudy, a man who claims to be a highly decorated lieutenant. Rudy tells Zeke that he can lead him to his parents' former house. The pair of them encounter a 
Native American
 woman named 
Princess Angeline
 who lightly wounds Rudy, but they manage to elude her.

Briar is attacked by rotters, which causes her to flee to the roof of a building, where she is rescued by Jeremiah Swakhammer and his Doozy Dazer. He takes her to a bar named in honor of her deceased father to meet people including the barkeeper, Lucy O'Gunning. Rotters attack the bar, forcing the occupants to retreat. It is later revealed that a man named Minnericht caused the rotter attack. Lucy takes Briar to see Minnericht, believed by some to be Leviticus Blue. Briar, however, doubts this. Unbeknownst to her, Minnericht has taken Zeke hostage. A battle breaks out between Minnericht's men and Swakhammer, Lucy, and the Indian princess. This battle attracts the rotters, complicating Briar's efforts to reunite with her son and exit the dangerous area of Seattle.

Swakhammer is found unconscious and in critical condition by Briar. She tries to make Minnericht help him, leading to a heated argument in which Briar renounces that he is Leviticus, and mocks him. Unbeknownst to Minnericht, the Indian Princess is behind him, and while Briar distracts him she comes, slits his throat, and kills him in revenge for her daughter Sarah's suicide, which he drove her to (Minnericht was Sarah's husband, making him Angeline's son-in-law).

Everyone reunites and escapes to the surface. Eventually Briar leads Zeke to her and Leviticus' old home and tells Zeke that she killed Leviticus Blue years ago, as he tried to escape Seattle with his Boneshaker. Briar shows her son Blue's mummified body, still inside Boneshaker. Zeke claims he doesn't hold any grudge against his mother for killing her husband, and they embrace, before leaving to loot what is left of the former Blue residence."

Protagonist Jack Holloway lives a solitary life mining valuable ""sunstones"" in the wilderness of the planet Zarathustra, managed by Victor Grego's Chartered Zarathustra Company, which built colonial outposts there and now reaps the benefits of the planet's resources. One day, Holloway meets a small golden-furred humanoid whom he names ""Little Fuzzy"", who soon introduces Holloway to his family. Holloway cares for the Fuzzies and spreads word of their apparently intelligent behavior. When the Company discovers that the Fuzzies' intelligence may qualify them as a sapient species, the Company moves against them, as the discovery of sapient native Zarathustrans would turn the planet into a protected aboriginal zone, install a proper government there, and deprive the Company of its complete control of the planet's resources.

Leonard Kellogg, one of Grego's staff, manages a team of scientists working to legally disprove the Fuzzies' sapience at all costs. Holloway suspects Kellogg's intentions and resists him. When Kellogg kills a Fuzzy in anger, Holloway has him charged with murder, leaving the Fuzzies' sapience to be determined in court. In the midst of the proceedings, it is proven that Fuzzies have at least the mental capacity of a ten-year-old human child and speak to each other ultrasonically. Kellogg kills himself in his cell, but the prosecution continues, and the court officially rules that the Fuzzies are sapient beings, invalidating the company's charter. Holloway and his allies are given Fuzzy-related positions in the new government.



Sequels
[
edit
]


The second book, 
Fuzzy Sapiens
, deals with the newly charterless Zarathustra Company and its gradual cooperation with the planet's new governor to ensure chaos does not take over the planet, while the Fuzzies attach themselves to individual human guardians including members of the Company staff. Victor Grego, one of the villains of the first book and the manager of the CZC, finds a Fuzzy in his private apartment in the Company tower, adopts him, names him Diamond, and become a firm supporter of the Fuzzies. This enables the company to cooperate with the new planetary government headed up by naturalist Ben Rainsford and work with the Native Affairs Commission headed up by Jack Holloway. It becomes clear that criminals are using the irregular status of the government and of the company to attack it and steal sunstones. With the help of the Fuzzies, the thieves are thwarted. There is also further exploration into the biology of the Fuzzies, and it is established that the Fuzzies may be in a biological dead end, doomed to extinction without aid from the humans.

The third book, 
Fuzzy Bones
 by 
William Tuning
, suggests that the remarkable affinity of all Fuzzies for the survival ration ""Extraterrestrial Type Three"" (a.k.a. ""Extee 3"", ""estefee"", or ""hoksu-fusso"", meaning ""wonderful food"") does not coincide with the composition of Zarathustran soil, a contradiction of Garrett's Theorem. A third significant Fuzzy character is developed called Starwatcher. Little Fuzzy, Diamond, and Starwatcher become the clear leaders in working with humans. Among other things, an alien spaceship is discovered on Beta Continent, and evidence that the Fuzzies are not in fact native to Zarathustra  emerges, which raises a variety of legal and philosophical questions. Tuning introduces a number of memorable characters, including Christiana Stone, Grego's Fuzzy-Sitter-in-Chief; Reverend Thomas Aquinas Gordon, aka ""The Rev;"" Master Gunnery Sergeant Philip Helton, TFMC; and Liana Bell, a CZC scientist invited by the researchers of Holloway's Fuzzy Institute to join them in their research.

Golden Dream
 by 
Ardath Mayhar
 fits with these three books in terms of the general plot and relationships. Essentially, it is 
Little Fuzzy
 told from the point of view of the Fuzzies rather than that of the humans.

After these two official sequels, the original third book by Piper himself, 
Fuzzies and Other People
, offers an alternative future wherein Little Fuzzy himself is separated from Jack Holloway and introduces a band of Fuzzies led by Wise One to the combined society. It explores the deepening relationships between the characters already introduced in Piper's first two books, and shows how the Fuzzies fit in with the humans on Zarathustra."

Stephen Huxley returns from service (after recuperating from his war wounds) to see his elder brother Christian, who now lives alone in their childhood home, Oak Lodge, just on the edge of Ryhope Wood. Their father, George, has died recently (their mother, Jennifer, died some years earlier). Christian is disturbed but intrigued by his encounters with one of the mythagos, while Stephen is confused and disbelieving when Christian explains the enigma of the wood. Both had seen mythagos as children, but their father explained them away as travelling

At Martian shipyards on Callisto, a team of soldiers from a radical cell of the OPA steals radar-absorbing stealth coating before destroying the shipyards with an asteroid.

A year later, the 
Rocinante
 is down for long-term maintenance at Tycho station after the events of 
Cibola Burn
. The crew members decide to take care of some personal business during the down time. Amos Burton heads to 
Earth
 when he learns his parent figure there has died, both to pay his formal respects, and to make sure no foul play was involved. Alex Kamal heads to 
Mars
 in the hopes of getting closure with his ex-wife. Naomi Nagata heads to 
Ceres
 station when she receives a message from her former lover Marco Inaros, although she doesn't tell any of her crew-mates why she is leaving.

On Earth, Amos pays respects to his mother figure. Afterwards, Amos goes to visit Clarissa Mao in prison, whom he had grown close to on their journey back from the Slow Zone in 
Abaddon's Gate
.

Jim Holden remains on Tycho and supervises repairs to the 
Rocinante.
 He is approached by documentary producer Monica Stuart to investigate disappearing colony ships headed for the new worlds. Although Stuart is convinced the Protomolecule is responsible, Holden thinks that rogue factions within the OPA are stealing ships and repurposing them. Holden traces one of the disappearing ships to an asteroid cluster near Mars, and forwards the data to Alex to go take a look.

Alex's ex-wife rebuffs his attempts to reconnect, and he instead finds himself working with Bobbie Draper, who takes advantage of his presence to try to investigate missing Martian warships. After they're attacked and nearly killed by an unknown group, they take the 
Razorback
, still in Bobbie's possession after the events of 
Caliban's War
, to investigate the asteroid coordinates Holden sent, where they stumble upon a large fleet of stolen Martian ships.

Meanwhile, on Ceres, it is revealed that Naomi has a son, Filip, with Marco. Naomi spent her youth involved with his radical OPA cell, but left after he tricked her into coding a software override on ship reactors that he used to kill hundreds of Earthers. Marco took Filip from her to attempt to control her, but she managed to escape his cell, and signed on with the 
Canterbury
. Now, years later, Marco's message had claimed that Filip was in trouble to lure Naomi back into his grasp. Marco's forces kidnap Naomi. He explains that he sees the existence of the gates to other solar systems as an existential threat to the Belt, as humanity will not need the Belt's resources with a thousand new planets to exploit. Marco has been stealing Martian ships to take control of the 
Solar System
, creating a fleet he calls the ""Free Navy.""

The Free Navy launches a massive, multi-pronged terror attack across the Solar System. Simultaneously, they launch on attack on Tycho Station (and steal the sole remaining Protomolecule sample), take control of Medina station in the Slow Zone, and attack a convoy transporting the Martian Prime minister. Worst of all, they launch multiple asteroids covered in stealth coating at Earth, devastating the planet and causing an extinction level event. Amos survives the impact event. Working together with Clarissa Mao and former criminal syndicates from his past, he manages to find a ship and escapes the planet.

Alex and Bobby, who had stumbled onto the Free Navy fleet just before they launched their attack, rendezvous with the Martian convoy. Under heavy fire from fake reinforcements that were really Free Navy ships, the Martian prime minister flees on the 
Razorback
 with Alex and Bobby towards Luna.

Meanwhile, Marco reveals his plans to destroy the 
Rocinante
 by sabotaging its reactor, but Naomi manages to send out a broadcast to warn Holden. His plan foiled, Marco instead sends out a ship rigged to explode when the 
Rocinante
 gets close, luring Holden with a fake distress call using Naomi's voice. Naomi fakes her own death, sneaking onto the booby trapped ship instead, and warns the approaching ships of the trap. She is rescued by Alex and Bobbie.

On a desolate planet named the End of Nothing at the edge of the 
galaxy
, a group of robots and their human assistants form the religious institution called Vatican 17. This group is engaged in a secret project to create the ultimate infallible Pope, a supercomputer robot containing all knowledge that can be gathered from this universe and other 
dimensions
.

Some of this information comes from human 
psychics
 called Listeners who can travel mentally to other planets and dimensions. Their experiences are recorded on ""knowledge cubes"" and eventually fed into the Pope. Based on the Pope's interpretation of all knowledge both material and spiritual the robots hope to establish a truly universal religion.

A religious crisis occurs when one of their listeners called Mary claims to have found 
heaven
. The ""theological faction"" of robots petition to have Mary 
canonized
. But another robot faction doubts the authenticity of Mary's heaven. The Vatican fears an end to the search program. Mary is taken ill and cared for by the newcomer Dr. Jason Tennyson. When he arrives on the planet he quickly befriends Jill Roberts, a reporter who wants to write a formal history of the 
Colony
.

While exploring the new planet Tennyson meets Thomas Decker, who is usually accompanied by Whisperer. Whisperer is a member of a species who were native to the planet. He has the ability to speak to Decker and soon finds out that he can communicate 
telepathically
 more easily with Tennyson than with Decker.

Decker tells Tennyson that he thinks he knows where Mary's heaven is. Meanwhile, Decker is murdered by one of the theological faction robots in order to keep its location secret. Tennyson, Jill and Whisperer discover the location of Mary’s heaven from the equation people, aliens from another dimension. They met several unique and strange aliens, including a triad of aliens consisting of a haystack with 13 eyes, a bubble named Smokey and an octopus-like creature in constant motion nicknamed Plopper. To their surprise, they also meet Decker or rather a duplicate of him. Mary's heaven turns out to be a type of center for galactic studies that collects physical samples of life forms from all over the galaxy. Tennyson and the others struggle to get back to Vatican with proof that Mary’s heaven is this galactic library, not the real heaven.

The group is transported back to the End of Nothing, including the triad of aliens, thus providing proof that Mary's heaven is not the real heaven. The 
Cardinals
 in the Vatican accept this evidence and the Search Program is restored.

The bulk of the story is set on the human world of Hwae and its space station. Hwae is an independent system, but its convenient wormhole gates making it a strategically valuable target to the nearby Omkem Federacy and Tyr Siilas systems.

Ingray Aughskold is the adopted daughter of Netano Aughskold, a politically influential figure on Hwae. She and her brother Danach compete to be named Netano’s heir. To prove her worth, Ingray devises a bold plan: she spends her savings to rescue Pahlad Budrakim from a high-security prison on Tyr. Pahlad was arrested for the theft of eir

 family’s “vestiges”. These artifacts are highly valued in Hwae society for their cultural and historical significance. Ingray hopes to recover these vestiges and use them to enhance her political standing. Pahlad assumes the false identity Garal Ket.

Captain Tic Uisine, Ingray’s ride off Tyr Siilas, is detained due to diplomatic pressure from the alien Geck. Uisine is from the Geck homeworld, but wishes to renounce his Geck citizenship and legally identify as human. Uisine angers the Geck ambassador but is released. 

The group returns to Hwae. Police officers arrest Garal for the murder of Excellency Zat, an Omkem Federacy politician. However, evidence soon reveals that Zat was murdered by Hevom, another Omkem citizen. The Omkem government wishes to pin the murder on Garal for political reasons.

Garal reveals that the Budrakim family’s vestiges were all fake; in fact, many vestiges on Hwae are forgeries, a fact that is well-known in other human systems. When Pahlad discovered this and tried to reveal the truth, eir father concocted the lie about the vestiges being stolen and had em imprisoned.

Captain Uisine impersonates the Geck ambassador and asks for Garal to be released into Geck custody. The real ambassador agrees to accept Garal as a Geck citizen. Simultaneously, Hwae arrests Hevom for murdering Zat.

The Omkem Federacy launches an attack on Hwae Station. Netano Aughskold is captured. Ingray exchanges herself for her mother and several other prisoners. With the assistance of Tic Uisine, Ingray sabotages her captors’ attempts to steal vestiges. Ingray is portrayed as a hero by local media. She declines an offer to become her mother’s heir and decides to return home to focus on her own goals, which include reforming the prison system which once held Garal.

 Among their physical and perceptual modifications, they have the ability to control the passage of time, to slow it down to make a hundred years feel like a few weeks, and speed it up to match clock-time. The crew's interest in the planet is that it has a huge 
conical
 structure 142 kilometre high that reaches above the world's atmosphere. It resembles a mountain, but, they conclude, it must have been constructed to support its weight. They name it ""Purgatory Mount"", after 
Dante
's fictional mountain ""Mount Purgatory"" in the 
Divine Comedy
.

In the 2030s in the United States, teenager Otty, and her friends, Gomery, Kath, Cess and Allie communicate with each other via a private internet they built to avoid being spied on by the authorities. California has issued a 
unilateral declaration of independence
 and the country is on the brink of 
civil war
. Otty and Gomery are arrested by Government agents and held at separate facilities where they are interrogated. The authorities want access to the group's network, but the pair refuse to give it to them. War breaks out between the Government and the Freedom Militia and the country quickly degenerates into chaos. Gomery escapes and Otty is released after she is abandoned by her captors. Otty reunites with Allie and learns that they are the sole survivors of their group. It is revealed that Allie is an advanced 
AI
 and it is Allie that the government was after. Otty, devastated at the loss of her friends, lets Allie loose on the internet at large, where it quickly infiltrates and controls all the world's computer systems.

While robots traverse the mountain's terraces, trying to establish what material the edifice is made of, some of the crew travel to the planet's surface to supervise the construction of a power plant. But Pan refuses to participate, stating that Purgatory Mount 
is
 Dante's Mount Purgatory, and that the crew must all 
atone
 for their sins by climbing the mountain. In the book's

In a world with matter being made up of eight different generations of 
leptons
 with each one having twice the mass of the previous one, humans have different sizes organized in seven scales and a Generation Eight currently under research. Every scale has twice the size as their previous scale, hence with Scale One, normal humans, being the largest and Scale Seven, about the size of 
Lego minifigurines
, being the smallest. They mostly separate in their respective district, although cross-scale offspring can happen. Different scales bring unique problems, for example the speed of thought and life expectancy being different or molecules made up of matter of one scale not working for a different scale. Communication inbetween is also difficult since it requires frequency modultation, but there is a universal language known as Panscala. Since for example body volume grows with the third power of the height, there are debates whether resources should be split according to a 
logarithmic
 or 
linear scale
. All of that creates tension between the scales.

Sam Mujrif, a Scale Four detective, is tasked with finding Cara Leon, a Scale One woman, by her sister Jessica Leon. Prior to disappearing, Cara Leon had done trade with electronics in District Four and was also last seen there. Sam Mujrif eventually uncovers that Cara Leon had been kidnapped and made part of an experiment, that kept her underwater in a dome of Scale Seven metal, made with the new technology of lepton engineering. She is saved and reunited with her sister Jessica Leon with her claims hinting that she stumbled upon something she wasn't supposed to see in District Four. Shortly after, a giant blast resembling a 
nuclear explosion
 can be seen all over the different districts and first causes panic. It turns out that District Seven has launched the probe 
Friendship
 around the 
Earth
 and plans to colonize the 
Moon
 and 
Mars
, explaing the experiment with Cara Leon. Although 
Friendship
's orbit is synchronized with the sleep cycles in multiple districts and sends out signals for all scales to see, some people perceive it as a passive-aggressive demonstration of power. It furthermore turns out, that District Seven worked on advancing lepton engineering to be able to transfer genetic information between scales by translating the different analogues of atoms used in their biology into each other. Debates and then a vote are held on the technology, which yields neither victory for or against it, but instead a third option. Sam Mujrif's son tells him to soon going to study in the astronaut program of District Seven, which takes twenty-four students from each district, and not be worried about the common future of the scales.

The story begins on 14 May 2012 as Dr. Shadrach Mordecai, personal physician of the dictator Genghis II Mao IV, awakens. He checks the health of the dictator through a series of implants within his body that link to the general health of his client, allowing him to receive any information on the health of the dictator through codings of various twitches in his own body. Through a series of security checks, he enters into his office to prepare for a kidney transplant for his master.

As he passes Surveillance Vector One, the eye on the world which gives committee members the ability to view all events happening on Earth, he meets Mangu, the prince of the world and viceroy of the committee, a charming man who earns the admiration of all his subjects. Mangu is concerned about the surgery, but Shadrach Mordecai assures the prince that Genghis Mao has grown used to surgeries. Here, Shadrach also reveals to the reader that Mangu was chosen as the subject for Project Avatar, where Genghis Mao will continue to reign in the body of his own son. He also feels sorry for Mangu, since he was tricked by his father into believing that he would inherit the throne. Once in his office, he contacts Nicholas Warhaftig, surgeon of the dictator. Warhaftig orders Shadrach to bring Genghis Mao to the Surgery by 0900. Soon, Genghis Mao himself contacts Shadrach to ask how his health is that day. As Shadrach tells the dictator of his health state, he also informs the dictator of the incoming surgery and its timing. Genghis Mao requests for Shadrach to enter his room and prepare him for the surgery at 0900. We also learn from this conversation that the surgery would give the dictator the fourth liver he is having. Afterwards, Shadrach looks up the leaders of the projects Talos, Phoenix and Avatar, for it is his responsibility as personal physician to the Khan to keep checks on the progress of such projects. First, he contacts Katya Lindman of Project Talos. She reports to Shadrach their progress in coding Genghis Mao's eyelid mannerisms and as Shadrach asks her to continue working on coding his mental processes, she has an apprehensive look but agrees. Next, he contacts Irayne Sarafrazi of Project Phoenix. She talks of her problems with brain cell deterioration and becomes worried as Shadrach presses for her to make further progress in the subject. Lastly, he contacts Nikki Crowfoot of Project Avatar, who is also Shadrach's lover. After she recounts her progress, she arranges a meeting with Shadrach for 0230.

Shadrach reveals to the reader his belief that Project Avatar is far superior to the other two, since Project Talos could only create an automated Genghis Mao which could never live up to the ability of the original while Project Phoenix would constantly be confronted with the problem of brain cell regeneration. Afterwards, he leaves to take Genghis Mao to the Surgery. As Warhaftig and his team operate on the dictator, Shadrach, due to his implants, acts as a ""computer"" for the team, informing them of the health status of the dictator throughout the entire surgical process. During the operation, Shadrach also comments on the calmness and tranquility of the dictator and how he has grown accustomed to constant organ transplants. After the surgery, he prepares to leave with Crowfoot to Karakorum, the playground of the world's ruling class. As they enter Karakorum, Nikki Crowfoot muses about how Shadrach and Genghis Mao are like one entity and compares them to the sculptor and his sculpture, how the actions and health situation of Genghis Mao affect the actions of Shadrach. Nikki Crowfoot decides they ought to go to the transtemporallism tent, where supposedly religious rites are carried out using chemicals to transport a client into a dream-like state where he may witness famous scenes, usually related to Christianity. Shadrach is transported to the scene of the Cotopaxi eruption, where he helplessly watches the civilians die all around him. When he wakes up and leaves the tent, he sees many government members, who greet him. Among them is Roger Buckmaster, who claims that he has gained enlightenment from the transtemporallist experience.

Buckmaster first recounts his dream of the Last Supper and the subsequent betrayal at Gethsemane, and how it taught him to hate evil. Then, he begins insulting Shadrach and blaming him for keeping Genghis Mao alive. Both Shadrach and Buckmaster have a lengthy moral argument, but soon Nikki Crowfoot leaves the tent and they leave the area, with Buckmaster shouting curses to Shadrach. Shadrach and Nikki book a room and sleep together, after which they encounter Bela Horthy and Donna Lambile, two members of the government.

Mangu is giving a speech about the worldwide distribution of Rondevic's Antidote against organ rot, to which Bela Horthy yells curses that Genghis Mao constantly lies about healing the world from the organ rot disease, despite the desperate urgings of Lambile. The next day, Shadrach awakes feeling tremendous vigorous twitches from the implants and immediately rushes to meet the Khan. There, he sees many government members surrounding the dictator. He learns from Ionigylakis, the Vice President, that Mangu was assassinated. He soon realises that the twitches were due to the shock from Genghis Mao when he received the news. He also learns that Bela Horthy was the one who witnesses Mangu falling from his window before he informed the Khan. Genghis Mao gives Avogadro, the security chief, orders for subsequent arrests and sentences against suspected individuals in order to invoke fear into the population.

In Committee Vector One, Shadrach has a brief conversation with Avogadro, who states that no one, not even Bela Horthy, saw any assassins throw Mangu out of the window, thus many government members believe it was merely suicide, but Genghis Mao remains convinced that Mangu was killed. Shadrach then asks Bela Horthy about the exact recount he gave to Genghis Mao. At first, Horthy is apprehensive but soon replies that he merely stated that Mangu had died and nothing else. Shadrach also learns from Horthy that Buckmaster has become a prime suspect in the assassination case due to his words of folly at Karakorum the previous night. Shadrach asks Horthy about his own words at Karakorum, but Horthy insists that he was not at Karakorum at all. Meanwhile, the committee members are in chaos as General Gonchigdorge struggles anxiously to find possible suspects and Surveillance Vector One. As the general calls for Frank Ficifolia, Ficifolia reveals to Shadrach his opinion that the committee members have gone mad and that Mangu had probably committed suicide. Shadrach returns to his room, where he sees Nikki Crowfoot. He recounts to her the incidents that occurred and Crowfoot is immediately shocked since her project is affected by the death of the chosen subject. As she listens to the subsequent events, she comments that Bela Horthy probably intended for Genghis Mao to feel great shock due to his testimony and perish. Shadrach returns to his office where he receives a call from Katya Lindman, who requests that he review her progress on Project Talos. She shows the robot of Genghis Mao and all its actions and becomes angry when Shadrach does not seem impressed. As she continues to show Shadrach all her equipment, Shadrach begins to suspect that she has feelings for him.

Later on, he receives a call from Avogadro to participate in his interrogation of Buckmaster. During the interrogation, Buckmaster constantly defends himself, saying that he was drugged from the transtemporallism. Avogadro is shocked that Shadrach also attempts to defend Buckmaster, but more passively. However, in the end, Buckmaster is arrested on the basis of a faulty ""I'll destroy him"" while he was arguing with Shadrach at Karakorum. Shadrach then argues with Avogadro, saying that it was not justified to arrest a man he knew was innocent. However, Avogadro is apathetic to the plight of Buckmaster and even uses Shadrach's words at Karakorum against him that ""guilt is a luxury we cannot afford"". They both assume that Buckmaster is being sent to the Organ Farms, where his organs would be used to support the dictator.  The next day, Shadrach visits Genghis Mao, who speaks deliriously and even offers to make Shadrach pope in Rome. Shadrach infers that Genghis Mao has gone mad over the death of Mangu. That night, he goes to Karakorum with Katya Lindman, where they try dream-death, an experience where one is placed in a dream-like state and imagines death and the subsequent afterlife. Shadrach travels the afterlife realm with Katya in his dreams, and after enjoying themselves, to enters into a tranquil state before awaking. Katya reveals that she was having a different dream from him, one which was not as light-hearted as his. Then, they return home to rest, where Katya randomly and suddenly warns Shadrach to be careful. Nikki Crowfoot grows increasingly distant from him, and Shadrach is unable to discover why. He visits Genghis Mao and informs the dictator of an aneurysm he detected in the dictator's abdominal aorta. The news annoys Genghis Mao, since he is preparing a colossal funeral for Mangu which he refuses to delay. Shadrach has lunch with Katya, who reveals to him that, on the night before his death, she informed Mangu that he was chosen as the Avatar subject. Katya tells Shadrach that she did so only out of sympathy for Mangu, but Shadrach suspects that she wanted to kill the Avatar subject so that her project could supersede Nikki's and hopefully destroy her relationship with Shadrach so she could have him too. However, he soon realises that his suspicions contradict Katya's decision to reveal this information to him. Shadrach hopes to visit Nikki and after learning that she had fallen ill, makes the decision to visit her in her room. There, he pretends to examine her but subsequently asks about her project, to which she responds angrily, ranting about the setbacks in her work. As Shadrach leaves, he also reveals to Nikki that a member of Project Talos informed Mangu that he had been chosen as the Avatar subject, but he disguises it as a rumour. However, Nikki believes it and instantly suspects Katya Lindman to be the culprit. Later, Shadrach confesses to Katya what he had revealed to Nikki. Katya is disturbed at first, but soon informs Shadrach that he had been chosen as the next Avatar subject. Shadrach soon realises that that had to be the reason Nikki had chosen to distance herself from him. Katya advises Shadrach to make a plan of escape and also tells him not to trust Nikki anymore, since she must have agreed to continue her work despite the fact that he was chosen. The day of the aorta transplant arrives. During the surgeries, Shadrach thinks to himself that if he killed Genghis Mao on the operating table, Project Avatar would be finished. He muses about plans such as jostling Warhaftig's elbow or feeding them misleading information, but resolves not to.

In his office, Shadrach begins thinking about Genghis Mao's possible origins and begins crafting fake diary entries from the perspective of Genghis Mao in his mind. Soon, he decides to confront Nikki Crowfoot about him being the Avatar subject. Nikki is shocked and somewhat remorseful, but she defends herself, saying there was nothing she could do. Shadrach is distraught, but lets the matter rest. He resorts to carpentry to cope with the stress. On one of his adventures to the carpentry chapel, he meets Frank Ficifolia, who offers Shadrach the chance to escape from Ulan Bator and remain hidden. Ficifolia also reveals that members of the government helped to conceal Buckmaster, who is still alive, and offers to do the same for Shadrach. However, Shadrach is unsure and asks for time to think. Then, he is approached by Bela Horthy, who advises Shadrach to take the offer and flee from Ulan Bator, but Shadrach continues to refuse. He makes a visit to the Project Avatar laboratory to meet Nikki Crowfoot. After a tour of the laboratory, Nikki takes him to her office. She advises Shadrach to flee from Ulan Bator, even at the expense of her work. However, Shadrach still wants more time to think, to which Nikki responds that she loves him still. Soon, Shadrach decides to go on a vacation so that he would think better overseas. He informs Genghis Mao about his decision, who is slightly disappointed but agrees. Shadrach first goes to Nairobi, where he meets Bhishma Das, a merchant. Bhishma Das constantly asks him questions about the organ rot disease and the Roncevic's Antidote. As they continue their conversation, Shadrach begins speaking of utopian ideals that, after many years, the world will rebuild itself. Although he is unsure of this prophecy, under the encouragement of Bhishma Das, he becomes convinced that that will eventually happen. This gives him encouragement to deal with the problem of Project Avatar. He then leaves for Jerusalem, where he meets Meshach Yakov at the Wailing Wall. Shadrach is distressed about the widespread organ rot and poverty amongst the people, including children, and he prays. Meshach takes Shadrach to his house, where he and his family chat with Shadrach about politics. He then goes to Istanbul, Rome and San Francisco. In each place, he is constantly distressed by the suffering of the people but also begins to suspect that the Citpols, policemen of the Genghis Mao regime, are spying on him.

At San Francisco, he meets an old friend, Jim Ehrenreich, who is struck with organ rot and requests that Shadrach steal some of Rondevic's Antidote for him. However, Shadrach refuses, saying that the antidote only immunises and cannot cure. At first, Ehrenreich is angry but after a while, he accepts his fate. At Peking, Shadrach begins to feel strange twitches in his implants and after a series of checks begins to suspect clogging of cerebrospinal fluid. He rushes to the airport, hoping to get a quick flight back to Ulan Bator. At the airport, he meets Avogadro, who informs Shadrach of the multiple headaches suffered by Genghis Mao and that he requested for Shadrach's return to the capital. Shadrach returns to the capital and visits Genghis Mao, informing his master of the problem and suggests that it be cured by brain surgery: more specifically, to implant valved tubes to his skull to drain the excess fluid. Afterwards, Shadrach arranges a meeting with Frank Ficifolia, requesting to meet Buckmaster. Although Ficifolia is annoyed that Shadrach chose to return when he could have escaped the capital, Shadrach reassures him that he has a plan. Ficifolia agrees to arrange the meeting. Shadrach is taken to the transtemporallists in Karakorum, where Buckmaster has hidden himself as an ascetic, entering multiple dreams to witness the life of Jesus. Shadrach requests for Buckmaster to create a device that will allow him to control the valve that will be implanted into Genghis Mao, and after much persuasion, Buckmaster agrees.

In Ulan Bator, he arranges a meeting with Katya Lindman. Both of them talk about the funeral of Mangu, which he missed while he was on holiday. He also informs her about his cure for the headaches of Genghis Mao, and despite the warnings of Katya, Shadrach states that he has a plan to save himself. Soon, Genghis Mao is operated on and the valved tubes transplanted. He then meets Nikki Crowfoot, who informs him of her progress in Project Avatar. She adds that she hopes her project will not be chosen, but Shadrach tells her not to worry about him but to focus on her work instead. To rest, he leaves again for Karakorum unaccompanied and visits the dream-death tent, where he enters the afterlife and heals numerous people in the dream. He is hailed as their Saviour but is soon interrupted by the scene of Katya informing him that he was chosen as the Avatar subject. Shocked, he awakens and returns to Ulaanbaatar. Already implanted with the device to control the valved tubes, Shadrach visits Genghis Mao and informs him of how he is able to control the tubes using the device implanted in his hand and whenever he clenches his fist, the tubes will reverse, quickly killing the dictator. Instead of begging or becoming angry, Genghis Mao is pleased and informs Shadrach that he was never going to become the Avatar subject in the first place. He also admires Shadrach's shrewdness in dealing with the situation. Shadrach demands to become a committee member in charge of public health to oversee the production and worldwide distribution of Roncevic's Antidote. Genghis Mao agrees and, confused about the dictator's reactions, Shadrach leaves the room to admire the outside world."

Joe Cube is a high tech executive waiting for his company's 
IPO
. On the New Year's Eve before the new millennium, trying to impress his wife Jena, he brings home a prototype of his company's new product (a TV screen that turns standard television broadcasting into a 3D image). It brings no warmth to their cooling marriage, but it does attract the attention of somebody else. Joe is suddenly contacted by a Momo, a woman from the

Charlie Fitzer, ex-business reporter, spouse, and caregiver to his now-deceased father, is in reduced circumstances. Now living with his cats Hera and Persephone in the old family home co-owned with his half-siblings who are keen to sell it, he barely makes a living as a substitute teacher. He aspires to acquire a revered local tavern whose owner is retiring but is denied a bank loan.

When his long-estranged uncle Jake Baldwin, billionaire owner of a parking lot empire, dies, Jake's assistant Mathilda Morrison approaches Charlie with a proposition: represent Jake at the memorial service, and he will receive enough money from the estate to buy out his siblings, get his loan, and realize his dream.

The funeral is attended by various dubious individuals who have a bizarre obsession with confirming Jake's death; one attendee, Tobias, even attempts to stab the corpse. Afterwards, Charlie's house is destroyed by a bomb. An intruder, later found to be a government agent, is blown up with it, and Charlie is framed for the deed. Mathilda and Charlie's cats reveal that Jake's parking lot holdings were a front for his real career as a 
supervillain
. Mathilda was his chief assistant, and cats Hera and Persephone are genetically modified super-intelligent spy cats, who had long kept watch on Charlie for Jake. Moreover, Jake had enemies, who are now Charlie's enemies: the Lombardy Convocation, an organization of rival villains with whom he has long fought a private war.

Charlie, Mathilda and the cats take refuge on Saint Genevieve, Jake's 
Caribbean
 island hideout in 
Grenada
, powered by 
geothermal energy
 from an active 
volcano
 and guarded by intelligent 
dolphins
. Charlie's companions brief him in preparation for an unavoidable meeting with the Lombardy Convocation at the 
Grand Bellagio Hotel
 on 
Lake Como
, Italy. There he is pressured to join and pay a substantial membership fee or face severe consequences. However, a private meeting with Anton Dobrev, head of the Convocation, ends up with the latter apparently dead, the hotel burned, and Charlie once again being framed.

Back at St. Genevieve, Charlie and his allies prepare for the inevitable showdown. He retaliates for an attack on the island by Roberto Gratas, the new head of the Convocation, by destroying his enemies' 
spy satellite
 with a 
space laser
, severing their communications with a pod of genetically enhanced 
whales
 used to attack the island. An apparent accommodation is reached: Charlie agrees to hand over 
Nazi war plunder
 stored by Jake in exchange for peace. The plan takes a turn during the meeting to access the treasure when Gratas betrays his associates and kills them. However, the cache is discovered to be empty, and Gratas's retaliatory efforts against Charlie's staff are foiled. Charlie's dolphins, having pledged allegiance to him after settling a strike on terms favorable to them, suborn the enemy whales. Gratas attempts to eliminate Charlie but is stopped and taken out by the dolphins.

Concluding that he is unsuited for a life of villainy, Charlie learns he was a 
stalking horse
 in a plot by Jake, his allegedly deceased ally Anton Dobrev, and Mathilda to dismantle the Convocation. As part of his exit, Charlie is exonerated, awarded a safe house for his cats, gains ownership of the tavern, and is eventually reunited with his cats, who also retire from the supervillain business."

DryCo has sent two operatives, retired 
African-American
 general Luther and his white bodyguard Jake, to 
post-communist
 
Moscow
, where rival 
multinational corporation
 Krasnaya dominates Russian society through consumer capitalist mass production of products. However, Luther and Jake discover that Krasnaya has two highly advanced 
quantum physicists
 under duress, Oktobriana Osipova and Alekine. The two Dryco mercenaries manage to abduct Oktobriana, but their escape sends them back to 1939 in a 
conservative
 alternate history.

In this world, 
Abraham Lincoln
 was 
killed
 by a 
Baltimore
 pro-
slavery
 mob in 1861 CE, so the 
American Civil War
 never happened, and 
Theodore Roosevelt
 abolished 
slavery
 in 1907 due to European pressure on 
J.P. Morgan
, who feared loss of his European financial assets. On February 15, 1933, 
Giuseppe Zangara
 assassinated 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt
, and 
Winston Churchill
 died from a car accident in 1931. As a result of Roosevelt's premature death, it is noted that 
John Nance Garner
 proved to be a 
fiscal conservative
, leading to a situation where much of the western United States had to threaten civil war to obtain economic relief from the ongoing 
Depression
. As the novel progresses, Alekhine, actually a Krasnaya operative, abducts 
Joseph Stalin
 from 
Moscow
, to be transferred to Krasnaya custody and kept in a 
dacha
, in a future which has abandoned 
communism
 and uses the image of ""
Big Boy
"" as nostalgic consumer iconography.

When this world eventually does undergo its 
World War II
, it is assumed that there will be no effective opposition to 
Nazi Germany
 from its 
Soviet Union
 or 
United Kingdom
 as a result. However, as is disclosed in the novel's sequel, 
Elvissey
, this is an incorrect assumption.

Luther and Jake make the acquaintance of Norman Quarles, an 
African American
 doctor and his wife, Wanda,  but their presence attracts the suspicions of (unseen) 
J. Edgar Hoover
, who sends 
FBI
 agents in pursuit. During the chase, Norman is killed, and Oktobriana contracts Dovlatov's Syndrome, a mutated 
influenza
 virus that emerged in 
Irkutsk
, 
Siberia
 in 1909, and led to the deaths of 
Queen Alexandra
, US House Speaker 
William Dean Howells
, 
Charlie Chaplin
, 
Christy Mathewson
, French Premier 
Clemenceau
, 
Claude Debussy
, 
Guillaume Apollinaire
 and 
Amedeo Modigliani
, amongst others, during the ten year space of this epidemic. Ultimately, Luther and Wanda return to Dryco's future, while Oktobriana and Jake are lost in the interdimensional void. Luther and Wanda spend the rest of their lives together, with a coda that takes place several decades later, just after her death.

As an aside, Luther notes that there are sects described as the  
Albigensian
 Church of Jesus the Light, Reformed and the 
Valentinian
 House of God in this world, which implies the survival of 
gnosticism
 has occurred in this timeline. Amongst the books cited in the 
Albigensian
 
Bible
 are the 
Gospel of Matthew
, 
Gospel of Mark
, 
Gospel of Luke
 and the 
Acts of the Apostles
, but this gnostic bible also includes the 
Gospel of Thomas
, 
Gospel of Truth
, and the 
Hymn of Light
. The latter revelation will play an important role in Womack's next novel, 
Elvissey

The story begins with the emergence from 
pupation
 of the protagonist, Flora 717, who faces prejudice and abuse throughout the story on account of her despised status. She is, however, larger and darker than most Flora, and born able to speak. For these reasons, the fertility police plan to kill her, but a cold and rainy summer has left the hive short-handed, and the priestess Sister Sage intervenes to save the talented heroine. Sister Sage sets Flora 717 to work in the nursery, feeding 
royal jelly
 (referred to by the bees as ""flow"") to the larvae. There Flora witnesses the fertility police destroying eggs laid by any bee other than the Queen, as well as any bee suspected of laying those eggs. Refusing to co-operate with the fertility police, Flora is threatened with execution but again saved by Sister Sage, who sends her to work in Sanitation. In this role, Flora encounters various areas of the hive (such as the Fanning Hall, where 
nectar
 is reduced into 
honey
) and sections of hive society (such as the drones, who are entitled, demanding, adored by the sisters, and given to sexual harassment; Flora narrowly avoids being raped). Flora's work as a corpse-bearer takes her out of the hive for the first time.

Flora takes a central role in killing an attacking wasp and is rewarded with an audience with the Queen. The Queen's ladies in waiting take Flora to the Holy Library, a hexagonal chamber the scents of whose walls contain six key chapters in the collective memory of the hive. Flora gets to read its scent panels, learning of predators outside the hive, ""the Kindness"" (the practice of killing infirm, deviant, or elderly bees), what the reader recognises as the robbery of honey by humans, and other phenomena which she struggles to comprehend. Flora learns that the Queen is not in good health, before being chased away by the ladies in waiting.

Hurt by her separation from the Queen and finding herself unable to participate in Devotion, Flora aspires to become a forager. Before she does, disaster strikes the foragers when they collect pollen from a field of 
rape
 that has been doused with pesticide, bringing illness and polluted food into the hive. The venerable forager Lily 500, who had signalled this food source to other foragers before the pesticide was sprayed, is unfairly killed by the fertility police, but before her death she is able to transmit her store of foraging data to Flora.

At this point, the story begins to alternate between two aspects of Flora's life. To her own surprise, Flora lays an egg, experiencing maternal affection despite knowing that it is forbidden; this is followed later in the book by a second and then a third egg. One thread of the narrative therefore concerns Flora's efforts to bring an offspring to pupation. Flora tries to enable the birth of her first offspring by sneaking the egg into the nursery. This is found and destroyed by the fertility police, and Flora witnesses another bee being killed on suspicion of laying it. Learning to make beeswax to form a cradle, she finds a hidden place in which to lay her second egg, but it is destroyed when the hive's human cultivator intrudes at the end of the season to remove honeycomb.

Shortly after laying her first egg, Flora is required to become a forager due to the poor summer, the loss of foragers to pesticide, and her acquisition of Lily 500's data. The second thread of the narrative, then, concerns Flora's foraging expeditions. She is very successful and frequently shows other foragers how to find food by performing 
waggle dances
. Flora's foraging expeditions see her fleeing crows, escaping a trap laid by wasps, colliding with a mobile phone mast, receiving prophetic wisdom from spiders, and exploring a conservatory.

As winter closes in, the sister bees, following the instructions of the Hive Mind, slaughter those drones that have not successfully mated outside the hive and then form a 
winter cluster
. Flora discovers that the least obnoxious drone, Sir Linden, has survived the cull, injured, and enables him to hide in the cluster and survive. The cluster is briefly disturbed by the incursion of a mouse, which the bees kill and embalm in 
propolis
.

As winter goes on, evidence that the Queen is seriously ill grows, and as spring begins Flora identifies that the Queen is a source of sickness in the hive. The fertility police have a Thistle execute the Queen, and the hive moves into a period of internal strife. Flora lays her third egg and this time successfully hides it and brings it to pupation. Sister Sage realises that Flora has given birth, but Flora kills her, disposing of the body with the help of Sir Linden.

As the disorder in the hive grows, several ""princesses"" (
virgin queens
) are born to different kin and begin to fight to the death. A Sage princess is winning until Flora's child, who turns out also to be a princess, emerges and kills her to become the new Queen. Immediately after, the hive faces an unstoppable attack by wasps, and Flora helps her daughter lead the colony in a 
swarm
; her daughter mates with Sir Linden; and they find a new home, in a hollow in a beech tree. Flora's life implicitly ends at this point."

Karl P. Cohen
 becomes involved in the

 to help with the

 for the US 
atomic bomb
 program. Cohen and 
Harold Urey
 investigate using 
centrifugal separation
, a process they had developed, but continued mechanical breakdowns cast doubt on its viability. In 
The Berlin Project
'
s alternate timeline, Cohen persists with the 
centrifuges
, and after obtaining private funding and the backing of high-profile people, including 
Albert Einstein
, the problems are resolved and centrifugal separation is chosen as the method of enriching uranium. In mid-1944, the atomic bomb is finished and ready for deployment.

After much debate, the decision is made to drop the bomb on Berlin on the day of the 
Normandy landings
 in June 1944. The plan is to kill Hitler in his underground bunker, and to assist the 
Allied invasion of Europe
. But while thousands are killed in Berlin, the bombing of the capital has far less of an impact on Germany than was expected. Hitler was not in Berlin at the time, and he continues to assert his authority. The Allies' advance through France is hampered by a new tactic deployed by Germany. Using newly developed 
jet aircraft
, the 
Luftwaffe
 begins dropping 
radioactive dust
 obtained from unrefined uranium on the troops. A growing concern is how advanced the Nazi bomb program is, and the fear that 
Wernher von Braun

nuclear warheads
.

In August 1944, Cohen and 
US Strategic Services
 agent 
Moe Berg
 travel to Switzerland for a secret meeting with German physicist 
Werner Heisenberg
 to establish the progress of Germany's atomic bomb project. Heisenberg admits that Germany has no bomb program, but tells them that the idea of deploying radioactive dust came from von Braun, who had read about it in a science fiction short story.

America completes a second atomic bomb, but it is not dropped on Hitler's bunker. Instead, conventional bombs are used and the dictator is killed. The German army takes over the country and 
field marshal
 
Erwin Rommel
 forms a Provisional Government and surrenders to the Western Allies. Germany steps up its war against the Soviets, and using V-2s and radioactive dust, keeps them out of Eastern Europe. The Americans bring the war against Japan to quick end in early 1945 by dropping

Riemann surface of the logarithm


Del lives in a world, in which a loop around its center with crossing a hoop at its edge doesn't lead back to the original point, but instead a new segment with a new sky. (On the cover, this is illustrated with a spiral, which in mathematics does indeed arise from the 
Riemann surface
 of the 
logarithm
.) All skies have been mapped by the ancient civilization of the Tolleans in the titular 
Book of All Skies
, a copy of which Del and other archeologists bring into a museum in their home city Apasa. At night, Orsino steals the book, after which Del chases after him across multiple hoops. Orsino reveals to have been paid more by someone else and can get rid of Del by injuring her knee with a thrown stone. In Apasa, no money is promised for an arrest, to not give Orsino and those who hired him any satisfsction, but it is instead used for an own cartography of the skies. Del joins an expedition to the last hoop, after which there is only void. Measurements of 
gravity
 have unveiled that there must be land across the void. A bridge build across the void collapses, leaving Del and Imogen cut off from their group on the other side. Both encounter the indigenous people of the other side and learn their language as well as about the new world called Jierra, which turns out to be a planet orbiting around a star. Del and Imogen are unfamiliar with many concepts, like a day or a year, since the Hoops are in total darkness with their people having evolved to have 
infrared
 vision. They learn from the indigenous people that the Hoops were artificially created on Old Jierra as an alternative to 
interstellar travel
 to create more living space. A fatal accident that also destroyed Old Jierra flooded them with 
lava
, cutting off the inhabitants within from the outside world. Any survivors who had already colonized other worlds in their system like Marrikh only returned to Jierra later. Subtle hints like the red color of Marrikh and a gas giant with 
four large moons
 in the system reveal that the story is actually set in the future of humanity, living on 
Terra
 and 
Mars
. Del and Imogen return into the Hoops with the help of three ballons build by the inhabitants of Jierra. Since they are seen as a threat upon landing, they get shot, but manage to get down safely. Del then once again chases a traitor, who had sabotaged their mission by making the bridge crash and might be from the same group as Orsino, that turned out to try to prevent any contact between the two parts of humanity. She then proudly declares, that there won't be any separation any longer.

Yeine Darr was born to Kinneth Arameri, who was heir to the Arameri throne but abdicated twenty years before the start of the story to marry Yeine's father, a Darre man. Kinneth was disowned by Dekarta (patriarch of the ruling Arameri family), and Darr blacklisted by the Arameri (throwing the country into a crippling economic crisis) as a result.

The day she arrives, she meets T'vril, the palace steward, who is also an Arameri (although lower-ranked); the entire palace staff down to the floor cleaning servants is Arameri. This is because only Arameri are permitted to pass a night in Sky, for reasons that T'vril does not immediately explain.  T'vril attempts to get Yeine to Viraine—the palace scrivener—to be ""marked"" as an Arameri before nightfall.  However, Scimina, one of the other potential heirs, finds them first.  Because Yeine lacks the mark, she unleashes Nahadoth, one of the Arameri's captive gods, on Yeine.

Yeine flees and is assisted by Sieh, another of the captive gods.  Before they can escape, Nahadoth catches up and attacks Sieh, whereupon Yeine stabs Nahadoth to apparent death with her knife.  Nahadoth kisses her before he falls, saying he has been waiting for her, much to Yeine's confusion.  Being a god, Nahadoth returns to life shortly afterward.  Yeine then meets the other gods—and quickly realizes that they, like the Arameri, have frightening plans for her.

Yeine, however, has her own agenda:  still in mourning, she has come to Sky to determine who may have killed her mother before the start of the story. While attempting to forge an alliance with Relad, her cousin and the other potential heir, she also seeks out answers to the mystery of her mother's past.  This leads Yeine to terrifying revelations about herself, her world's history, and the gods themselves.

As the day of the succession ceremony approaches and Yeine finds herself left with few options, she chooses to ally with the Enefadeh—even though Nahadoth warns her that they want her life in exchange for their assistance.  Determined to learn the truth about her mother even if she dies in the process, she agrees to the gods' bargain.  She also begins brief liaisons with first T'vril, then Nahadoth himself, the latter of whom seems equally drawn to her, though his motives are unclear.

The story culminates with the Arameri Ceremony of the Succession, at which Itempas himself—the Skyfather, ruler of the universe—appears, and Yeine makes a fateful choice."

Dana Mills wakes up unsure of what has happened to her or why she is pregnant. She knows she is a member of the 
marines
. She is interrogated and ends up in a mental hospital from which she escapes. She ends up near Herot Hall, a development built on top of the town where she used to live. She hides inside the mountain behind it, which has an abandoned train station and a lake; people think it is haunted. In it she gives birth to her son, Gren.

Despite his mother's instructions, as Gren grows older he wishes to meet the people in Herot and becomes friends with Dylan, a young boy in the town. Willa, Dylan's mother, is introduced. Her mother, Diane, forced her into a marriage with Roger Herot, a plastic surgeon and heir of the Herot development. She acts as the perfect housewife (hiding alcoholism, a likely eating disorder, an unhappy marriage, and copious quantities of stress) and quickly notices something is amiss when Dylan begins to talk about his ""imaginary"" friend Gren. At a disastrous house party Dana appears searching for her son who has run down to play with Dylan. Dylan runs away with Gren as Roger follows them toward the mountain. Roger shoots a bear, thinking it is what took Dylan, but Dana believes that he has shot Gren, and so she murders Roger in retaliation. Following this, police officer Ben Woolf goes searching for Dylan. He finds Dylan, and Dana's severed arm, but he claims he killed Dana and Gren. He is acclaimed as a hero and Willa marries Ben.

Years later, Dylan runs away from the boarding school he has been placed in due to rebellious behaviors to find Gren. Dana, who has been slipping further from reality, argues that the people of Herot are evil – they dug into the mountain and disturbed a graveyard where her mother was buried, turning it into a railway station and creating a museum full of her family's bones and belongings. Gren argues that Dylan was good and finally leaves, going to look for him. They meet and kiss but are found by Ben and, running back to his childhood home, Dylan is brutally stabbed and murdered by Willa. Gren vows for revenge and reconciles with Dana; together they attack Ben at Dylan's funeral. Gren is killed by Ben; everyone realizes he is a boy, not a monster. Dana kills Ben, committing suicide in the process. As Willa is put in handcuffs, she realizes all the people of Herot Hall are monsters."

Prior to the beginning of the story, humanity has been expelled from Earth by powerful aliens known as ""the Invaders"", and scattered across eight planets and satellites of the 
Solar System
, the so-called 
Eight Worlds
. The Invaders originate from a 
gas giant
 planet, and have occupied 
Jupiter
, forbidding human access to it. Human expansion to the Eight Worlds has been aided by a broadcast of information from outside the Solar System, named ""The Ophiuchi hotline"" after the constellation 
Ophiuchus
 from which it appears to originate. The information received from this includes extensive material on biological modification, and while sex changes and other modifications have become routine surgeries, experimentation with human DNA remains taboo and forbidden on penalty of death. Related to this, while technology has been developed to allow people to back-up their memories, this is only permitted for implantation within a cloned body in case of death. Due to resource scarcity, only one clone of a person is allowed to exist at any one time, and, similarly, reproduction is restricted to one child per person. An exception exists for those people who join the artificially-created symbionts that can live openly in the vacuum of space.

The protagonist, Lilo, has experimented with human DNA and, when discovered, is sentenced to death. However, the night before her execution, a powerful lunar politician named Tweed offers her the chance to escape her sentence by replacing her with a clone killed in her place. Lilo accepts and Tweed takes her into hiding.

Tweed is the leader of a movement that intends to expel the Invaders and recover Earth, and makes Lilo join this movement under the watch of Vaffa, a guard who has multiple illegal clones, both male and female. Lilo attempts to escape twice, but each time she is killed by Vaffa, and a clone is revived with her original memories. 

The third clone of Lilo is sent to an outlying moon of Jupiter, 
Poseidon
, within which Tweed pursues clandestine research performed by illegal clones. Lilo bonds with Cathay, the teacher of the colony's children, and they become lovers. She is given a null-field suit — a conforming forcefield with an air generator that protects her from the vacuum — and is tasked with researching how to kill creatures that live in Jupiter's atmosphere. She reveals to Cathay that, when she began her original experiments, she put a clone of herself and a backup of her memories in a secret base in Saturn's rings, to ensure her survival in the event that she was executed.

Tweed then acquires a 
micro black hole
 with the intention of passing it through Jupiter in an attack on the Invaders. Lilo and Cathay board the ship transporting the black hole and seize it. After a struggle, Lilo and a Vaffa clone fall towards Jupiter. Vaffa dies, but Lilo encounters an Invader and is taken to a future version of Earth almost devoid of humanity.

Tweed then awakens another version of Lilo and sends her with a clone of Vaffa to Pluto to research a new message coming from the Ophiuchi Hotline. This one has been translated as a payment demand for the information that humanity has received, but does not specify what form the payment is to take. Lilo and Vaffa find a second clone of Cathay, and the three of them are tasked to lease a ship from navigators dedicated to hunt for black holes, and go beyond the orbit of Pluto to analyze the message. They eventually hire Javelin, one of the most successful black hole hunters.  

Once in space, Javelin reveals that the black hole hunters have discovered that the beam of the Hotline originates from a point only half a light-year away from the solar system, scrambled to seem to come from much farther, and she will take them to the source of the beam. However, since the trip will take 20 years Lilo, Vaffa and Cathay go in hibernation.

In the meantime, the first clone of Cathay uses the stolen ship to reach Lilo's base. There he meets Parameter/Solstice, a human-symbiont pair who also know the location of the base. They revive the clone and use the ship to attack Poseidon, taking it out of orbit and destroying its security systems. To do this they crash Lilo's base into a black hole held in a force field on the moon's surface.  They carry out a plan to transform the asteroid into a ship to travel to 
Alpha Centauri
, but reveal Tweed's dangerous activities to the Eight Worlds, forcing Tweed to go into hiding. 

When Javelin's ship and its passengers reaches the source of the Hotline, they are greeted by seemingly-human extraterrestrials who have been expecting them. They explain that most races in the universe have experienced a similar history with the Invaders: they are expelled from their home planets by the Invaders; they attempt to recover their planets by force, much as Tweed has been doing; and in the ensuing conflict they are driven out of their solar systems entirely. The extraterrestrials have been broadcasting information via the Ophiuchi Hotline to give humanity the tools they need for survival, and the price they ask in exchange is to be allowed to live alongside and within the minds of humans, so that they can add humanity's experience and thoughts to their own pool of knowledge. They suggest that, if humanity does not comply, they will turn the symbionts into an army that will attack humanity on the Eight Worlds. 

The clone of Lilo previously transported to Earth spends 25 years there. Because of her null-field suit which she can turn on at will, she is worshipped as a god by the surviving humans scratching out a living at a pre-industrial technological level. During a dive to hunt a whale, she encounters an Invader, somehow steals a silver cube from it and is instantaneously transported to the source of the Hotline. There she meets her clone, and they find that the memories and knowledge of all of their clones, including those killed by Tweed, are somehow mixed and shared between them.

Somewhat surprised by this turn of events, the extraterrestrials explain that the silver cube is a 
singularity
 that can be used for space propulsion by canceling inertia. They add that the Invaders only give such a ""gift"" to races when they're preparing to expel them entirely from their home planetary system. Confronted with this news, Javelin, Cathay, Vaffa and both clones of Lilo return to the solar systems to alert humanity.

As the novel concludes, the clone of Lilo traveling in the asteroid towards Alpha Centauri meditates on her shared memories, and realizes that when she arrives there her fellow clones, and most of humanity, will be already be there waiting for her, having used the singularity for faster travel."

Section 1 – Jenna:
 Jenna Hoolman and her brother, Del live in Sapphire, a former gas town in southeast England. The draining of the nearby 
Romney Marsh
 through 
fracking
 and the recent war has left the town destitute. Smartdog racing has become its only source of income. Smartdogs are 
greyhounds
 enhanced with human 
DNA
 to connect ""telepathically"" to human ""runners"" with 
neural implants
. Del is actively involved in racing and has his own smartdog, Limlasker, but Jenna is frightened of her brother's drug-running and violent outbursts. He has a daughter, Luz Maree (Lumey) who, at three, starts to show signs of being an empath. Empaths are able to communicate with smartdogs without an implant. Lumey is kidnapped, ostensibly to force Del to settle his drug debts. He enters Limlasker in a race the dog is not ready for, hoping for a win to secure his daughter's release, but the dog is assassinated.


Section 2 – Christy:
 Christy Peller lives in present-day 
Hastings
 in south England and is a writer. Some of her stories are set in the future in a fictional town called Sapphire where smartdog racing takes place. Christy lives in fear of her brother Derek, who once raped her. When Linda, his girlfriend, disappears after he discovered that she was planning to return to her previous boyfriend, Alex, Christy begins searching for her. She suspects that Derek may have murdered Linda.


Section 3 – Alex:
 Alex Adeyemi grew up in Hastings, and twenty years after the events in Section 2, Christy invites him to come and visit her in Hastings to help her locate his former girlfriend, Linda. Alex discovers that Christy is a writer and begins reading her stories. He is particularly interested in 
At the Cedars Hotel
, a collection of stories that includes ""Dogs"", and ""Brock Island"", a sequel to ""Dogs"".


Section 4 – Maree:
 Maree is a young woman who lives in a secret government facility in Crimond She has no memories of her childhood, except those of a smartdog, Limlasker. She later learns that Derek Hoolman was her father and that she was kidnapped because she is an empath. She is sent to Thalia across the Atlantic Ocean by ship to a research facility called Kontessa. During the journey Maree learns of the real reason she is needed in Kontessa is to assist in translating extraterrestrial messages a 
SETI
 programme has intercepted.

 After working at Kontessa for several years and not making much headway on the alien messages, Maree retires to Brock Island off the coast of Thalia. There she learns that an enigmatic artist Laura Christy has disappeared. Laura maintained that she has a twin sister, Sidonie who communicates with her in her dreams. While there is no record of the twin, Laura insisted that Sidonie is real and resides in a parallel world. Laura wrote that Sidonie told her they are reflections of one another, and that Sidonie and others in her world have been trying to communicate with their counterparts here for centuries. Maree finds some portraits Laura had painted of Sidonie, and in one of them, her twin is holding an 
abacus
. Maree copies the bead pattern on the abacus, and later compares it with the patterns she had been working on in the alien transmissions. The bead pattern on the abacus matches the patterns in the alien transmissions.

Sailing to the Future
[

The story begins with Elric lost somewhere in the Young Kingdoms and near the sea. A mysterious ship appears and he is welcomed aboard by its captain and introduced to three other powerful warriors. The captain informs the adventurers that they are traveling across time and between realities. They have been found because they alone have the power to stop alien sorcerers from destroying their worlds. They come to understand that they (Elric, 
Erekosë
, 
Dorian Hawkmoon
, and 
Corum Jhaelen Irsei
) are 
Eternal Champions
 and are actually four different iterations of the same being. The Champions are instructed that they must slay the evil beings and destroy their building by fire. Upon finding the dwelling place of the creatures, they face many dangers within. The Champion finds a sentient pool in a well that seems to be trying to communicate to its partner. The four Champions assimilate into one eight-armed being, and destroy the creature in the pool,  only to discover that the 'building' they have invaded is the body of the other creature. They destroy it and go their separate ways, with the memory of what happened fading like a dream.



Sailing to the Present
[
edit
]


Elric finds himself on another shore without the memory of his last adventure. He meets a sailor called Count Smiorgan Baldhead who accompanies Elric as they are followed by a mysterious, riderless horse. Elric and Smiorgan find that they are in another world, one inhabited by a Melnibonéan nobleman named Saxif D’an. Saxif recognizes Elric but does not honor his sovereignty in this realm. Saxif is the subject of an old Melnibonean tale. In the legend, Saxif loved a half-human woman but she loved another; Prince Carolak. In the legend, Saxif kills the woman rather than see her with another, only to learn with her dying breath that she still loved him. Saxif is now obsessed with a woman, Vassliss,  who resembles his dead love and Prince Carolak reveals himself on a horse and defeats Saxif.



Sailing to the Past
[
edit
]


Elric and Smiorgan, after passing through the Crimson Gate, are saved from drowning by Duke Avan and his men. Duke Avan is travelling to find R’lin K’Ren A’a, the ancestral city of the Melnibonéans, where he seeks two rare gems purported to be the eyes of a large jade statue of Arioch. Elric and Smiorgan decide to join him on the voyage.

Using a map that Duke Avan has procured, the group crosses the boiling sea and finds the island marked on the map where R’lin K’Ren A’a is located. They enter the mouth of a river to head inland on the island. Along the river they are attacked by reptilian savages with human features and stork-like legs who hurl sharp crystalline disks from clubs. Losing the battle and with defeat imminent, Elric summons aid from King Nnuuurrrr’c’c of the Insects. Nnuuurrrr’c’c hears his summons and sends a swarm of giant dragonflies who annihilate the reptilian savages.

Elric, Smiorgan, Duke Avan, and the surviving crewman eventually find the island within the island where R’lin K’Ren A’a lies according to the map. They disembark from the ship into the jungle and eventually find the city. At the city they also find the great jade statue of Arioch, but the eyes are missing. The group is suddenly attacked by the reptilian savages again and Elric summons aid from Arioch who refuses to help.

The group flees into an intact building in the ruins to escape their attackers. In the building they find a message that appears to have been recently scribed. They emerge from the other side of the building into the central square of the city where they see two glass dome structures. Then they run into the nearest structure to again escape the pursuing savages where the group then becomes separated from each other.

Lost in the maze of the crystal structure, Elric and the others are saved by a naked man named J’osui C’reln Reyr who is revealed to be a 10,000-year-old man known from legend as the Creature Doomed to Live. J’osui hides them from the savage reptiles, whom he calls the Olab, and reveals that the crystal structure they were in is one of the eyes of the jade statue of Arioch. Elric learns from J’osui why he is cursed to live and why Elric’s ancestors were forced to leave R’lin K’Ren A’a for Melniboné. He also learns how he can end the curse by summoning Arioch to possess the jade statue and cause it to leave the city.

They return to the jade statue and Elric begins the ritual to summon Arioch. During the ritual, Stormbringer compels Elric to slay Duke Avan and a remaining crewman so that Arioch will heed the summons. Arioch comes, possesses the statue, and it leaves the city with its eyes intact. Stormbringer then leaps from Elric’s hand and slays J’osui C’reln Reyr. Elric and Smiorgan depart the city and find another ship laden with treasure that J’osui had informed them of, then sail away from the island.

In the summer of 1978, Brian Chaney, a 
demographer
 and 
biblical scholar
, is approached by a woman named Kathryn van Hise. Initially assuming her to be a reporter interested in a controversial book he just published on the 
Dead Sea Scrolls
, she informs him that she works for the 
federal
 Bureau of Standards and that she is recruiting him for a physical survey of the future via a secretly constructed ""TDV"" or 
time displacement vehicle
.  When Chaney demurs, she informs him that his contract has been purchased from the 
think tank
 where he works, leaving him little choice.

The reluctant Chaney travels to a military installation south of 
Joliet, Illinois
. There he is teamed with two diversely talented military officers, 
United States Air Force
 Major William Moresby and 
United States Navy
 Lieutenant Commander Arthur Saltus. Chaney soon finds that he shares with Saltus an attraction to Kathryn, who is their civilian liaison, but unlike Saltus, Chaney lacks the assertiveness to pursue her aggressively. Instead he focuses his attention on the project, which is soon ordered by the President of the United States to embark on their first mission, a trip two years into the future to discover whether he wins the 
1980 presidential election
.

The three travel to the Thursday after the election on individual trips, with first Moresby and then Saltus going first according to military seniority. Chaney, as a civilian, is the last to leave, but arrives earlier than the others due to a temporal navigation instrument error. They discover that the president, whom Chaney despises as a weak man (in fact, his name is given as ""President Meeks""), wins the election in a landslide as a result of his successful handling of ongoing 
race riots
 in Chicago, and that these riots have resulted in the building of a wall down the middle of 
Cermak Road
 dividing the north of the city from the south. They also learn that the nation is under 
martial law
 after a failed attempt by the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff
 to take over the government by 
coup d'état
, one thwarted because of the advance knowledge the time travelers will bring back of it. While preparing for their return, Saltus informs Chaney of an additional discovery: a marriage license between him and Kathryn. Chaney concedes to the gloating Saltus.

With the success of the initial mission, the three are authorized to travel further into the future. They plan to travel to dates of their own choosing within the coming two decades, with each trip to be separated by approximately a year in order to provide broader coverage.

Moresby goes first and travels to July 4, 1999 (""It has significance, after all!"" he says), only to emerge in the middle of a racial civil war in which Chicago had recently been attacked with a 
nuclear bomb
 launched from China on behalf of 
black guerrillas
. Quickly getting involved in a battle between base troops and invading ""ramjets"", as the 
black guerrillas
 are called, Moresby dies in an attack on a ramjet 
mortar
 position.

Saltus is the next to go, traveling to the date of his 50th birthday in 2000. Upon arrival, he discovers remnants of the battle, and is nearly killed by survivors hiding out on the base. Wounded, he is assisted back to the displacement vehicle by an unknown figure and returns to the present, taking with him a tape-recorded report that Moresby had made upon his arrival.

Forewarned by Saltus's experience, Chaney travels further into the future. Not having chosen a date, and disillusioned by his experiences on the 1980 trip, he arrives at an indeterminate point in ""2000-plus"", by which time the power from the base's 
nuclear reactor
 has been disrupted, causing the chronometers set up for the travelers to shut down. Venturing outside, he finds the base to be long-neglected, apart from a 
cistern
 and a grave. While further investigating the grave (that of Saltus), he is approached by a young man and a woman who identify themselves as Arthur and Kathryn's children. They take Chaney to Kathryn, now elderly, who reveals that civilization collapsed as an indirect result of the time travel project; with the information from the future, the president made a series of disastrous decisions that led to war with China, followed by the civil war and societal destruction. When Chaney asks how much of this information he reports, she informs him that he reported none of it, that with the loss of power the time displacement vehicle can no longer return to the past and that Chaney is trapped in the future.

Although it is foreshadowed earlier in the book, only at this point is the reader explicitly told a fact that makes Chaney's predicament all the more tragic. He is black, the only such member of the project. ""Everyone fears you; no one will trust you since the rebellion,"" Kathryn tells him. ""I am the only one here who does not fear a black man."""

 It is, indeed, the wealthiest and most polluted city in Italy, and local magnates are concerned that the volcanic fires fueling their industries are dissipating or shifting. Vergil's charge is to use his skills and magic to investigate the problem and, if possible, solve it.

The book tells the story in flashbacks during the actual Mars mission of the chronicalised history until the mission's beginning. The 
point of divergence
 for this alternate timeline happens on 22 November 1963, where 
John F. Kennedy
 survived 
the assassination
 (
Jacqueline Kennedy
 was killed, hence the renaming of the 
Kennedy Space Center
 as the Jacqueline B. Kennedy Space Center), but was crippled and thus incapacitated, as 
Lyndon B. Johnson
 is still sworn in. On 20 July 1969, 
Apollo 11
 astronauts 
Neil Armstrong
 and Joe Muldoon walk on the Moon, and Nixon's ""most historic phone call"" is joined by a call from former President Kennedy, committing the United States to send a crewed mission to 
Mars
, which Nixon backs as part of his fateful decision to decide the future of crewed spaceflight, instead of deciding on the 
Space Shuttle
 program as he did in our timeline.

Preparations for this new goal include slashing the number of Moon landings so funding and leftover 
Apollo spacecraft
 hardware can go towards the efforts of the crewed Mars mission. 
Apollo 12
 still lands, 
Apollo 13
 still suffers its disaster, but 
Apollo 14
 is crewed by the astronauts of the cancelled 
Apollo 15
 mission to carry out the 
scientific experiments on the lunar surface
, and is the last crewed Moon landing. At the same time, the 
NERVA
 program is revived to become the chosen Mars spacecraft development, with larger tests in 
Nevada
, but without containment and plagued with engineering problems.

The book centres around chronicling the lives of the future Mars mission astronauts, NASA and contractor personnel all involved in making the mission become a reality, and the shifts within NASA's astronaut and management hierarchy throughout the mission's preparations, including female geologist Natalie York's quest to become an astronaut, and her stormy relationships with fellow astronaut Ben Priest and NERVA engineer Mike Conlig. Other astronauts include Ralph Gershon, a former fighter-bomber pilot involved in illegal bombing missions in Cambodia during the 
Vietnam War
 whose dream is to be the first black man in space, and Phil Stone, a veteran Air Force 
test pilot
-turned-astronaut who has flown in a long-term stay on a lunar orbital station before the Mars mission.

In the 1970s, the 
Skylab
 Space Station is launched, but apparently as a 
wet workshop
 design that is based on the 
Saturn IB
 
S-IVB
 upper stage called 
Skylab A
. The 
Saturn V
 that might have launched Skylab in our timeline instead launches 
Skylab B
, a lunar orbit space station unofficially named ""Moonlab"", also a wet workshop based on the S-IVB. The 
Apollo-Soyuz Test Project
 is instead a series of visits by the 
Apollo Command/Service Module
 to 
Salyut
 space stations, and 
Soyuz
 missions to both Skylab and Moonlab. To facilitate the latter, the Soviets finally finish work on their 
N-1
. The Skylab/Moonlab programs lead to improvements in the design of the Apollo Command/Service Module. A Block III CSM is produced using battery power in place of fuel cells, followed by the Block IV and V, which have a degree of reusability (modular construction and resistance to salt water 
corrosion
). Also chronicled is the development of the experimental '
Mars Excursion Module
' by small aerospace firm Columbia Aviation as it struggles against larger rival contractors of NASA and its engineers working painstakingly against the technical challenges of a working and reliable Mars lander.

A test of the NERVA, called 
Apollo-N
, is finally launched atop the modified Saturn VN, but suffers from 
pogo oscillations
 in the 
S-IC
 first stage. This damages the NERVA upper stage, which catastrophically fails once fired in orbit; despite returning to Earth safely, the entire crew (including Ben Priest) is killed by 
radiation poisoning
, and the space program nearly collapses from hostile political and public opinion against the use of nuclear power in space, and the seemingly unnecessary risks and reasons of a Mars mission.

In the aftermath, a new Mars mission plan dubbed 
Ares
 is drawn up, utilising the upgraded 
Saturn V-B
, which has numerous improvements, including the use of 
solid rocket boosters
 to double its payload. 
Ares
 also uses on-orbit assembly of a different long duration Mars-ship using wet-workshop 
Saturn rocket
 components as the propulsion systems as well as a Skylab habitat module and 
external tanks
 to hold extra fuel. 
Ares
 performs a 
Venus
 flyby reminiscent of the 
Manned Venus Flyby
 
NASA
 planned in the aftermath of the original Apollo program, but done in this timeline for 
gravitational assistance
, and finally lands at 
Mangala Valles
 on 27 March 1986.

However, as a side effect, a number of uncrewed probes – including the 
Viking program
, 
Pioneer Venus project
, 
Mariner 10
, 
Pioneers 10
 and 
11
, and the 
Voyager program
 – are cancelled so that their funding can be redirected to the crewed Mars mission, although another Mariner orbiter is sent to Mars to help prepare for the crewed landing. As a result, although humans walk on Mars, their knowledge of the 
Solar System
, including Mars itself and especially the outer Solar System planets which never get visited without the Pioneer/Voyager missions, is far less than in reality."

Central to the story is an 
artificial intelligence
 named H.A.R.L.I.E., also referred to by the proper name ""HARLIE""—an 
acronym
 for Human Analog Replication, Lethetic Intelligence Engine (originally Human Analog Robot Life Input Equivalents).

HARLIE's story revolves around his relationship with David Auberson, the psychologist who is responsible for guiding HARLIE from childhood into adulthood.  It is also the story of HARLIE's fight against being turned off, and the philosophical question of whether or not HARLIE is 
human
; for that matter, what it 
means
 to be human.

When HARLIE Was One
 contains one of the 
first fictional representations
 of a 
computer virus
 (preceded by 
Gregory Benford
 in 1970), and one of the first uses of the term ""virus"" to describe a program that infects another computer.

During World War II, Simon Tregarth rose from a common soldier in the 
U.S. Army
 to the rank of lieutenant colonel.  In post-war Berlin, he became involved, almost accidentally, in the 
black market
, only to be caught and discharged in disgrace from the Army. He later also managed to anger a powerful criminal organization enough for it to send assassins after him. After months on the run, killing at least two of these assassins, he knows his time is running out.

Then Tregarth is contacted by Dr. Jorge Petronius, a man with an amazing reputation for hiding men in dire straits. Petronius recounts a fantastic tale of a stone of power, the 
Siege Perilous
 of 
Arthurian legend
, that has the power to open a gateway to a world attuned to the person who sits on it. Disbelieving, but with little to lose, Tregarth gives him all the money he has left, and is transported to a land where magic vies with more mundane swords and bows.

He arrives in a nearly empty countryside, just in time to witness a savage hunt: a lone woman being chased down by hounds followed by two horsemen. Tregarth rescues the woman, who he much later learns is a witch named Jaelithe, and enters the service of her homeland Estcarp, a land ruled by witches and threatened by many enemies. One of these enemies is the land of Gorm, which was bloodily taken over by the far-off, mysterious realm of Kolder.

Estcarp's sole trusted ally is a nation of seafaring traders, the Sulcarmen. When Magnis Osberic, leader of the Sulcarmen, requests help at their citadel, Sulcarkeep, Tregarth and Jaelithe are among those sent to its aid. On the way, they are ambushed by, but defeat, men who appear to be mind-controlled by some unseen entity. Afterwards, Koris, a refugee from Gorm and now Estcarp's Captain, recognizes some of the bodies as men of Gorm. The group reaches the island fortress of Sulcarkeep, but most of the Sulcarmen are away in the season of trading, and an attack including troops coming from the air overwhelms the few defenders. While a handful of survivors flee in small boats, Osberic remains behind to blow up Sulcarkeep, taking many of the enemy with him.

The violence of the explosion causes the tiny vessels to founder; Tregarth and Jaelithe both reach land, but are separated. Jaelithe is captured by Fulk of Verlaine, a coastal lord, but then helped to escape by Loyse, his daughter. Together, the two women make their way to Kars, capital of Estcarp's restive southern neighbor Karsten. Tregarth, guided by a mental link with the witch, is reunited with her there.

Soon afterwards, Karsten erupts in a frenzy of killing targeting those of the Old Race, the principal ethnic group of Estcarp. Tregarth, Jaelithe, Koris and Loyse flee the carnage. Tregarth organizes a guerrilla force, drawing on his military experience, but is caught and shipped to Gorm to be turned into a mindless slave, like those encountered on the way to Sulcarkeep. Fortunately, he is able to escape.

The witches of Estcarp launch an attack on Gorm's capital city. When Tregarth fights and kills the enemy leader, during the intense struggle, he inadvertently achieves a mental rapport with his opponent and learns that the people of Kolder are like him in some respects; they are a small number of soldiers, refugees from another universe, though one with a higher level of technology than Earth. Estcarp is victorious, but the threat from Kolder remains.

The story is concluded in the sequel, 
Web of the Witch World
, which with 
Witch World
 makes one complete story."

Hollis Henry and Milgrim find themselves 
in London
 working for 
Hubertus Bigend
, unaware that their lives previously crossed in 
Spook Country
. One of Bigend's current interests is fashion, particularly the intersection between streetwear, workwear and 
military clothing
.  Milgrim is sent to South Carolina to take photographs of a pair of Army 
BDUs
 where he gains the notice of a federal agent named Winnie Tung Whittaker employed by 
DCIS
.  Winnie photographs Milgrim and intimidates him into working as an informant.

Bigend asks Henry and Milgrim to investigate a 
secret brand
, named 
Gabriel Hounds
 after the English legend. At the same time, he becomes aware that a coup is being plotted within his company, Blue Ant.  When Milgrim realizes his cell phone is being tracked by rogue elements in Blue Ant, he slides the phone into a 
pram
 belonging to the moll of a member of the Russian mob, which leads to one of the mercenaries involved in the coup, who followed the pram, being captured and beaten.  Revenge against Milgrim then becomes the top priority of the mercs.

A parallel subplot follows Hollis as she tracks down the Gabriel Hounds designer.  Joined by her boyfriend Garreth, the mysterious daredevil featured in 
Spook Country
 who had been severely injured in a 
BASE jump
, Hollis Henry offers to help Bigend gain the release of Bobby Chombo, who has been captured by the mercenaries to force Bigend to swap him for Milgrim, but as part of the deal, Bigend must allow the Hounds designer to remain anonymous.  Garreth, because of his knowledge of tradecraft, assists Hollis in this, and in doing so calls in favors from an old man, implied to be the same person Garreth worked with in 
Spook Country
 (who, via implication in both books, might be Cayce Pollard's father), to help ensure secrecy. Bobby Chombo is critical to Bigend's plan to gain the ability to foresee stock market prices by a number of minutes. Events reach a climax at night in

The premise of this novel is the banishment to the seemingly metal-poor planet Treason of a group of people who attempted to create rule by an intellectual elite. The novel centers on the descendants of these anti-democratic thinkers who remain imprisoned on the planet. Through the ages, these descendants have formed nations which warred and allied with one another to gain advantages over their rivals in the race to build a starship. Due to the metal-deficiency on Treason, nations are forced to obtain it through a system of barter using 
teleportation
 devices known as Ambassadors.

The protagonist of the book is Lanik Mueller, 
heir apparent
 to the Mueller family kingdom. The Muellers, through generations of 
eugenics
, have the ability to heal at an accelerated speed and regrow body parts naturally. The dark side to the Mueller nation is that, in order to obtain iron and other metals, they trade organs and body parts, which are harvested from radical regeneratives (""rads""). Radical regeneratives are people whose bodies can't distinguish between health and injury, and so grow extra appendages as well as organs of the opposite sex; although this is a normal phase for most Muellers at the age of 
puberty
, the bodies of radical regeneratives never outgrow it.

After it is discovered that Lanik is a radical regenerative, Lanik's father must essentially banish him from the kingdom, so as to avoid sending him to the ""pens"", a place where radical regeneratives are kept in order to harvest their body parts; exile also functions to get Lanik out of the eye of the Mueller public, as well as to prevent harm from coming to Lanik's supposed younger brother Dinte. The banishment comes in the form of sending Lanik as an emissary and spy to the Nkumai, a rival nation. Due to his radical regenerative body, Lanik has grown breasts, which makes him appear to be a woman. Using this subterfuge, he poses as an ambassador from the 
matriarchal
 nation of Bird in order to discover what the Nkumai are trading in exchange for their abundant metals, which have allowed them to dominate their region militarily.

This mission is only the beginning of the adventure for Lanik, who discovers the secrets of the most powerful nations and at the same time gains additional abilities to save his people and determine the fate of his planet."

Professor Arton Daghdev's biology research is considered heterodox by the Mandate, the 
fascist
 government of Earth. Daghdev's theories contradict the Mandate's assertion that humanity is the pinnacle of evolution, and he additionally consorts with more direct revolutionary thinkers. He is convicted and sent to a labor camp on the 
exoplanet
 Kiln. There, he learns that the government has found remnants of an intelligent alien civilization. Commandant Terolan asks Daghdev to study the ruins and identify the builders. Daghdev is placed under the supervision of Mandate scientist Doctor Primatt.

Life on Kiln is exceedingly complex and interconnected; alien microorganisms have the capacity to infect humans. All Kilnish life is able to hybridize and form “macro-species” which are composed of many different organisms. This level of 
symbiosis
 and 
parasitism
 contradicts the Mandate's human-centric theory of evolution. Primatt is forced to censor her reports to the commandant to conform to scientific orthodoxy.

Daghdev begins a sexual relationship with Primatt while simultaneously planning an uprising with fellow prisoners. On the night of the planned revolt, a worker betrays the conspirators, and the revolution is stomped out. As punishment, Daghdev and Primatt are demoted to Excursions, while the ringleaders are executed. Excursions is the most dangerous job, composed of teams of laborers who are forced to leave the Mandate compound to inspect newly identified ruins.

On an excursion, an elephantine Kilnish animal destroys the team's flier. The Excursionistas are forced to brave the distance back to camp by foot. On the march back to camp, they are infected with Kilnish microbiota. They find that, just as the organisms of Kiln can all reach symbiosis with each other, the Excursionistas can now connect with each other on a nonverbal and subconscious level.

When they return to camp, they use their newfound connection to stage a more successful revolt against the Mandate. The narrative reveals that the “builders” for which the Mandate is searching are not a single species. Instead, they are an 
emergent property
 of the entire Kilnish ecosystem, which can become sentient under the right conditions. The newly awakened sentience, powered partly by the computing power of the Excursionistas’ brains, uses the native life of Kiln to destroy the Mandate's compound. Daghdev and the other survivors plan to return to Earth and colonize it with Kilnish life."

 police detective Henry Palace is in a race with time. As the apocalypse approaches, individuals are abandoning their former professional and vocational responsibilities to pursue various personalized ""bucket lists"" of preferred activities, but despite his redundancy from the nationalized Concord Police Department, Palace still intends to fulfill his duty to Martha and Brett Cavatone. As the U.S. economy is dismantled, Concord is full of empty storefronts, while remaining police protect citizens from their feral apocalyptic fellow inhabitants.

Henry and Nico, his sister, travel to the former 
University of New Hampshire
 (which has now ""seceded"" from what used to be the United States), in search of Brett. One member of the UNH student ""free republic"" government, Julia Stone, is engaged in firearms transactions. Eventually, Palace finds Brett in a small community near

U.S. Coast Guard
, assisted by the U.S. Navy, are attempting to prevent refugees and illegal immigrants from the eastern hemisphere and the vicinity of the impact zone from entering into the contiguous United States, using deadly force, which disturbs Palace, who witnesses refugees at sea being killed by them. It also emerges that Martha was having an extramarital affair and that her estranged husband abandoned the relationship for that reason.

Brett Cavatone is shot and killed by a sniper, who shoots Palace as well, injuring him. Although Palace is injured, he is flown to Concord by an SH-60 helicopter, where Concord medical staff are still maintaining healthcare services. It turns out Jeremy, a coworker of Brett's, killed him because he wanted Martha for himself, even faking evidence of an affair. He later dies of an overdose. As for Martha, she and her father Rocky are enmeshed in a fraud promising miraculous escape from the impending cataclysm. It is presumed that they died in the riot that occurred in Concord after the water is shut off.  However, Nico Palace is also pursuing a nostrum of her own- the use of nuclear deterrence against 2011GV1, which sets up the core scenario for the final book in the trilogy,

Distress
 describes the political intrigue surrounding a mid-twenty-first century 
physics
 conference, at which is to be presented a unified 
Theory of Everything
.  In the background of the story is an epidemic mental illness, related in some way to the imminent discovery of the TOE.  The action takes place on an 
artificial island
 called ""Stateless"", which has earned the wrath of the world's large 
biotech
 companies for its pilfering of their 
intellectual property
.

The narrator is a journalist for a science channel called SeeNet named Andrew Worth who carries video recording software in an intestinal implant. He is offered a story on a new illness called Distress, but declines. He journeys to Stateless through a series of convoluted flights to cover a presentation by 27-year-old South African physicist Violet Mosala, supplanting the preproduction by a colleague, Sarah Knight. When he arrives, he is informed by an asex anthrocosmologist named Akili that Violet's life is in danger. Violet is finishing her Theory of Everything, which she intends to present on the conference's last day.

Through interfacing with a talkative local, Worth learns that Violet plans to emigrate to Stateless after the conference to use her celebrity status to provide an opportunity for South Africa and other nations to end their support for the United Nations boycott of Stateless. He also witnesses the islands' physical underpinnings: it is basically held up by the activity of millions of micro-organisms. After meeting with a faction of anthrocosmologists, he learns that they believe in the concept that the universe is created by one person's Theory of Everything. That person is called the Keystone.

Worth becomes deathly ill and believes he has been infected with cholera by a faction of anthrocosmologists who wanted him to transmit the disease to Violet Mosala.  He recovers and is kidnapped by this group, who are led by a rival physicist Worth saw with Violet at the conference.  Worth and Akili are held on a tanker where it is explained that these cultists believe Violet's TOE will destroy the world.  Worth signals for help by connecting his implant to a port on the ship.  He and Akili are rescued by citizens of Stateless.

Worth returns to the conference and learns that a biotech conglomerate sent a militia to Stateless, angry at the technology they have appropriated. He negotiates with the militia to let a suddenly ill Violet return to South Africa, where she dies. Before her illness, however, she tasked an AI to synthesize her final theory. The militia moves to take over the main city of Stateless, brutalizing the citizens as they evacuate to the outskirts. While seemingly helpless to do anything at first, they soon strike back at the invaders by having triggered microorganisms consume the cities structural underpinning, sinking it into the ocean. Worth is fired from SeeNet and Sarah Knight replaces him, covering the war. Worth discovers that Sarah was working with the cultists, and that AIs are exhibiting symptoms of the titular mental illness as well. Believing that the AI that wrote the paper became the Keystone and that Distress will continue until a human reads it, Worth downloads and reads the paper, and realizes that all minds, together, collaborate in being ""the"" Keystone, giving all of humanity an intuitive connection with the universe."

Most games are reruns, with team after team of players attempting to complete the pre-packaged adventure.  But someone always has to be first – and every player wants to be part of the initial team that beta tests a game. To have the author/programmer themself serve as the game master, to face surprises no one has seen, even the most jaded of elite players compete fiercely for such a spot.

Candidia Maria Smith-Foster, an eleven-year-old girl, is unaware that she is a 
Homo post hominem
, mankind's next evolutionary step. 
Hominem
s have higher IQs, they're stronger, faster, more resistant to illness and trauma, and have quicker reflexes. Their eyesight, hearing, and sense of smell are superior as well.

By the time the narrative opens, Candy has acquired a high school education, some college, and learned karate, having achieved her Fifth Degree Black Belt from her neighbor, 73-year-old Soo Kim McDivott, who she is led to believe is merely a retired schoolteacher. McDivott, whom she calls ""Teacher"", is actually the discoverer of the 
H. post hominem
 species, and has identified and continues to mentor and lead a group of them, the AAs. As part of her karate training, she has learned to release her 
hysterical strength
, which permits brief bursts of nearly superhuman activity.

With international relations rapidly deteriorating, Candy's father, publicly a small-town pathologist but secretly a government 
biowarfare
 expert, is called to Washington. Candy remains at home.

The following day a worldwide attack, featuring a bionuclear plague, wipes out virtually all of humanity (i.e., 
Homo sapiens
). With pet bird Terry, a 
Hyacinthine macaw
, her ""lifelong retarded, adopted twin brother,"" who tends to ""parrot"" Candy's words even before she speaks, she survives the attack in the shelter beneath their house. Emerging three months later, she learns of her genetic heritage and sets off to search for others of her kind.

First the hunt turns up ""Adam"", a cheeky, irrepressibly punning, multitalented 13-year-old boy, who immediately sets out to win Candy's heart; next, Rollo Jones, a middle-aged physician with a broad history of survival-in-the-wilds experience ranging from a stint in the Peace Corps to mountain climbing; and finally, Kim Melon, an early-20s mom whose background is in computer engineering with Lisa, her six-year-old daughter. Rollo reveals himself as a sociopath, whom Candy is forced to kill defending Terry and herself.  Adam, Kim, and Lisa join Candy's quest for the AA community.  As part of the search, Adam reveals that he is an ultralight aircraft pilot.  Later he teaches Candy to fly.

Thereafter, an ultralight engine failure separates Candy from the others.  After getting it running again, she spots a contrail, which leads her to Vandenberg Space Shuttle Launch Complex, where Teacher and the AAs are laboring to preflight a shuttle, renamed the 
Nathan Hale
.  They have identified those who wiped out mankind, the 
Bratstvo
, translated as the ""Brotherhood"", a cabal of 
H. sapiens
, working from inside the Russian military to destroy all 
H. post hominem
s.  As insurance, they have  placed a doomsday device in geosynchronous orbit, a 
Strontium
-90 bomb whose fallout will render Earth uninhabitable for 200 years.

At this point, however, the AAs' plans have come unstuck:  They have modified the 
Hale
 to reach geosynch orbit, though it is a one-way, suicide voyage for the crew; but the miniature robot handler they have built to penetrate the bomb-carrying rocket and disarm the doomsday device is not up to the task.  Candy realizes, with her small size and hysterical strength training, she is the only one who can get inside the warhead chamber and disarm the bomb.  Despite the fact that it is a suicide mission, she volunteers.

Meanwhile, as Adam, Kim, and Lisa search for Candy, Terry begins relaying her thoughts, though initially they do not realize that is what they're hearing.

Arriving in orbit, Kyril Svetlanov, thought to be a 
Bratstvo
 defector, kills Harris Gilbert, the mission commander.  Kyril turns out to have been a double agent, whose job ultimately was to sabotage the mission, but he does not know about Candy's karate skills.  She breaks his neck and assumes responsibility for completing the mission.

Navigating across to the bomb-carrying rocket in a spacesuit, she disables the warhead.  Then she resets the navigational computer to land on the dry lake at Edwards Air Force Base and tries to secure herself against a bulkhead in preparation for the stresses of reentry.

As the missile begins to power-up for reentry, Adam finally realizes Terry is in fact relaying Candy's thoughts; that somehow she is in fact in space, about to attempt reentry in a non-human-rated vehicle, and that she'll soon be landing at Edwards.  He, Kim, and Lisa arrive as the missile is touching down, just in time to extract her, resuscitate her, and treat her injuries.

The author has left a number of threads trailing at the conclusion, some of which are followed-up on 25 years later in a sequel entitled

Axxter discovers a location where the exterior of the building has been blown out by an explosion and the interior rooms are full of corpses. He attributes this to 
bogeymen
 called the Dead Centers that live in the sealed off center sections of Cylinder.

Axxter gets a job working for one of the warrior tribes that inhabit the exterior of the building, redesigning their graphical branding identity. But the big reveal is hacked, apparently by the company that previously designed the tribe's graphics, embarrassing the tribe and leading to Axxter fleeing for his life.

Aided by a gas angel (a humanoid with a large gas bag growing out of its back so it can float in the atmosphere around the building) Axxter ends up on the far side of Cylinder. Axxter hatches a plan to travel through the center of the building back home, and to report on his odyssey as a form of entertainment for residents of Cylinder.

Along the way Axxter meets and is aided by a hacker who can move between bodies stashed in different parts of the building, and a Dead Center who teaches Axxter about an alternate information source to Ask & Receive.

Axxter learns that the destruction of the site that he discovered at the start of the novel was not done by the Dead Centers, but instead by a collaboration between the two most powerful warrior tribes on the building, enabled by doctored information from Ask & Receive. Axxter broadcasts this information to the entire building, leading to the collapse of the dominant power structure of Cylinder.

The third part of the trilogy, 
Helliconia Winter
 is set during late autumn in the northern continent, Sibornal. The book's protagonist, Luterin Shokerandit, is the son of the Keeper of the Wheel of Kharnabar, located above the far north of Helliconia. The Wheel is an extraordinary revolving monastery/prison built into a ring-shaped tunnel with a single entrance and exit, powered entirely by the efforts of the prisoners pulling it along by means of chains set into the outer wall. Once a prisoner enters a cell of the Wheel, it is impossible for him to leave until its full ten-year rotation has passed.

Luterin joins the army, where he gains renown by killing the commandant of an enemy battalion, taking his widow Toress Lahl as a slave. Soon, however, the first cases of Fat Death begin to appear in the Sibornalese army. The Oligarch, autocratic ruler of Sibornal, orders other troops to destroy this army in an attempt to halt the spread of the epidemic. Luterin is warned by Captain Fashnalgid in time for the two of them to escape with Toress Lahl and a foreign trader who has arranged for a ship to flee the area. While the ship is at sea, the Fat Death spreads among those aboard; however, thanks to the skills of Toress Lahl, who was trained as a doctor, the major characters survive. It is during this voyage that a great deal of information is discovered about the deep past of the Helliconia-Batalix solar system, its capture by Freyr, and the intertwined fates of humans and phagors.

After the ship lands, the Oligarch's army continues to pursue the deserters. They go on the run again, hiring a dog-sledge with a semi-human driver and his phagor slave in order to cross the mountains. Fashnalgid mortally offends their driver by sleeping with his wife, and the driver retaliates by arranging for his phagor to push Fashnalgid off the sledge while they are travelling through a dangerous tunnel. Luterin tries to save Fashnalgid, but also falls from the sledge. He is forced to walk for miles through the polar cold until he eventually rejoins the sledge and is able to travel the rest of the way to his father's estate.

Once home, Luterin proclaims that he wishes to marry Toress Lahl rather than his arranged noble bride, and gives Toress the key to an ancient shrine. A few days later, he expresses hatred for the Oligarch who ordered his army to be destroyed. From his father's reactions, he realises that his father is in fact the Oligarch. Luterin kills his father and flees to the Wheel of Kharnabar; he enters the Wheel and therefore remains in solitary confinement for ten years. When he at last emerges, he finds that the assassination of the former Oligarch is now seen as a positive event.

A party is arranged to celebrate Luterin's freedom and also to observe the day of Myrkwyr, when Freyr is seen for the last time, marking the beginning of the centuries-long great winter. After the festivities, the Master of Kharnabar has Luterin seized, with the intent of throwing him back into the Wheel. For phagors, Myrkwyr indicates the return of conditions favourable to their kind, and a phagor tribe makes plans to regain their dominance over humans. The phagors attack the party; Luterin escapes in the confusion and is reunited with Toress Lahl. The book ends as they leave for the shrine, where she has been living in hiding with their now ten-year-old son."

. The facility's mirror array suddenly turns on itself, and though key members of the family and their guests escape, almost two hundred of the partygoers are incinerated as the compound is destroyed within minutes. Robert himself is left to die by his wife Jade Sun, whom he manages to kill before he perishes. Surviving the catastrophe, the Sun matriarch Cixi takes Jade and Robert's son Darius Mackenzie under her protection. Robert's son Bryce Mackenzie learns that Crucible's destruction was caused by a 
Trojan horse
 planted decades before, and connects it to the Cortas. Robson Corta, the orphaned son of Rachel Mackenzie and Rafa Corta who has been living as a veritable Mackenzie hostage, flees Bryce's revenge and joins his uncle, Wagner Corta, in hiding.

In the wake of Robert's death, Bryce seizes control of the Mackenzie helium-3 operations at João de Deus, formerly Corta property, and establishes Mackenzie Helium. His elder brother Duncan solidifies his hold on Mackenzie Metals and reopens the only remaining smelter on the Moon, the original Mackenzie facility at Hadley. Bryce's blades decimate one of Duncan's work crews, nearly killing Duncan's son Denny. Citing Corta honor, Wagner rescues Denny even though he murdered Wagner's brother Carlinhos. As payback, Denny agrees to protect Robson while Wagner is away. Bryce's knives come for Robson, and though Denny and his people intervene, Robson flees.

Her bodyguard Marina Calzaghe's ""Moonday""—when she must decide whether to return to Earth before the Moon's changes to her body are irreversible, or stay on the Moon permanently—is approaching. With the LDC board turning against him, Jonathan Kayode hires Ariel as his legal advisor, knowing that her current lack of family and business alliances makes her the only person he can trust. Without warning Ariel, Jonathan seizes control of the LDC and arrests its board members. Ariel meets with Lady Sun, Lousika Asamoah, and Duncan Mackenzie to confirm whether they will position their families with or against Jonathan. She seeks out banker Vidhya Rao, whom she believes can give her insight into the Vorontsovs, who have gone quiet. Ariel is shocked to learn that the Vorontsovs have begun a brutal coup of their own.

Wagner and his team of surface workers encounter an Asamoah farming facility seemingly crippled by malfunctioning Vorontsov moon-dozers, who are now heading in the direction of the Asamoah city of Twé. The inhabitants of the facility have been assassinated by robots who now pursue Wagner's rover; he loses two teammates, but the survivors rendezvous with a rescue team. With his father Lucas missing and presumed dead, Lucasinho Corta is living under the protection of the Asamoahs in Twé. An attack disables the city's fusion reactor and the dozers begin covering the domes of Twé with surface 
regolith
 to render its solar panels useless. Lucasinho flees the city with his nine-year-old cousin Luna, daughter of Rafa and Lousika, but their transport pod is stranded at a remote relay station due to a lack of power. Lucasinho finds a rover, and their journey toward João de Deus is fraught with danger. Running out of energy and air, Luna and an unconscious Lucasinho find refuge in the destroyed subterranean Corta mansion, Boa Vista.

Aided by the Vorontsovs, the Lunar Mandate Authority of Earth has seized control of the Moon. In Meridian, Jonathan is assassinated, and Marina returns to Earth. Ariel is summoned by the mastermind behind the brutal takeover: her brother Lucas. Duncan seeks Robson as leverage against Lucas, but Denny lets the boy flee with Wagner, and is exiled by Duncan. Lucas reclaims Boa Vista."

In the beginning of 
Ombria in Shadow
, Royce Greve, ruler of Ombria, has just died and his mistress Lydea is being thrown out of the castle by the ancient, evil, and powerful Domina Pearl who wishes to gain control over the court by acting as regent for Royce's young son Kyel. Lydea flees through the dangerous night-time streets and eventually, with some aid from a mysterious source, reaches the tavern of her father. Meanwhile, beneath Ombria, Faey, a 
sorceress
 who can wear any face she likes, and her assistant Mag, who helped Lydea survive her flight from the castle, work on magical potions and charms for the wealthy of the city, including Domina Pearl.

In the castle Ducon Greve, Royce's bastard nephew, tries to support Kyel against the machinations of Domina Pearl in an increasingly paranoid climate. Various nobles, unhappy with Domina's ruthless rule, attempt to convince him to work against her and set himself up as the new prince of Ombria. Unwilling to go down such a dangerous route and concerned that it could have dire consequences for Kyel, Ducon manages to foist them off, escaping through the vast network of secret passageways and rooms that permeate the castle.

Faey is hired by one of Ducon's enemies to kill him; she makes a magical piece of charcoal that is imbued with poison. Mag, who has been observing Ducon, does not want him to die and searches for a way to undo the spell. However, she becomes trapped in the castle, eventually freed by the historian Camas Erl on the promise that she will bring him to meet Faey, who has been alive for ages, and whose history is entwined with the city's.

Ducon uses the charcoal to sketch a man who looks just like him, who seems to come to life. Pursuing him, but delirious from the poison, he inadvertently falls into Faey's lair. Lydea, there to seek Faey's help, insists that Faey cure him. With Ducon and Faey's help, Lydea is able to return to the castle where she works as Kyel's tutor alongside Camas Erl, who is obsessed with discovering the secret to Ombria's shadowy underworld. After being introduced to Faey, Camas wanders the underworld, trying to find out about the Shadow City and how Ombria has been changed in the past by its manifestation.

Mag is given a pendant by Faey, which had been left with her as a baby on Faey's doorstep. Using the small piece of charcoal that she finds inside, Mag begins to draw random shapes. The drawings are able to destroy various parts of Domina's body. Domina, enraged by what she considers Faey's betrayal, captures Ducon and Lydea along with Mag, bringing them to the secret room where she keeps her regenerative bed, the reason that she has lived so long. Faey leaves the underworld, and the stirrings of the incredibly powerful sorceress are the trigger for the manifestation of the Shadow City. While Ducon fights Domina, Lydea escapes with Kyel by running through a rift into the Shadow City shown to her by the same mysterious man seen earlier by Ducon. Ducon kills Domina, and then meets the man who looks like him - His father. From Ombria's reflection, years ago he fell in love with Royce's sister, and tarried with her long enough to get her with child. The shadow transition eventually finishes, and Ombria has changed. No one has memories of the previous Ombria but for Faey and Mag. Ducon is now Prince and Lydea his love, Kyel is his heir and Mag is Kyel's tutor. All is happy."

Isabella Clara Eugenia
, in this history the Spanish-imposed Queen of England


Shakespeare, actor and renowned playwright, is contacted by 
Nicholas Skeres
 on behalf of members of an underground resistance movement who are plotting to overthrow the Spanish dominion of England and restore Elizabeth I to the throne. To do this, they employ Shakespeare himself, tasking him to write a play depicting the saga of 
Boudicca
, an ancient 
Iceni
 queen who rebelled against the 
Roman
 occupation of 
Great Britain
 in the 1st century A.D. The conspirators hope that the play will inspire its audience, Britons once again under the heel of a foreign enemy, to overthrow the Spanish.

The plan is complicated by the Spaniards who, also recognizing Shakespeare's talents, commission him to write a play depicting the life of King 
Philip II of Spain
 and the Spanish conquest of England. Now Shakespeare must write two plays—one glorifying the valor of England, the other glorifying its conquest and return to the Catholic Church—at the same time. There is also a subplot of the exploits of the skirt-chasing Spanish playwright and soldier 
Lope de Vega
, who is tasked by his superiors in the Spanish military hierarchy to keep an eye on Shakespeare and while he does so flirts from woman to woman. De Vega even acts in Shakespeare's 
King Philip
.

Despite danger at every turn from both the 
Spanish Inquisition
 and a home-grown English Inquisition, the secret play comes to fruition, and despite qualms from Shakespeare and his fellow players it is performed. As the conspirators had hoped, the audience is roused into an anti-Spanish fury and rampages through London, killing any Spanish official they see and freeing Elizabeth from the 
Tower of London
. Despite this victory and England's reclaimed freedom, there is considerable loss of life on both sides.

Shakespeare is rewarded by the reinstated Queen Elizabeth with a knighthood and an annulment of his unhappy marriage to 
Anne Hathaway
, which frees him to marry his longtime mistress. The queen also grants his daring request that his 
King Philip
 play, which he considers to contain some of his best work, be staged. At the end of the story, Shakespeare uses his new status to facilitate the release of his friend Lope de Vega from English captivity, provided that he immediately return to the Continent."

Earth sends out a spaceship to investigate starfaring in far distant space of which traces have been found. The ship 
Envoy
, bearing a crew of six men and four women, travels at a speed close to the speed of light. At the end of the journey the crew meets a Centaur-like species on a planet they call Tahir that has left spacefaring behind. Sentient life is also detected in connection with a nearby black hole, a reading confirmed by the Tahirans. Their interest aroused, the Earthlings can send a combined crew to investigate.

Communications with this ""Holont"" is established and much knowledge is acquired. Differences aboard the ship, however, lead to the death of three men (Brent, Russek, and Cleland), and female pilot Kilbirnie crashes into the black hole. The six Earthlings left drop the Tahirans off at their homeworld and head towards Earth.

In between the story jumps regularly back to the development of human society over the gaps of many thousand years and to that of the 
Kith
, the closed group doing the starfaring, who are often shunned by the rest of Earth. The Kith have their own settlements on different planets, where some retire from time to time.

Earth has changed over the long period taken up by the voyage of the 
Envoy
, and no one is much interested in spacefaring anymore. On Harbor, a colony of Earth, the 
Envoy
 crew finds remains of the Kith society, which still are connected to spacefaring. But the last ship to plot trade-routes in space, the 
Fleetwing
, disappears from tracking. The cause is a Zero-Zero-failure ripping off the rear part of the ship. The 
Envoy
 sets out on a rescue mission as soon as possible but twenty years of outside time have passed by the time they reach the 
Fleetwing
. They save the remaining crew, thus building a foundation of experienced spacefarers to start spacefaring anew with the knowledge acquired from the Holont."

The book is about a 
solar geoengineering
 project conceived by a Texas oil-industry billionaire named T.R. Schmidt.
[
1
]
 Schmidt builds a launcher on the Texas-Mexico border to fire 
sulfur
 into the air, a form of 
stratospheric aerosol injection
 intended to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight into space.
[
2
]
 This technique replicates the effects of volcanic eruptions that inject sulfates into the atmosphere and produce global cooling, such as the 1991 
Mount Pinatubo eruption
.
[

]
 Schmidt's plan has uneven effects, helping low-lying areas such as the 
Netherlands
, 
Venice
, and the 
Maldives
, but threatening the 
Punjab
 with drought.
[

]


The main characters are Frederika Mathilde Louisa Saskia, the 
Queen of the Netherlands
,  and granddaughter of 
Queen Beatrix
;
[
5
]
 Rufus Grant, a part-
Comanche
 exterminator of 
feral hogs
; and Deep ""Laks"" Singh, a 
Punjab-Canadian
 
Sikh
.
[
6
]
 Saskia and Grant become entangled in Schmidt's plan, while Singh travels to the 
Line of Actual Control
 on the China-India border, where Chinese and Indian volunteers fight each other using non-lethal martial arts. Singh becomes a world-famous hero after several dramatic and well-promoted victories, but is felled by Chinese 
directed-energy weapons
.
[
6
]


Meanwhile, the Chinese government observes Schmidt's 
geoengineering
 efforts, and engages in advanced 
psychological warfare
, 
cyberwarfare
, and deadly 
tsunami bombs
 to shift European governments towards a pro-geoengineering stance. This also results in Saskia 
abdicating
 her throne for her daughter, after which she joins the growing consortium of smaller pro-geoengineering nations as the ""Queen of the Netherworld.""

In the climax of the book, Singh is sent with a team of 
drones
 on a covert mission by India, whose monsoons were delayed by Schmidt's geoengineering campaign, to destroy the Texas launcher. He is thwarted by Rufus, who takes action largely to protect Saskia, who is hiding in the launcher's subterranean shaft.

The book's title refers to the idea that once a solar geoengineering scheme begins, abruptly stopping it would result in rapid warming, called a 
termination shock

The territory is the vicinity of 
Tombstone, Arizona
 in 1881, but also refers to the magicians' power struggle. Most of the characters are named for historical individuals from the era; the aim is a tale that parallels recorded events, but places those in a context where magic is real.

The principal male character, Jesse Fox, is a horse trainer in the manner of 
John Solomon Rarey
. He has professional qualifications, but no stomach to pursue them: he is drifting, uprooted by unease over the abilities that have led to his sister's demotion to madwoman status and his own share of such abilities. The principal female character is Mrs. Mildred Benjamin, widow of David Benjamin, supporting herself as a typesetter for one of the Tombstone newspapers but moonlighting as the freelance author of Wild West stories for a ladies' periodical. She has a slight supernatural talent of perception.

The plot has multiple black magicians as its villains, but avoids identifying just whose hat is blackest until the final showdown. A bungled stagecoach robbery that involved one of the four Earp brothers, Morgan, leads to much ado with misdirected posses and the deaths of all participants except for him. Along the way Jesse's Chinese buddy Chow Lung, another magician, but one who is comfortable in his powers, is also killed, to keep Jesse in Tombstone. Jesse helps fight a major fire in downtown Tombstone and has his injuries nursed by Mildred; Mildred's house burns and Jesse helps her defend the lot from the machinations of a mining outfit that lays claim to the whole neighborhood. Jesse escorts Mildred to a ball, where the pair witness the magical dimensions of an altercation between 
Wyatt Earp
 and 
Doc Holliday
. By the closing pages Jesse has come to accept and is learning to manage his magical abilities, applying them to block Earp's deadly excesses in his efforts to defend and enlarge the well-being of his clan."

The novel opens with an Okeke man, Sunuteel, who finds an ancient cave of computers. His portable finds an open file and he starts listening to an audio file called ""The Book of Phoenix,"" which is called a ""memory extract.""  He becomes immersed in the story.

Phoenix is an accelerated biological organism who was created by LifeGen Technologies and lives in Tower 7 in 
Manhattan
 with other SpeciMen. She is told that her lover, Saeed, has committed suicide. Phoenix and Mmuo, her friend and another SpeciMen who can walk through walls, attempted to escape and destroy the tower, after freeing Seven, a mysterious winged man who appears to be a powerful SpeciMen, locked in a dome, hanging like the Hanging Man in the 
Tarot
. However, Phoenix is unable to escape and the Big Eyes catch her.  She explodes into fire like a bomb, killing everyone near her and knocking Tower 7 down, freeing everyone inside who is still alive.

It seems she dies, but she regenerates a few days later and is given an alien seed by the Backbone to return to 
Ghana
. Phoenix is being chased by the Big Eyes and while on the run she develops wings and with the aid of Seven flies to 
Wulugu
, Ghana where she secretly plants the seed.  Seven flies with her and teaches her how to ""slip,"" which is using time travel.  She can use this ability to go back in time.

In Ghana, she is given the name Okore and she lives peaceful with the residents. A year later the Big Eye shows up in Wulugu under the disguise of investors and shoots Kofi, her lover. She then explodes into fire, putting Kofi out of his misery and killing all nearby Big Eyes.

A reawakened Phoenix gives herself to the Big Eyes and is taken back to a tower in America. She escapes and reunites with Mmuo and Saeed. Saeed did not die of suicide, and instead awoke in a place where other dead SpeciMens are sent.  But he was created to survive, and he did.  Together the three of them destroy Tower 1, freeing all the inmates.

Phoenix is deemed a terrorist, but she still manages to get inside of the 
Library of Congress
,
 to learn more about the corporation, herself, her history, her friends and her mother before she heads to Tower 4 along with Saeed and Mmuo.

They successfully free the inmates and find HeLa, who is a SpeciMen who has the DNA that will produce blood that will make the recipient of it immortal.  That's what LifeGen Technologies is really doing: selling her blood to billionaires so they will live forever. There are 7 so far. Phoenix is attacked by the Big Eye at Tower 4. HeLa asks Phoenix to kill her so that she can escape her fate, and not provide immortality to any others, denying them the power of immortality. Phoenix burns and kills her and several Big Eye members before she dies. Phoenix regenerates and ""slips"" to take a trip to visit her surrogate mother just before the woman dies of cancer. Returning from the trip, she finds out that Mmuo is dead and Saeed has been taken away by the Big Eyes.

In a might of anger and rage she over heats like the sun and explodes, causing an apocalypse to fall on Earth. Saeed survives, which is what he was engineered to do, and leaves the deadland of America and walks to the ruins of West Africa. Using Phoenix' feather and a machine, he extracts her memory which is sent to an unknown database center, before placing it on his skin to extract his memory.  This is how The Book of Phoenix is preserved and told.

The novel ends with Sunuteel misinterpreting the Book of Phoenix on purpose and rewriting a wrong version of the story full of his own ideas which are used as the basis for the justification of the enslavement and oppression of the Okeke people by the Nuru people.  Because this is what he was always taught and he could not believe otherwise.  Another reason he changes the story was because he truth terrifies him after seeing Phoenix.

The epilogue is spoken by a mysterious white man.  He says that the story will continue, which points to the next book in the series, 
Who Fears Death

The first chapter, originally a short story, uses the family of one carpet-maker to describe the generations-long tradition of hair carpet-making on an unnamed world and how it was based on religious devotion to a distant, and seemingly immortal, Emperor.  The next several chapters describe more of the carpet-making culture from the viewpoints of a carpet buyer, a teacher with religious doubts, another carpet maker, a traveling peddler and a tax collector.  Some of them are aware of rumours that the reign of the Emperor may be at an end after tens of thousands of years.  As the story expands beyond one planet, we learn that a rebellion has in fact overthrown the central government and killed the Emperor and is bringing the news to the galactic region which includes the carpet-makers---a region that seems to have been removed from all official records.  The rebel leader who killed the Emperor has a secret:  the rebels' success and the Emperor's death were planned by the Emperor himself, grown weary of his long life.  Meanwhile, a distant space station near a black hole continues to serve as a delivery point for all the hair carpets, which come from not only one world, but more than ten thousand.  In an isolated bubble of space, removed from all the other stars of the galaxy, a lone planet is, over millennia, being paved flat.  Only an ancient palace remains and, within it, a captive former king kept alive by artificial means is forced to watch the destruction of his world.  The rebel leaders are astonished to learn that all the hair carpets have been sent through a hidden portal to this world and now cover most of its surface.  Back at the Imperial Archives, the still-loyal Archivist finally tells the ancient story:  the conquered king had teased the Emperor's predecessor about being unable to grow hair on his head, so in vengeance the old Emperor had decided to cover his enemy's entire planet with the hair of his former subjects, a plan which the next Emperor had allowed to continue for 100,000 years."

Jack Havig was born in the American Midwest in 1933 with a genetic mutation that allows him to travel through time.  He learns that an apocalypse will occur sometime in the 21st century due to overpollution and 
nuclear warfare
.

Farther still in the future, a 
New Zealand

Micronesian
 culture known as ""the 
Maurai Federation
"" will eventually dominate the world and impose their vision of a less industrialized, more ecologically balanced world.  Jack reasons that there must be others born with the same innate ability to travel through time.  In his initial search for them, he visits Jerusalem at the time of the Crucifixion.

Jack is discovered by other time travelers who are agents of a time-traveling organization called the ""Eyrie,"" that is based in the far future and is led by a racist man born in 19th century United States.  Initially Jack joins the group, but eventually rebels against them when he discovers and experiences first hand the extent of the Eyrie's rampant brutality and inhumanity as they attempt to achieve their goal of stopping the Maurai ascendancy. To defeat the Eyrie, Jack returns to the 20th century and devises a plan of his own to recruit time travelers and create a ""tribe"" that will return to the future to destroy the Eyrie.

Much of the story takes place in various times of the past, present, and future, including an extended interlude where Jack is sent on a mission by the Eyrie to medieval 
Constantinople
; where he saves the life of a Greek girl during the carnage of the 
Fourth Crusade
 and eventually marries her.

The future depicted in the book is the same as in Anderson's

Veniss Underground
 alludes in several places to the myth of 
Orpheus
 and 
Eurydice
. Like Orpheus, Shadrach descends into the underworld to retrieve his love, Nicola, but here from a 
cyborg
 
hell
, where genetic engineering and DNA splicing create fantastic and horrific creatures. Parallels also exist with Dante's 
Inferno
. Throughout the novel the idea of heaven and hell come into play. Nick looks into the chaotic world in which he tries to find purpose through what is called living art. Nick journeys into the underworld and makes a deal with the ""devil"", also known as Quin. 

As the story progresses, the reader takes on the second person perspective of Nicola and is introduced to a meerkat whom Nicola names Salvador. Salvador (an assassin meerkat sent by Quin) attacks Nicola but she incapacitates him. Nick arrives at Nicola's door and chokes her till she is near death and sent to an organ bank in the underworld. Shadrach comes into play in the third person point of view and takes the initiative of finding his lost love Nicola in the underworld. He finds Salvador injured at Nicola's apartment and cuts off the meerkat's head and attaches it to a plate and renames him John the Baptist. 

After, with the help of Dr. Fergusen, he finds a partially mutilated Nicola in an organ bank under a pile of miscellaneous body parts guarded by a naked troll. He carries Nicola through the tunnels back to his childhood home and finds a creation of Quin named Candle. Candle leads Nick to the Psyche witch named Rafter. After Rafter decides to try to salvage Nicola, Shadrach takes the action of venturing deeper into the underworld to kill Quin. He finds Nick, now transformed into a piece of living art, being attacked by some in the garbage re-cycling facility. Nick takes Shadrach lower and tells him how to get to Quin by jumping off a moving train with a parachute. Nick pushes Shadrach out of the train only to be shot by Shadrach as he falls. 

Shadrach manages to open his chute yet he hits the ground hard. Later, he wakes by a beach and an ocean and kicks over a skull where he finds another creation of Quin's called the Gollux. The Gollux tells him the truth while John the Baptist lies, the Gollux leads Shadrach to a ray-like creature named the saylber which Shadrach rides across the ocean and into Quin's world which is actually a very large minnow named the leviathan. 

He kills Quin and the remote and the whole place explodes. Shadrach climbs up the cliffs back to the subway level. Shadrach retrieves Nicola and takes her to the surface where they are both on a bridge staring at the city which is called Veniss.

 after Caitlin's father, Malcolm, received a job at the 
Perimeter Institute
. Caitlin is emailed by Dr. Masayuki Kuroda, a scientist specializing in ""signal processing related to 
V1
."" He believes that her blindness is caused by her retinas miscoding the visual information and offers to install a signal processor behind her left eye to unscramble the data. The device sends the data to a miniature computer, or ""eyePod"", which reprocesses the signals and returns them. The correct data is sent to her optic nerve, theoretically granting her sight. In duplex mode it sends and receives the signals, and in simplex mode it only sends them. Caitlin and her mother, Barbara, fly to Tokyo for the procedure. Although her pupils now react to light, Caitlin still cannot see. They return to Canada while Dr. Kuroda works on updating the software.

A bird-flu epidemic with a mortality rate of at least 90% has begun in China. Dr. Quan Li, a senior member of the 
Communist Party
, recommends the President order a culling of ten to eleven thousand people in the infected area with an airborne chemical. The President agrees and launches the Changcheng Strategy, cutting off all telephone, satellite, and wireless communication with the rest of the world, so that word of the culling does not spread beyond China's borders. Wong Wai-Jeng, a freedom blogger who is known online as 
Sinanthropus
, attempts to circumvent 
Internet censorship in China
 along with many other hackers. Collectively they learn about the bird flu outbreak. Many days after enacting the Changcheng Strategy, Zhang Bo, the Minister of Communications, convinces the President to restore communications. The moment they are back up, Sinanthropus posts a blog, informing the world of the bird flu outbreak and the culling. He is tracked down by the police and, while attempting to flee, breaks his leg and is captured.

The first software update Kuroda attempts is a partial success. Although Caitlin can still not see the outside world, it enables her to visualize the 
World Wide Web
 while the update downloads when the eyePod is in duplex mode. Dr. Kuroda speculates that the data being transmitted between the eyePod and his server in Tokyo is being interpreted by her optic nerve, allowing her to see this. He decides to travel to Waterloo to work with Caitlin on the implant more directly. In the interim, he suggests sending the retinal feed from her eyePod to his Tokyo server through Jagster, a fictional search engine,
[

]
 so that he can monitor how she reacts to different inputs. He dubs her ability to visualize the internet ""websight"". Caitlin notes that, along with websites and links, she can visualize a background in websight that looks like a chess board. Dr. Kuroda speculates that the background is made up of 
cellular automata
, which Caitlin suggests is caused by corrupted 
packet loss
. Several 
Zipf plots
 are run of the cellular automata, which has a negative one slope. The Decters, Dr. Kuroda, and Anna Bloom, a network cartographer, realize that means the cellular automata contain intelligent content, which Anna suggests is secret communications from the 
National Security Agency
. They decide to keep investigating the cellular automata discreetly.

In San Diego, California, Shoshana Glick, an ape-language researcher and graduate student, works at the Marcuse Institute, a primate research centre. Hobo, a 
chimpanzee
-
bonobo
 
hybrid
, communicates by sign language. Doctor Harl Marcuse, the owner of the Institute, sets up a connection with the Miami Zoo. Hobo communicates with an 
orangutan
 named Virgil in the first interspecies 
webcam call
. The Marcuse Institute and Miami Zoo agree to announce the chat jointly, but the Miami Zoo leaks word of it to 
New Scientist
, who go to the Georgia Zoo – Hobo's birthplace – for information on him. Georgia Zoo, fearing about the contamination between the captive chimpanzee and bonobo bloodlines, demand Hobo be returned to them so that he can be sterilized. Hobo paints a portrait of Shoshana, surprising everyone at the Institute as it had been believed that chimpanzees could only paint abstractly. Dr. Marcuse theorizes that the communication with Virgil had shown Hobo ""how three-dimensional objects could be reduced to two dimensions."" The Marcuse Institute decide to record Hobo painting a second time and then go public, believing that the outcry over sterilizing him would force the Georgia Zoo to back down from their plans. The Georgia Zoo issues a lawsuit, planning to castrate Hobo.

Dr. Kuroda sets up a final software patch. While at school, Caitlin decides to take a break from her work and switches the eyePod to duplex mode so she can look through websight. It fails to load and, disappointed, she returns the eyePod to simplex mode. She sees several lines crossing her field of vision and is surprised when she realizes that they are the edge of a lab bench and that she can now see. Barbara picks Caitlin up from school and informs her about the patch. Malcolm runs 
Shannon entropy
 graphs on the cellular automata to gauge how complex the information in them is. He shows Caitlin how to run it, and they discover that the information has little complexity. Dr. Kuroda holds a press conference, announcing the success of his invention that has made Caitlin able to see. Caitlin receives an electric shock which crashes the eyePod. She reboots it in duplex mode and sees a mirrored representation of her face in websight.

An intelligence has spontaneously emerged on the Web. Cleaved in two when the Changcheng Strategy was enacted, the restoration of communications by China causes the two halves to coalesce, and it gains in intelligence. The intelligence can view Caitlin's eyePod feed. It believes that her vision is an attempt to communicate with it and, when her eyePod was rebooted, it sent an image of Caitlin in an attempt to communicate back. As Caitlin begins to learn how to read letters, the intelligence believes it is a further attempt to communicate and learns with her. When she switches to duplex mode, it takes that act to be a reward for its learning progress. Caitlin believes it to be ""visual noise"" as a result of gaining sight. Dr. Kuroda looks at the information on his server, and Caitlin realizes that the information is her reading exercises being bounced back to her. She then runs another Shannon entropy scan, realising that the information in the cellular automata has increased in intelligence. Caitlin deduces that the information is trying to communicate with her and decides to help it. Dr. Kuroda feels it is now time to return to Japan and informs her that, as she can now see, he will remove the duplex setting from her eyePod. Caitlin convinces him to keep it as is so that she can continue to see websight. She runs another Shannon entropy plot and realizes that the intelligence has increased yet again. She continues with her teaching efforts, leading the intelligence to different websites so that it can continue learning. She runs the Shannon entropy a fourth and fifth time and finds that the intelligence is double that of human complexity.

The intelligence contacts Caitlin via email and wishes her a happy birthday. It thanks her for helping it to learn and invites her to communicate with it through instant messenger. She asks it what she should call it, and the intelligence replies ""Webmind"". Webmind and Caitlin decide to go forwards together.

Told in alternating, non-chronological chapters, the novel is separated into three parts: ""Winter Kitchen"", ""Summer Kitchen"", and ""Oz Circle"". The story follows three characters, each connected to the story of 
The Wizard of Oz,
 and how they are all connected to one another without even realizing it.

The primary focus is on Jonathan, a gay actor with 
AIDS
 who goes on a obsessed pilgrimage of sorts to 
Manhattan, Kansas
, in search of the ""real"" Dorothy. 

Other portions of the novel explore the tragic life of ""Dorothy Gael"" in 1800s Kansas, whose traumatic experiences with Aunt Emily and Uncle Henry after her mother's death leads her to create an imaginary and idealized world in her mind based on some of her real-life experiences as a way of coping with her bleak reality. Unlike Baum's fairy tale book, she never gets to experience the magic of Oz, thus turning her into an insane and bitter old woman. 
L. Frank Baum
 himself makes an appearance as a substitute teacher in Kansas who meets Dorothy, and is so inspired and touched by their encounter, he decides to make her the main character of his classic fantasy novel. 

Finally, the book explores the life of 
Judy Garland

The novel follows the protagonist, Onyesonwu (
Igbo
 for ""who fears death""), who is an 
Ewu
, i.e. the child of an Okeke woman raped by a Nuru man. On reaching 
maturity
, she goes on a quest to defeat her sorcerous father Daib using her 
magical powers
. The novel is narrated by Onyesonwu to a journalist who interviews her before her execution. It is divided into three parts.



Part I
[
edit
]


The novel opens with the death of Onyesonwu's Father, which occurs when Onyesonwu was sixteen. The plot shifts back to her arrival in Jwahir. Onyesonwu  is a product of rape, her mother Najeeba's was raped alongside other Okeke women by a Nuru man when her village was attacked and destroyed by the Nurus.

Onyesonwu grows up in Jwahir after spending six years in the desert alone with her mother. She does not fit with the town people and is often ostracized because she is an Ewu. Onye meets a blacksmith named Fadil Ogundimu who treats her well, and eventually marries her mother.  Onyesonwu undergoes female circumcision at eleven in an attempt to become normal and accepted by the community against her parents wishes, giving her biological father the chance to haunt her. She bonds closely with the three other girls who undergo the rites, Binta, Diti, and Luyu. Soon after the rite, an Ewu boy named Mwita arrives at school. Mwita and Onyesonwu befriends each other because of their shared status and shared powers, but Onyesonwu is skeptical about him because Mwita is trained by Aro, the local sorcerer, who refuses to coach her because she is a girl. After Onyesonwu father's burial Aro decides to coach her.



Part II
[
edit
]


Onyesonwu's return to school days later after her father's death. She goes through a terrifying initiation which is literally her own death. She bonds with Mwita and develops her powers of shape shifting, resurrecting creatures, traveling to the ‘wilderness’ (spirit world) and she regrows her clitoris.

Onyesonwu's apprenticeship ends when she is mocked at the market and uses her abilities to make the mockers relive her mother's rape. After this, she leaves Jwahir and moves to help the Okeke in the west of the desert. Mwita, Binta, Diti, Luyu, and Diti's fiancé Fanasi decide to travel with her. On the way, Onyesonwu asks for direction to find the Nuru man prophesied by a Seer to rewrite the Great Book and she discovers that it was she who has been prophesied to rewrite the Great Book which justifies the oppression of the Okeke people and stop the Nuru attack in the west. The Seer was afraid to admit that an Ewu woman will change everything so he switched the race and gender.



Part III
[
edit
]


Tension grows among the group due to the harshness of the desert and Luyu and Fanasi begin to have an affair after Onyesonwu regrows her friends clitoris despite Fanasi's betrothal to Diti. They reach a supply town where Onyesonwu and Mwita are stoned because of their Ewu status and Binta is killed in the process. Onyesonwu, out of rage, blinds everyone in the town. After Binta's death, they encounter the Vah, a tribe who travels in the sandstorm. The Vah invites the group to stay with them for the three weeks they plan on remaining there. Onyesonwu discusses with the goddess Ani and she meets a Kponyungo (dragon like creature) who takes her to the east. Onyesonwu's spirit travels to the west and attacks Diab but Diab uses an evil juju to poison her.

Diti and Fanasi return to Jwahir after the Vah sorcerers heal Onyesonwu and the others continue on their journey. Onyesonwu, Luyu and Mwita reach ruined Okeke villages and people and Onyesonwu heals the sick among them. They reach Durfa, where Onyesonwu attacks Diab and Mwita is killed by him. Onyesonwu uses her ability to move one of her eggs towards Mwita's sperm causing an explosion which injures Diab and eventually leads to his death.

Luyu and Onyesonwu discover that the blast killed all fertile men around the region and impregnated all the fertile women. They both flee to an island where Onyesonwu finds the Great Book. She rewrites it with a magical script called 
Nsibidi
. The remaining Nuru men reach the island, kill Luyu and take Onyesonwu prisoner.

The epilogue, narrated by a Nuru who interviewed Onyesonwu, asserts that she was stoned to death and explains how he worked with his sister to dig her body. While a narration of the last two chapters by Sola describes Onyesonwu escaping execution by transforming into a Kponyungo and flying east to meet Mwita."

A Night in the Lonesome October
 is narrated from the 
point-of-view
 of Snuff, a dog who is 
Jack the Ripper
's companion. The bulk of the story takes place in 
London
 and its environments, though at one point the story detours through the dream-world described by Lovecraft in 
The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath
. Though never explicitly stated, various contextual clues within the story (the most obvious of which is the appearance of 
Sherlock Holmes
 or ""The Great Detective"") imply that it takes place during the late Victorian period.

The story reveals that once every few decades when the moon is full on the night of Halloween (a very rare ""Blue Moon"", meaning the second full moon in that month), the fabric of reality thins, and doors may be opened between this world and the realm of the 
Great Old Ones
. When these conditions are right, men and women with occult knowledge may gather at a specific ritual site to hold the doors closed, or to help fling them open. Should the Closers win, then the world will remain as it is until the next turning, but should the Openers succeed, then the Great Old Ones will come to Earth, to remake the world in their own image, enslaving or slaughtering the human race in the process. The Openers have never yet won. These meetings are often referred to as ""The Game"" or ""The Great Game"" by the participants, who try to keep the goings-on secret from the mundane population.

The various ""Players"" during the Game depicted in the book are archetypal characters from the Victorian Era 
gothic fiction
 – Jack the Ripper (only ever referred to as ""Jack""), 
Dracula
 (""The Count""), and the Wolf Man (known as ""
Larry Talbot
"", the film character's name) all make appearances. In addition, there is a 
Witch
 (""Crazy Jill""), a 
Clergyman
 (Vicar Roberts), a 
Druid
 (""Owen""), 
Victor Frankenstein
 (""The Good Doctor""), 
Sherlock Holmes
 (""The Great Detective""), a ""Mad Monk"" (""Rastov"" – apparently modeled after 
Rasputin
), and grave robbers or 
Hermetic
 occultists (""Morris and McCab"" – based either on real-life 
grave robbers Burke and Hare
[

]
 or a reference to a real hermetic of the time, 
MacGregor Mathers
).

]


Each Player has a 
familiar
 – an animal companion with near-human intelligence that helps complete the numerous preparations for the ritual. The majority of the story describes the interactions and discussions of these familiars, all from Snuff's point of view.

Throughout the book, the Players slowly take sides, form alliances, make deals, oppose one another, and even kill off their enemies. The plot accelerates until the night of October 31, when the rite takes place and the fate of the world is decided.

The novel's protagonist, Aiah, is a minor functionary for the Plasm Authority in the metropolis of Jaspeer; the Authority is the public utility company that taps plasm wells and sells the plasm (at very high rates) to those who would use it. Aiah is one of the Barkazi, an ethnic group whose metropolis, Barkazil, was engulfed by civil war several generations ago, its territory partitioned and occupied by the adjacent metropolises and its population dispersed as refugees. Barkazi religion centers around a 
trickster
 god, Karlo, who is constantly running 
scams
 on others, and the tradition of the scam, or 
chonah,
 is central to their culture. Aiah briefly studied plasm use at university, but ended her studies because of the high cost of the plasm required to continue them.

Working for an emergency response team investigating a huge flaming apparition of a woman that damages several city blocks, she discovers a previously unknown plasm well of tremendous power (the apparition being caused by a woman who blundered into the well and tapped the plasm directly, killing herself in the process). Instead of disclosing its location, she leads the Authority on a wild goose chase while trying to decide on how best to use it to her advantage.

She decides to reveal it to Constantine, a resident of a luxury apartment complex near her own. Constantine is a skilled mage and visionary political theorist with dreams of moving the world beyond its stagnant situation. He became Metropolitan of his home metropolis and attempted to implement many reforms, but was betrayed, forced from power, and exiled by those closest to him. Aiah, an admirer of his political thought, discloses the plasm source to him so that he might make another attempt at realizing his plans for the ""New City"", asking only that she be made a part of whatever he carries out.

Aiah then effectively runs a 
chonah
 of enormous scale, misleading the Authority, dealing with her Barkazi extended family (who want a piece of whatever action she is in on) and the local organized crime group, keeping her Jaspeeri boyfriend (working in a distant metropolis) in the dark, and avoiding the potentially lethal attentions of Constantine's right-hand-woman, Sorya. Through all of this she has a love affair with Constantine and receives training in magery from him, for which she has a great deal of natural talent.

At the novel's climax, Aiah's plasm source, and her own magical assistance, is a crucial element when Constantine orchestrates a revolution in the metropolis of Caraqui and installs himself in its post-revolutionary power structure, from which position he hopes to enact his New City reforms. Realizing that she has no hope of using her full potential as a bureaucrat in Jaspeer, Aiah leaves her job, family, and relationship behind and travels to Caraqui to help Constantine achieve his dream."

 called ""moonseed"" that starts to change all inorganic matter on 
Earth
 into more moonseed. It also gets transferred by a NASA probe to 
Venus
, and the explosion of Venus is the first clue as to what has been happening.

Stephen Baxter combines a host of disciplines (
space travel
, geology and 
disaster theory
) to tell a tale where the rocks are literally swept from under the feet of humanity. During the course of the novel, in which 
Edinburgh
 is the focus for much of the action, 
Venus
 is destroyed by an unknown cosmic event that showers the Earth with radiation that somehow stirs the moonseed on Earth. When Moon-dust containing the moonseed is dropped onto the streets of 
Edinburgh
 by a lab assistant of the main character, Earth's fate is sealed.  The moonseed begins to disintegrate the planet from the inside-out as the core heats up exponentially, while on the surface, 
nuclear power stations
 catastrophically fail, earthquakes and 
volcanic eruptions
 are abundant, and billions of people die as cities and continents vanish.

Over the course of the cataclysmic erosion of Earth, a collective of scientists and engineers in space agencies from around the world desperately try to 
terraform the Moon
 for colonisation, to provide a safe haven for some surviving humans before Earth eventually disintegrates into 
nothingness
 along with human civilisation.

This novel also presents numerous theories and ideas about the space-faring future of humanity, albeit in an alternate dimension where we are forced into space by an eroding Earth. It is also, in many stages, critical of

 stars. The discovery causes a sensation, since the ship is the first to approach the planet Erythrion in ten years. Eventually her claim is upheld, since the cycler is silent, and her mineral rights become salvage rights, making her potentially very wealthy. A rich cousin of hers, Max Cassels, sponsors an expedition to the ship so she can claim it. Intrigue happens on the trip as several factions also want to claim it, such as the planetary government. The cyclers were the centerpiece of the Cycler Compact, but have slowly fallen out of use since the discovery of 
FTL
 travel, only possible between ""lit"" worlds. When they reach the ship, they are surprised to discover that it is an alien cycler, an unknown because all known aliens use FTL ships. They explore the ship some and jump off as it passes a lit world, Chandaka.

Michael Bequith, a NeoShinto monk and aide to Dr. Laurent Herat, an 
exobiologist
, are commandeered by Rear Admiral Crisler of the Rights Economy to join a joint expedition back to the 
Envy
. The RE is interested, because the 
Envy
 appears to be a multi-species vessel, something previously unheard of. They are also interested because writing on the craft is the script of an alien species, the Lasa, who have supposedly been extinct for the last two billion years. Rue and her crew are also returning, since under Compact law she can only complete her claim if she can control the 
Envy
.

Before they can leave, the city suffers a rebel attack and one of their party, Dr Linda Ophir, is murdered. They travel in a 
ramscoop
 ship, the 
Banshee
.

When they arrive, they explore various areas of the ship before an explosion damages life support on the 
Banshee
. Michael discovers that Dr. Ophir was murdered because she had discovered pictures of the writing on the 
Envy
 had been tampered with. Eventually they discover that part of the 
Envy
 is designed as a test to ascertain living conditions for visitors. Rue completes the process and the cycler builds them a new module and a set of controls.

The expedition leaves the 
Envy
 for Oculus, a Halo world. Rue, now a Cycler Captain by law, is caught up in Compact politics over the course of the 
Envy
. Michael and Dr. Herat arrange with representative of the alien Autotrophs to translate the writing on the 
Envy
. The translation has grave consequences since it implies that the weapon of the Chicxulub, an ancient race that sent out waves of 
self-replicating machines
 to wipe out potential competitors, has survived. They realize that Crisler wants to use the weapon to wipe out the rebels.

Rue learns from Max that Mallory, a Halo Worlder, wants to dissolve the Compact and join the RE. Rue goes to meet her crew to prepare to leave, but they are ambushed by Crisler and Max is killed. Rue, Michael, Dr Herat and Barents (a Rebel) escape in a submarine, but the attackers destroy the control computer just as they dive. They continue to do so for some hours, eventually getting caught by a 
cold current
. They wind up at a secret undersea research base, where they are rescued by 
military police
.

They learn that Rue was believed dead along with her cousin and Crisler and Mallory have already departed for the 
Envy
, having learned its point of origin, Apophis and Osiris, planetless binary brown dwarfs. They expect that he will arrive in sixteen months. The government has a secret way that will get them there, but only for citizens of the Compact.

Dr. Herat elects to become a citizen of the compact, but Michael abstains. Michael passes preparation time for the trip by exploring abandoned ice tunnels on the planet with Barents. They discover that the Autotroph plans to leave the planet and warn its race about the weapon. Michael convinces them to let humans handle it. A message from a loyal member of the 
Envy
'
s crew arrives, stating that Crisler is planning a dangerous maneuver that will cut three months off his travel time. Rue takes drastic measures and 
shanghais
 Michael on the voyage, a new technology that allows a fleet of 15 small 
interceptor
 ships to enter FTL from inside the atmosphere of a brown dwarf.

They arrive safely at the Twins (except for one ship) and discover that the Twins are ringed with power tethers that allow resources and power to be extracted. In the 
orbital center
 of the system is the 
construction shack
 that created the 
Envy
. Her fleet is briefly attacked by the system's defenses, but she learns how to camouflage her ships. The 
Banshee
 was less successful and suffered a major 
hull breach
.

Rue and the soldiers sneak into the 
Banshee
 and free some of her original crew. The rest are in the construction shack, being used as explorers by Crisler. They leave for the construction shack, stealing an antimatter generator to use as cover. They enter the shack by way of burning a hole in the hull. Inside, Michael's team and Crisler's men are engaged in a 
firefight
 (literally, as the inside atmosphere is a hydrogen/oxygen mix). Michael shoots out a magnet block controlling the airlock and Crisler's marines are sucked out into space.

However, Crisler soon recaptures them. He reveals that the shack is not the true treasure, but the cycler mother seeds, one of which can regrow a complete cycler construction system. He plans to 
reverse engineer
 the technology and use it to wipe out the rebels and their worlds. Since the ships would be unable to distinguish between Rebel and alien worlds, this would amount to genocide on a universal scale. They also discover that the shack was not built by Lasa, but renegade Chicxulub, who embraced the Lasa philosophy.

Crisler's new cycler finishes and the shack launches it. Rue and company escape from Crisler by cutting loose a habitat. Barendts leaves with the seed and Michael pursues him. Rue leaves the habitat to get one of the interceptors and meets Michael, returning with the seed.

Later, Rue and her crew watch as Crisler's cycler is launched from the system. The power tethers have redirected power back into one of the dwarfs to create a massive flare to use as an energy beam.

On Erythrion, Rue announces her plan to revitalize the Cycler Compact, since the Lasa/Chicxulub technology means that the Halo worlds will at last be able to launch their own cyclers.

Rue, however, is already planning her voyage to New Armstrong to reclaim the 
Envy
 and capture Crisler and Mallory."

Twenty-eight years have passed since the events of 
Babylon's Ashes
,
 and no one has heard from Admiral Winston Duarte and his rogue fleet in the decades since they broke away from the Martian Congressional Republic Navy and journeyed through the Laconia gate. They have spent their time in the Laconia system building an advanced fleet using leftover technology from the Protomolecule's creators, along with the sample of the Protomolecule they 
stole
 from Fred Johnson on Tycho. Duarte uses the Protomolecule to massively extend his life, planning to become the immortal emperor of the 1,300 worlds joined by the gates.  

Meanwhile, back in the Solar System, Earth is back on its feet after the attack that crippled the planet. The crew of the aging gunship 
Rocinante
 (Holden, Naomi, Alex, Amos, Clarissa, and Bobbie) are still together, working contracts for the Transport Union, who control trade through the Slow Zone and the worlds the gates lead to. After receiving a morally dubious order to blockade trade to an entire system from union president Camina Drummer, upon returning to Medina, Holden and Naomi decide to retire and hand over the 
Rocinante's
 captaincy to Bobbie. 

The Laconians send out a message announcing the end of their self-imposed exile and send an enormous, incredibly advanced battleship, 
Heart of the Tempest,
 through their gate to capture Medina station. The battleship obliterates the railgun emplacements installed in the Slow Zone using a new magnetic weapon that can disintegrate matter at the atomic level, and easily takes control of the station.  

A Laconian navy commander, Santiago Singh, is made governor of Medina. At first, Singh tries to govern Medina station fairly, but after a failed assassination attempt he is shaken and becomes paranoid, having never been in combat before. His orders become increasingly ruthless, including creating public prisons, strictly limiting communications, and enforcing heavy curfews and censorship. Singh also fires his head of Security, drawing rebukes from his superiors. The crew of the 
Rocinante
 become part of a resistance movement on Medina station, which is headed by Saba (Drummer's husband). 

The 
Tempest
 leaves Medina to conquer the Solar System ahead of schedule, leaving a single small gunship, the 
Gathering Storm
, to defend the station while another battleship, the 
Typhoon
, is dispatched from Laconia. The 
Rocinante
 crew help the resistance with a plan to steal vital intelligence about the Laconian military and their advanced weapons. They steal Laconian encryption codes, disguising their intentions by using a carefully placed bomb as a distraction, hoping this will fool the Laconians into believing they were committing a terrorist attack and not a theft. The plan goes awry and Holden has to manually set off station alarms to maintain the distraction, which results in his capture. His intervention succeeds however and the Laconians do not realize their encryption codes have been stolen. This allows the remaining crew of the 
Rocinante
 to decrypt the station's security data, and begin to form a plan to free Holden and escape.  

In the Solar System, the 
Tempest
 decimates the combined fleets of Earth, Mars, and the Transport Union. However, when the 
Tempest
 uses its magnetic weapon, everyone in the Solar System blacks out for several minutes. The 
Tempest
 crew then discover a strange artifact that has appeared on board their ship, a sphere of the same floating matter that had destroyed the alien technology on 
Ilus
 decades before. On Medina station, Singh interrogates Holden, one of the only witnesses to the artifact on Ilus, and learns that the artifact on board the 
Tempest
 came from the same race that killed the Protomolecule builders. Realizing that Holden has a unique insight into this mysterious race, Singh has him shipped to Laconia.  

Back in the Solar System, as the 
Tempest
 crosses the asteroid belt, the entire combined fleet mounts a final stand against it, using atomic weapons that would destroy any other ship. The 
Tempest
 somehow survives the attack. Although it  does not use its magnetic weapon again, it is still able to decimate the combined fleet. After realizing that the ship cannot be stopped, Drummer surrenders, and the governments of Earth and Mars quickly follow, letting Laconia take control of the Solar System. 

On Medina, the resistance decodes the intelligence they stole and formulates a plan to evacuate as many people from the station as possible, where they will scatter through the ring gates to other colonies before the 
Typhoon
 can arrive. The plan is for Saba to release all prisoners on the station to sow chaos while the resistance takes control of the docks. Meanwhile Alex in the 
Rocinante
 will distract the 
Gathering Storm
 while a boarding team led by Bobbie and Amos take control of the Laconian gunship, allowing the other ships docked at the station to escape. Clarissa and Naomi will disable the station's sensors so that the Laconians cannot tell which gates the evacuating ships have gone through.  

Although the first part of the plan works, Naomi and Clarissa are betrayed by a double agent in the resistance, informing Singh who sets up an ambush. Clarissa uses her blackmarket adrenal gland mods to kill the ambush team of Laconian marines, but dies as a result. Bobbie leads the assault on the 
Gathering Storm
 and takes control of the ship. She is joined by the 
Rocinante
 and others and they escape the Slow Zone and go into hiding on a colony called Freehold. After the massive security failure, Singh instructs his security chief to cull the remaining population on Medina. Instead, the chief informs Singh that he has been instructed by Duarte to kill him for his failure to stamp out the resistance, and shoots him.  

In the epilogue, Holden arrives as a prisoner on Laconia. He meets Duarte, and attempts to warn him of the danger the protomolecule-destroying artifact on the 
Tempest
 poses. Duarte ignores his concerns, reveals he plans to use the Protomolecule as a weapon to rule all of humanity, and asks Holden to join him."

The novel focuses around Don Halifax and his wife of sixty years, Sarah, an astronomer who translated the first transmission sent from an extraterrestrial source to Earth 38 years prior to the opening of the story. Sarah, now 87, is tasked to decode the second message sent from the unknown alien race—if she can live long enough to do so. A wealthy industrial billionaire, Cody McGavin, offers to put up billions of dollars to perform a ""rollback"" on not only Sarah but Don as well. This process, which reverts a person's body to its condition when the subject was 25 years old, is successfully performed on Don, but fails to work with Sarah. This leaves Sarah gradually creeping toward death while Don's life begins anew. Much of the story focuses on Don as he discovers the advantages and disadvantages of being young again, with periodic flashbacks to when Sarah translated the first alien message."

Alien
 activity is discovered in a 
Kirkwood gap
; the aliens are identified as 
self-replicating machines
 (
von Neumann probes
). Their activity is potentially an immense threat, as Malenfant notes in an earlier speech: ""A target system, we assume, is uninhabited. We can therefore program for massive and destructive exploitation of the system's resources, without restraint, by the 
probe
. Such resources are useless for any other purpose, and are therefore economically free to us. And so we colonize, and build.""

The 
self-replicating spacecraft
 are named 
Gaijin
 (Japanese for ""foreigner""), after their discovery by a Japanese observer on the Moon.  Malenfant travels in a prototype fusion engine to the Kirkwood Gap and discovers an interstellar teleportation device. He travels around the galaxy to uncover information about the Fermi paradox (see below). At the same time, the story also follows the efforts of Humans on Earth and the eventual draining of the Earth's resources, making a move off-world necessary.  At the same time a small group of humans use 
anti-aging
 techniques and an alien form of interstellar 
teleportation

 to ""parachute"" in on the changing solar system over many centuries.

Eventually, it is revealed that in this version of the 
Fermi paradox

sentient
 life is endemic throughout the universe; Humanity simply had not noticed it earlier because the universe destroys any race before it becomes advanced enough to develop a 
Type IV civilisation
.  The story ends with Malenfant helping the Gaijin build a shield to prevent a 
pulsar
 from sterilising a large part of the galaxy. Although this project will not be completed before another predicted pulsar event wipes out all extant species, it is hoped to give the sentient aliens who develop from the aftermath of the coming extinction a better chance at long-term survival.

Peter Leigh, an English pastor, decides to leave his wife Beatrice in order to be a missionary. It is gradually revealed that rather than being a missionary in a different country, he has been hired by USIC, a private American corporation, to preach to the population of a distant planet, Oasis. Peter expects to find hostility when meeting the natives, but he finds instead that they are extremely welcoming, already speak English very well and are passionate devotees of the Christian faith, referring to themselves as Jesus Lover One, Two, et cetera. Peter sets to work trying to build a church for the Jesus Lovers and trying to live amongst them. 

On his brief trips back to the base camp where the engineers and scientist who run USIC on Oasis live, he tries to contact Bea using a Shoot, a message system which allows him to communicate back on Earth. Though Bea's initial messages are full of love, they also include information on severe natural disasters caused by 
climate change
, including flooding and famine that have happened since Peter left. After a few months, she also informs Peter that she is pregnant with his child, conceived on the last night he was with her. Peter, whose life is full with his missionary work, feels distant from Bea and begins to find it difficult to recall her face and their life together, instead focusing on integrating himself into the Oasan community. 

While helping the Oasans with a harvest, which they trade with the USIC population for medicine, Peter receives a terrible bite from an Oasan pest. The community is horrified and treat him as though he is dying. Peter believes he has been poisoned, but nevertheless he goes back to USIC, where he is treated for his wounds and receives a message from Bea telling him that there is no God. In distress, Peter decides to go back to the Oasan village in order to die, but he accidentally finds the village they abandoned before he arrived, where he meets the linguist that was his predecessor. The linguist warns him that the USIC workers are not as harmonious as they appear and that Earth is dying. 

The following day, he is retrieved by Grainger, the USIC pharmacist with whom he is closest. Grainger implies Peter may have been hallucinating as he was severely dehydrated. Back at the USIC base camp, he learns that his favorite Oasan, Jesus Lover Five, has come to the base camp seeking treatment, as a fallen painting which bruised her hand has led to her dying. Peter realizes with horror that the reason Oasans have embraced Jesus so much is because they are terribly vulnerable to injury and death, and they take the tales of healing miracles, Heaven and Jesus rising from the grave literally.

Based on Bea's attitude and the fact that he has unintentionally deceived the Oasans, Peter decides to return to Earth. He visits the Oasan town once more where his congregation, who last saw him receiving severe injuries, treat his return as a miracle. As a parting gift to them, he tries to explain that humans are capable of recovering from injuries in a way the Oasans are not, but they remain faithful Christians nevertheless. Before he leaves for Earth, Peter receives a last message from Bea which tells him to stay where he is, as she has to relocate and Earth is unsafe. However, Peter is resolved to return to her and their unborn child and remain with them even until the end of the world."

Two years pass after the Battle on Starship Hill on Tines World. The exiled Tine pack Vendacious travels to the city of East Home, seeking to ally with Tycoon, the world's richest businessman. Over the next year, Vendacious helps Tycoon expand his enterprise (using a stolen human dataset) and undertake an expedition to the Tropical Choir, a legendary mob of over one hundred million Tines living in the world's equatorial region. Meanwhile, Ravna Bergsndot has slowly begun reviving the human Children who have been kept in cold sleep pods since their flight from High Lab and the Blight at the galaxy's edge. Although the Blight was effectively destroyed by Countermeasure, its fleet survives stranded 30 light-years away from Tines World, presumably developing ramscoop technology to resume its journey. Ravna hopes to use the technical archives on the crippled 
Out of Band II
 (
Oobii
) to elevate Woodcarver's Domain and Tines World to a level of technology advanced enough to combat the Blight's remnant. The Blight may yet take decades or even centuries to arrive, but when the Zone boundaries briefly shift, those estimates become questionable.

Ten years after the Battle on Starship Hill, Ravna's plans begin to crumble. She learns of a faction of Children calling themselves the Disaster Study Group who believe that the Blight's fleet is a rescue party sent for them, and that Countermeasure, having destroyed countless civilizations by moving the Slow Zone to quell the Blight, is the true evil. When Ravna tries to explain to an assembly of Children the importance of adhering to her schedule for advancing Tines World, she is upstaged and betrayed by Nevil Storherte, who convinces most of the Children that Ravna is obsessed and misguided, and that he should be the one to lead them. Nevil then forces Ravna to turn over 
sysadmin
 authority of 
Oobii
 to him, granting him access to its archives, systems, and weapons; however, Ravna secretly retains Command Privilege over the starship, a status that supersedes sysadmin.

Support for Nevil's leadership begins to falter as the medical advances he promised fail to bear fruit. Ravna conspires with Johanna Olsndot and the pack Pilgrim to force Nevil to compromise. Before that can happen, three of the youngest Children are kidnapped, ostensibly by Tines from the Tropics. Nevil uses the opportunity to leverage more power. Later, while Johanna and Pilgrim travel to investigate the Tropics, Ravna is kidnapped herself, and Johanna and Pilgrim crash into Tycoon's Reservation in the Tropics. It is revealed that Nevil was behind all three incidents and for several years has been allied with Tycoon and Vendacious to undermine Ravna and Woodcarver. In the Tropics, Pilgrim is lost to the Choir and Johanna escapes aboard a Tropical trade convoy bound for Woodcarver's Domain. Ravna, with the help of Jefri Olsndot, his friend pack Amdiranifani, and the pack Screwfloss (a rehabilitated Lord Steel), escapes her captors and attempts to return to Woodcarver's Domain to stop Nevil's tyranny. On the way, however, the four are re-captured and taken to the Tropics aboard two of Tycoon's airships. Back on 
Oobii
, now under Nevil's control, Nevil's second-in-command Bili Yngva witnesses a massive Zone shift recorded by the ship's sensors. For a few minutes, Tines World is part of the Beyond and the ""rescue party"" fleet is estimated to close to within 20 light-years.

Ravna and company arrive at Tycoon's Reservation, where they learn that Tycoon, under Vendacious' influence, is on the verge of forcing Woodcarver to accede to an alliance, thereby removing Woodcarver's Domain as a threat to Tycoon's rapidly growing business empire. Later, when the meeting that Nevil had coordinated to force the ""alliance"" on Woodcarver and solidify his control over the Children occurs, it ends disastrously for him. Ravna regains control of 
Oobii
 with her Command Privilege, Vendacious is killed by a mutiny of his airship's crew, and Tycoon flees to the Tropics with Johanna (whom Tycoon believes to have killed his brother-pack, Scriber Jaqueramaphan) as an apparent hostage. Nevil and his fellow Disaster Study Group members (nearly half of all the Children) depart and establish their own settlement, ""Best Hope"", in a distant valley. Sometime later, Nevil announces that he remains allied with Tycoon, and Tycoon will soon return several hostages taken over the years: the two survivors among the Children kidnapped earlier, and the packs Amdiranifani and Screwfloss. Ravna and Jefri are disappointed when Johanna is not returned as well, but Johanna secretly reveals to Ravna that she has since become Tycoon's advisor and that their support of Nevil is a temporary ruse. In reality, Tycoon is forging a business partnership with Woodcarver and Ravna, who can provide technical expertise from 
Oobii
.

The story concludes as Johanna, in the Tropics with Tycoon, speculates that with Tycoon's industrial power and the condensed information of countless civilizations in 
Oobii'
s archives, decades' worth of technological progress could be made in a couple of years. In Woodcarver's Domain, Ravna prays that Tines World will be ready for the Blight, which to her knowledge is still 30 light-years away."

The Eusistocratic Republic of Finland holds their citizens' health above all else, even to an extreme measure. Men and women deemed unfit (""minus men"" and ""neuterwomen"", or ""morlocks""; as opposed to the acceptable ""mascos"" and ""femiwomen"", or ""eloi"") are not allowed to reproduce or participate fully in society. The novel follows Vera, renamed Vanna by the government, a morlock that has been raised by her grandmother, Aulikki, as an eloi to provide her more opportunities in life. This disguised morlock combats her oppression and the pain of losing her missing sister, Mira/Manna, by ingesting illegal chile peppers that she obtains with the help of her partner, Jare.

Mira, renamed Manna by the government of Finland, is a true eloi and serves as a model for Vanna's behaviors. She goes missing after marrying Harri Nissila and moving back to her childhood home of Neulapää. Harri is found guilty of her murder after her hair and blood are found in the trunk of his car, but Manna's body is never found. This leaves Vanna with a sense of unrest, which leads to her chili pepper addiction.

Jare, a former farmhand at Vanna and Manna's childhood home of Neulapää, becomes Vanna's partner in crime after discovering her true nature. He loves Vanna, and helps her obtain the chile peppers she desires, maintain her image as an innocent eloi, and tries to help find Manna after her mysterious disappearance—putting himself in danger at every juncture. As the government begins to crack down and chile pepper suppliers run dry, Jare discovers a drug ring fronting as a religious group—the Gaians.

The Gaians consist of three members: Mirko, Valtteri, Terhi. After their business takes off, Vanna and Jare get married and move back to the farm at Neulapää. The Gaians conclude that their profits would be maximized by moving their business to Neulapää to grow their own chili peppers. Although it appears the Gaians are interested in lucrative gain, their true intentions are to create a hybrid chili pepper that allows the capso to 
transcend
 their physical body, similar to 
shamanism
. This is achieved when Vanna ingests a pepper named ""The Core of the Sun"". She has an out-of-body experience where she momentarily becomes one with the world. While Vanna is transcending, Jare is out making a drug deal with a man who responded to his advertisement in the paper. The man, however, pulls a fast one on Jare, physically assaults him, and steals the pepper. Jare leaves the deal in a hurry, suspecting the man was a part of the Finnish government. He rushes back to the farm and orders everyone to leave. Upon departure, the Gaians leave Neulapää, and give Vanna one last dose of The Core of the Sun.

The story culminates when Harri is released from prison and seeks out Jare and Vanna to exact revenge for leading the authorities to him. This happens after Vanna has already ingested her last dose of The Core of the Sun, allowing her to invade Harri's thoughts and prevail against him as well as find out where her sister is. Vanna is then able to find Manna, releasing her from her physical body to join Vanna in her mind where they become Mira and Vera, together as one."

The book's 
frame narrative
 and premise is that ""after dabbling in radical politics"", 
Adolf Hitler
 emigrated to the United States in 1919 and became a science fiction illustrator, editor, and author. He wrote his final 
science fantasy
 novel 
Lord of the Swastika
 in six weeks in 1953, shortly before dying of 
cerebral hemorrhage
[
1
]
 (possibly caused by tertiary 
syphilis
); 
Lord of the Swastika
 subsequently wins the 
Hugo Award
 and the ""colorful uniforms"" described therein become regularly worn by fans at 
science fiction conventions
. Hitler's other published works include the long-running 
fanzine
 
Storm
 and the novels 
The Master Race
, 
The Thousand Year Rule
, and 
The Triumph of the Will
.

In a faux review following the main narrative, presented as written by (fictitious) Dr. Homer Whipple of 
New York University
, we learn more about the background of the alternate history in which Hitler emigrated to the United States. Without Hitler's leadership, the 
Nazi Party
 fell apart in 1923 and the 
Communist Party of Germany
 succeeded in fomenting a German communist revolution in 1930. As this alternate history continues, there is reference to a ""Greater 
Soviet Union
"" which took over the United Kingdom in 1948, and whose influence is growing in Latin America by 1959. Whipple refers to 
World War I
 as ""the Great War"", implying that there has been no equivalent of 
World War II
 in this world. The core element in the historical backstory of 
Lord of the Swastika
 is a 
nuclear apocalypse
 but Whipple gives no indication about such weapons really existing in this alternate reality.

Whipple also discloses that the 
Empire of Japan
 has retained 
its militarism
, with reference to its 
bushido
 code of conduct, while the United States vacillates against the Greater Soviet Union's ascendancy. Due to the Greater Soviet Union threat, the United States and Japan have a close military and strategic alliance. Japanese militarist values are much admired in the United States. Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States (collectively called the Pacific Pact) are the only major powers standing between the Greater Soviet Union and total control of the globe—yet most Americans seem unable to be roused to deal with the looming Soviet danger. Whipple wonders what the emergence of an American leader like Feric Jaggar, the hero of 
Lord of the Swastika
, could accomplish. Finally, there is a casual mention that, while in this history Nazi Germany never came into being, it is the Soviets who have undertaken a systematic genocide of the Jews of Europe in this world's version of the 
Holocaust
.

Lord of the Swastika
 is lauded for its qualities as a great work of 
heroic fantasy
. To further hammer the point, in an early edition, actual science fiction writers wrote fictional statements of praise for ""Hitler's"" writing skills for Spinrad to use as blurbs on the novel's back cover. Irony abounds in Whipple's review, as he argues author Hitler is obviously wrong in assuming that not much more than midnight rallies and 
phallic symbolism
 would create a large number of supporters for a movement.

Lord of the Swastika
 opens in the year 1142 A.F.—""After Fire"", the global 
nuclear war
 referred to as the ""Time of Fire"" which brought about the end of the civilization of the technologically advanced ""Ancients"" and the current despoliation of most forms of life. The 
gene pools
 of almost all life forms are corrupted by the 
radioactive fallout
. Few examples of the baseline human form can be seen, and most of humanity are mutants with blue skins, lizard scales or parrot beaks, or wizened half-breed mutants and normal-seeming but inhuman ""Dominators"", who desire to rule the ruined world with their mind-controlling powers.

The pure and strong young ""Trueman"" (so named for the lack of mutations in his 
DNA
) Feric Jaggar returns from the outlands of Borgravia where his family was exiled by the treaty of Karmak with the surrounding mutant states to his ancestral land, the High Republic of Heldon, which was founded on the principles of killing mutants and keeping humanity pure. He arrives only to find its rigor slackened and corrupted by the ""Universalists"", pawns of the sinister Dominator country Zind, which seeks to corrupt Heldon's pure human gene pool into the mutant diversity that rules the rest of the world. Indeed, in the very first portion of Heldon that Feric enters, the customs fort where entrants are tested to see whether they are pure and free of mutation, he is outraged that mutants are being allowed into Heldon on day-passes, that the fort is under the spell of a Dominator, and that the tests are so lax that impure specimens are being granted citizenship.

In Heldon proper, Feric dines in the ""
Eagle's Nest
"" tavern, and mulls over the question of how to change this situation. Should he enter politics or the military? Feric witnesses the oratory of Seph Bogel, leader of the Human Renaissance Party, who speaks eloquently but ineffectually to the crowd about the need for human purity. Fired by his words, Feric is inspired to take control of the listening crowd and leads a mob to the same border post, there to slay the Dominator (or ""Dom"") who had quietly disguised himself as a clerk to sway the immigration decisions in favor of mutants. At Bogel's invitation, he assumes leadership of the Party, which Feric later renames The Sons of the Swastika, and the two travel on to Walder—the second city of Heldon—to meet the party inner circle and begin the great task.

Their journey is interrupted when their steam-powered vessel is waylaid by the outlaw petrol-powered 
motorcycle gang
, the Black Avengers. Jaggar, however, senses that these men may be of use to his cause and challenges their leader, Stag Stopa. The rules of the Black Avengers only allow a member to challenge the leader, and so he and Bogel are taken back to their headquarters for Feric to be initiated. Feric acquits himself mainly in the drinking of 
ale
 and in running the gauntlet of torches on a motorcycle. He and Stopa duel with truncheons, and Feric's truncheon breaks. Desperately he reaches out and picks up the ""Great Truncheon of Stag Held"" lying nearby—which can only be wielded by a descendant of the last true King of Heldon, Sigmark IV. The Black Avengers immediately pledge fealty to him, and become the ""Knights of the Swastika"".

From this event, Jaggar assumes a hereditary right to be the leader of Heldon and embarks on a violent crusade for genetic purity, drawing a massive following, staging outdoor rallies and raising an army personally loyal to him. He is elected to the Council and stages a coup d'état when he forces the Council to admit to treason and a Zind plot against Heldon. Confirming his suspicions, the Universalist member of the Council turns out to be a Dom. Feric summarily executes him with the Great Truncheon. Jaggar coerces the Council into granting him complete executive power and then has them shot. Immediately after assuming power Jaggar 
puts down an imminent coup by Stopa
, who has been corrupted by the fleshly pleasures of Zind.

Backed by the army and the adoring multitudes, Feric sets about the great task of re-invigorating the military, ordering the production of tanks and fighter jets, the establishment of the Swastika Squad (
SS
)—a legion of the purest and most manly men that can be found via the ""Classification Camps"", which examine all citizens of Heldon (killing the Doms and sterilizing or exiling all relatively impure humans). After repelling a Zind attack through Wolack, Heldon 
annexes its western and southern neighbors
, beginning with Borgravia. In the course of the Helderisation of its neighbors Jaggar orders, at the suggestion of Bors Remler, that all mutants are to be euthanised rather than exiled.

Months later, his scientists report that they are near to rediscovering the secrets of atomic bombs, but that Zind is making efforts to dig up relics of the Ancients, which might salvage its own complement of nuclear weaponry. Noting the damage such weapons had done, Feric orders such research ended, and determines to wipe out Zind and every last Dom before they can unleash the Fire.  Soon enough, Zind begins to rally its troops from their reverse in Wolack. The final invasion of Zind is hard fought: the main Helder force, under the command of Lar Waffing, takes the southwestern oil fields needed for resupply, while the secondary force fights a delaying action against the vast bulk of the Zind army to the north towards the Zind capital, Bora. Needless to say, the forces of Heldon prevail and the Zind army is destroyed and burned, down to the last mindless ""Warrior"". The central city is reduced to a cinder in a firestorm (akin to the 
bombing of Dresden
 in our world).

The last Dom, apparently a leader and with immense mental powers, is discovered hiding in a command bunker. The Dom has anticipated military defeat and, before Feric has the pleasure of killing him, triumphantly reveals that the Doms had salvaged and rearmed one of the ancient nuclear weapons. It is a 
doomsday weapon
, and he triggers the failsafe. After Feric and his cohorts have evacuated Bora, a 
cobalt bomb
 detonates, and as the Dom planned, its fallout utterly corrupts the gene pool of Heldon. If any of its citizens, including Feric, reproduce, they will produce the mutants that they had previously sought to obliterate.

Feric orders the sterilization of the entire Heldon nation, including himself, and, in a final desperate gamble, orders the SS scientists to redouble their efforts to develop the next 
Master Race
 from 
cloning
 the perfect specimens of the SS. Eventually they succeed and millions of the new master race are produced in 'reproduction works' to complete the cleansing of the Earth. At the novel's close, Heldon has mastered 
interstellar travel
. As a consequence, an initial starship, full of 300 of these seven-foot, blond, super-intelligent all-male SS clones in 
suspended animation
, is launched into space to initiate Heldon's own 
galactic empire
. The SS clones also have a clone of Feric to lead them. This inaugural rocket is launched on a voyage to 
Tau Ceti
 and will become the first of many.

""Indeed, in the book Hitler seems to assume that masses of men in fetishistic uniforms marching in precise displays and displaying phallic gestures and paraphernalia will have a powerful appeal to ordinary human beings. Feric Jaggar comes to power in Heldon through little more than a grotesque series of increasingly grandiose phallic displays. This is undoubtedly phallic fetishism on the part of the author, since the alternative conclusion is to accept the ridiculous notion that an entire nation would throw itself at the feet of a leader simply on the basis of mass displays of public fetishism, orgies of blatant phallic symbolism, and mass rallies enlivened with torchlight and rabid oratory. Obviously, such a mass national psychosis could never occur in the real world..."" pg 249

The Parijatdvipan Empire rules over several vassal states, including Ahiranya. Ahiranya’s native language, religion, and culture have been suppressed; this has led to instability and rebellion. A new disease called the rot, which causes plants to sprout from one's body, is leading to further stress.

Within an Ahiranyi temple called the Hirana, there is a source of power known as the deathless waters. By passing through the waters once, twice, or thrice, Ahiranyi temple children risked their lives in exchange for gaining magical powers related to the 
yaksa
, nature spirits. During the Parijati conquest, some of the Ahiranyi elders betrayed their companions; most of the elders and temple children were massacred.

Prince Aditya leaves the traditional Parijati religion to become a priest of the nameless god, a religion belonging to the region of Alor. His brother Chandra ascends to the throne. Chandra is a religious fanatic and attempts to impose his beliefs on the empire. Malini, Emperor Chandra’s sister, refuses to sacrifice herself in a religious ritual and is exiled. A group of dissidents, led by Prince Rao of Alor, attempts to free Malini and place Aditya on the throne.

Malini is imprisoned in the Hirana. Priya is a former temple child who survived the massacre. She is a servant in the household of General Vikram, the Parijati Regent of Ahiranya, and his wife Bhumika. Priya saves Malini from an assassination attempt and becomes her personal maid.

Ashok, the leader of a group of resistance fighters, is Priya’s older brother and another surviving temple child. He and his rebels hope to violently overthrow the occupying government. Ashok and his rebels drink their last supply from the deathless waters; they gain powers, but will die if they cannot replenish their store from the Hirana. Bhumika reveals herself as a surviving temple child and has Vikram executed, consolidating power for herself.

In exchange for independence for Ahiranya, Priya agrees to help Malini escape. Before they flee the Hirana, Priya seals the path to the deathless waters so that Ashok cannot reach them. Malini and Priya flee toward the city-state of Srugna and begin a romance. Bhumika, Priya, and Malini meet with Rao and Aditya. Priya agrees to save Ashok and his rebels on the condition that they recognize Bhumika as leader. Malini remains with her brother as the others return to Ahiranya.

Priya’s group returns to the Hirana. She and Bhumika become thrice-born, but Ashok dies in the attempt. Bhumika and Priya become elders, reinstating the traditional Ahiranyi religion.

Emperor Chandra sends a battalion to attack Aditya. The weak-willed Aditya is unwilling to sacrifice his soldiers, but Malini takes control, burning the temple of the nameless god to the ground. This kills all of Chandra’s soldiers, as well as some of Aditya’s priests. Malini claims power and is proclaimed as Empress."

Jamie Gray goes to a six-month performance review as an employee for food delivery startup füdmüd expecting to impress boss Rob Sanders with plans to grow the company, only to be terminated and offered a delivery contract instead. At first rejecting the offer, Jamie is eventually forced to take it after all to make rent, as jobs are scarce in 
COVID-19-afflicted New York City
. One delivery client turns out to be Tom Stevens, an old acquaintance, and over the next few weeks of deliveries they renew their friendship. Tom has a lucrative position with KPS, a secretive animal rights 
NGO
, and is slated to head out into the field right about the same time Jamie loses the delivery job (füdmüd having been bought out). Tom offers Jamie a job with his own employer, and Jamie, again out of options, goes in for the interview, is accepted, and is soon on a plane to 
Thule Air Base
 in 
Greenland
.

Thule Air Base turns out to hide the gateway to a 
parallel Earth
, in which evolution took a different turn after the early 
Mesozoic
 era, resulting in a planet dominated by impossibly immense creatures whose growth is fueled by internal bio-
nuclear reactors
. Mankind first became aware of this world in the wake of 
World War II
, when the use of 
atomic bombs
 opened temporary portals between the worlds, to and through which the creatures were attracted by the radiation fallout, on which they feed. After 
Japanese
 filmmakers were inspired by rumors of the initial breakthrough to make ""
Kaiju
"" movies such as 
Godzilla
 and its successors, the creatures were dubbed Kaiju. Aside from such rumors, their real-life existence has been kept secret by governments around the world, who formed KPS (the Kaiju Preservation Society) to study the Kaiju Earth, prevent additional breakthroughs, and protect the denizens of each world from those of the other.

Kaiju Earth is a torrid world, high in oxygen and radioactive volatiles, dominated by Kaiju and teeming with lesser predators. Sent to Tanaka Base, an outpost in the Kaiju Earth version of 
Labrador
, Jamie supports the scientific staff studying the biota there, particularly the Kaiju ""Bella,"" a brooding mother laying her eggs at the irradiated site of the death of another Kaiju, whose internal atomic pile overheated and exploded—a not infrequent occurrence. Unfortunately, this event weakened the barrier between worlds, and Bella planting herself at the very location the event occurred is keeping the barrier from rehealing. A predatory corporation on the Human Earth side (coincidentally led by Jamie's old boss Rob Sanders), in on the Kaiju secret, takes the opportunity to breach the barrier and move the Kaiju mother and her eggs to the Human side. Jamie and the other KPS team members must somehow cross over themselves and recover Bella, both to preserve the Kaiju secret and protect both worlds from catastrophe."

The novel is broken into 11 parts of varying lengths. The story itself is broken into two sections: the first and shorter section covers the origins of the virus and its outbreak, while the second is set 93 years after the infections, primarily following a colony of survivors living in California. Several narrative devices are used, including email, journal entries, newspaper reports, and 
other documents
.  Occasional use is made of reference material from 1,000 years after the outbreak, coming from 
""The Journal of Sara Fisher""
, sourced from a future ""University of New South Wales, Indo-Australian Republic"".

The U.S. government is conducting a top secret experiment referred to as ""Project Noah"" which involves acquiring and transporting death row inmates to a secret military compound in Colorado, ostensibly for the purposes of testing a drug intended to greatly prolong life. These genetic experiments originate from 
patient zero
, Tim Fanning—one of two surviving members of an expedition investigating a Bolivian bat-carried virus. The virus, while causing 
hemorrhagic fever
 and death in those who initially contracted it, results in a boosting of the immune system and enhanced strength and agility in the current subjects. It is later revealed that Project Noah is intended to produce weaponized enhanced humans for the military, described as ""the ultimate 
bunker busters
"".

The FBI agents responsible for recruiting the prisoners are ordered to collect six-year-old Amy Bellafonte from a 
convent
 and deliver her to Dr. Lear, the head of the project.  At Noah she is exposed to a refined version of the serum administered to ""The Twelve""—the original inmates. Lear theorizes that as Amy's immune system has not had the chance to mature it will form a symbiosis with the virus and live with her symbiotically, instead of the violent forms it has taken with the other twelve.

Of the inmates, the first and last recruited are depicted as being different from the others: Babcock, the original test subject, is stronger and appears to have developed psychic abilities, occasionally influencing his guards and cleaners; and Carter, who was convicted of a 
first-degree murder
 he did not commit.

Zero (AKA Fanning) and the other twelve inmates mentally take control of their guards and escape their quarantine cells, rapidly killing all who stand in their way.  Amy is rescued by Brad Wolgast (the FBI agent who brought her to Noah) and Sister Lacey (a nun who was looking after Amy when she was recruited). Lacey is taken by Carter, as Wolgast and Amy escape to a mountain retreat where they live for several months, occasionally picking up news of the contagion spread throughout America. The rest of the world's fate is not stated, but it is mentioned that most European nations have imposed quarantine and closed their borders.

Despite living reasonably comfortably in the mountain site, Wolgast eventually succumbs to radiation sickness when a nuclear device is detonated nearby—he assumes that the government is attempting to sterilize infected areas of the country—and Amy is left to fend for herself.

The novel shifts forward in time approximately 93 years (with occasional reference retrospectively 1,000 years in the future), and the narrative is taken up around a self-sufficient, walled, 
isolationist
 colony established by the military in conjunction with 
FEMA
 not long after the initial outbreak. The First Colony is in slow decline, although only one character (a technician by the name of Michael Fisher) seems to recognize this; he is trying to establish clandestine radio contact with the outside world to obtain spares for their failing equipment—specifically their 
batteries
 which power the high-wattage lights which protect the colony from the 
virals
, who in traditional vampiric style are highly light-sensitive.

During a nighttime attack, Amy arrives at the gates of the camp, having previously met Peter Jaxon (one of the colony's senior figures) during a foraging expedition. Amy's arrival also results in a break-in from the virals leading to the death of ""Teacher""—the person responsible for the upbringing of all the children under eight in the colony.  Amy now appears to be a fifteen-year-old girl, and upon her arrival is grievously wounded by a crossbow, but her own recuperative powers soon heal her and within days she is as healthy as she was before being injured.

Amy's arrival, her healing abilities, Teacher's death and inner-colony friction (caused by Babcock's mental influence over several Colony figures) force several of the colony dwellers to abscond with Amy and seek out another military site in Colorado—from where Michael has been receiving faint radio signals.

Amy demonstrates a psychic bond with the virals, and manages to keep the group of travelers relatively safe during their journey. They come across another settlement established in a Las Vegas prison, known as the Haven, which, while initially welcoming, is in fact Babcock's lair. The Haven's residents, most under the mental influence of Babcock, ""feed"" him blood sacrifices in exchange for being left alone by the horde of virals at his disposal, referred to as ""The Many"" (as opposed to The Twelve).

Theo Jaxon, Peter's brother who had been captured by virals months earlier, has been imprisoned here. Babcock is slowly attempting to grasp hold of his mind to make him a Familiar, but because he does not give in, he is served as a sacrifice. After resisting Babcock's mental influence, Theo and Mausami (his pregnant lover) are rescued by Peter.

During a botched attempt to kill Babcock during one of the monthly blood sacrifice rituals, sympathizers at the Haven enable the group to escape via railroad, and they arrive at a farmstead. Theo and Maus stay behind so that the baby can be born safely while the rest of the group continue on and eventually meet up with a Texan military group, who provide assistance to Peter and Amy in finding the Colorado outpost.  The others stay with the military group, headed to 
Kerrville
 but are confronted with Babcock's ""Many"" heading over the mountain, so the core friends, along with Major Greer, decide to change course to head for the Colorado outpost instead. The bulk of the military group still continue to Kerrville. Once at the outpost, Peter discovers that it is the same compound where the outbreak started, and still serves as home to Sister Lacey. Lacey, like Amy, was treated by Lear with a modified form of the serum, providing her with longer life and a psychic bond with not only Amy and the virals, but Babcock as well.

It is decided they will lure Babcock into the outpost—Amy and Lacey confirm that he is headed towards them in any case—where they will detonate a nuclear device originally designed to sterilize the compound, but never used. The group theorize that the virals are like a hive mind and once Babcock is dead his hold over the virals created 
exponentially
 by him will cease and they will no longer be a threat. Lacey hands over files on The Twelve, revealing their hometowns, to which she suggests The Twelve will have returned. She also hands over a case of 12 syringes full of the modified serum. While waiting for Babcock to arrive, the group is attacked, resulting in Alicia (""Lish"") becoming infected, and treated by Sara, Michael Fisher's sister and the former medic of the First Colony, with 1 of the 12 syringes of the modified serum.

Upon Babcock's arrival, Lacey lures him to a chamber where she detonates the bomb, destroying herself, Babcock, and much of the outpost. Once Babcock is dead, Amy is finally able to know the virals lives and gives them back memories, telling them who they are. The attacking virals all collapse and willingly wait for the sun to rise so they can die, in most cases leaving behind nothing but dust, proving the hive theory correct.

Lish adapts to the virus in a similar manner to Amy and Lacey before her, yet with differences—she has limited psychic abilities, but has the strength and endurance of a viral.  Greer comments that she would be a formidable soldier—suggesting that Lish has become the first true ""super soldier"" that the government was trying to develop 93 years ago.

The group return to Theo and Maus at the farmstead, where the baby, named Caleb, has been born safely but they relay a strange story about being attacked by a viral and neither remembering killing it, though it has a shotgun blast through its chest. Peter and Lish realize the dead viral is actually Maus's husband, Galen Strauss who was turned since she left the Colony and either sought her out or just happened upon them at the farm. The friends stay for a while, making sure Theo and family have enough food stocked since Theo's leg was broken during the fight with the viral. The group begins discussing the idea of using the rest of the modified serum to raise more super soldiers to fight Zero, but Amy throws them all into the fire, citing concerns about sharing her miserable curse with other people and losing humanity. The next day the main group departs on foot, heading back to the First Colony, while Theo and his family, along with Hollis and Sara in the 
Humvee
, head off to Kerrville.

Amy, Peter, Michael, Greer and Lish, after months of walking, return to the First Colony only to find it deserted, with no sign of what happened or where the colonists may have gone.  There are two bodies, a victim of a suicide and that of Auntie, who seemingly died of old age. They decide to hunt down the remaining Twelve using Lear's files to determine their locations, and Lish as their primary weapon.  That night Amy meets the infected Wolgast, outside the Colony.

The other group is able to meet up with the Texan Expeditionary force, and their remaining story is related through parts of Sara's diary—her last entry is at Roswell Base, and among comments about her own pregnancy she states that she can hear gunshots, and is going to investigate.  This entry is presented as part of the future reference material, and is stated to have come from the site of ""The Roswell Massacre"".  The novel ends ambiguously for all surviving characters."

The novel begins sometime in the near-future in a small town in rural America. Flynne Fisher works at a local 3D printing shop and lives with her mother and her brother Burton, who sustained brain trauma from 
cybernetic
 implants he received while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps' elite 
Haptic
 Recon unit. When Burton heads to another town to counter-protest the protests of a religious extremist group known as Luke 4:5, he asks her to take over his job working security in a video game/virtual world for a supposedly Colombian company called Milagros Coldiron. Flynne takes the job and notices the game world looks suspiciously like London, but far more empty and more futuristic. Piloting a security 
quadcopter
, she fends off 
paparazzi
 drones from an unknown woman's high-rise apartment. On the second night of doing so she witnesses a man and a woman out on a balcony, where the woman is apparently killed and gruesomely devoured by a swarm of 
nanobots
; Flynne is uncertain whether this is real or part of a virtual game.

The novel alternates between Flynne's experiences and those of Wilf Netherton, a publicist who lives in the early 22nd century, seventy years later than Flynne's time, and several decades after an apocalyptic period known as the Jackpot took place. As the book begins, Wilf is working with Daedra West, an American artist/celebrity/diplomat, on establishing relations with a group of deformed native humans known as ""Patchers,"" on an enormous cultivated 
garbage patch
 in the Pacific Ocean. However, Daedra's reckless behavior triggers her personal security system, killing all the Patchers and their boss, Hamed al-Habib. Wilf is fired (he assumes; he doesn't check his mail) and goes to his friend Lev Zubov's house. Lev, the son of a powerful and wealthy Russian family that moved to Britain several generations ago, is a ""continua enthusiast."" He has introduced Wilf to ""stubs"" which are alternate pasts whose futures begin to deviate from the ones that lead to his and Wilf's present at the moment contact is made from their present - a contact only possible in a data sense and only made possible by a mysterious quantum computer running in China. Milagros Coldiron is Zubov's front organization for accessing the stub in which Flynne and Burton live. Inhabitants of Flynne's time are able to access the early 22nd century of Zubov and Netherton via headsets built using a 3D printer and technological know-how passed back to them from the 22nd century.  These headsets allow the wearer's consciousness to inhabit and control a 'peripheral' a.k.a. an artificial physical human body in the 22nd century.  Using this technology, Wilf had hired Burton Fisher from his stub to act as drone security for Daedra's sister, Aelita, as a novelty gift to her.

When Aelita goes missing, Wilf realizes that the drones controlled by Flynne were the only witness of the event while all other recording devices were disabled.

Returning from his trip, Burton tells Flynne that Milagros Coldiron wants to speak with her. Via a video call, she tells Wilf and the others about what she saw on the tower, but Wilf is reluctant to tell her that the murder was not part of a game. He does tell Flynne that an assassination contract has been put out on Burton, on their timeline, using the darknet. Burton responds by getting his military colleagues to set up a perimeter around their house. Shortly after, his friend Conner, a triple amputee who uses a motorized, road-capable wheelchair, kills four armed men in a car heading up the country road to their house, using a mentally-controlled gun rig. Milagros Coldiron begins using their advanced technology and foreknowledge to build financial and political power in the past.

Wilf, Lev, and their allies in the further future are visited by Inspector Ainsley Lowbeer, investigating Aelita's disappearance. When they tell her what Flynne told them, she insists that Flynne be brought to the future via a peripheral (a cyborg avatar that users can connect to from another location) via the quantum server so that Flynne can identify the man who was present when Aelita died, to help solve the case. Lev and his assistants Ash and Ossian send back 3D printing instructions for a peripheral-controlling headset, which Flynne's computer-savvy friends Macon and Edward use to create a connectivity headband for her called ""the crown"". She connects to a peripheral that has been brought to Lev's house, where Wilf explains that this is really the future, albeit not one possible for her now that her timeline has been altered.

Lowbeer notices that Daedra is holding a new party at her sister's apartment, and she gets Wilf to get himself and Flynne's peripheral invited, with Wilf pretending that the peripheral will be controlled by a woman who studies neoprimitive art and is a huge fan of Daedra's work. Deciding they might need extra muscle to confront Daedra, Wilf's group recruits Conner to manufacture another crown and control another peripheral, a bodyguard for Wilf at the party; Conner is ecstatic at being able to walk again while piloting a peripheral. Meanwhile, back in the 21st century, a second group of assassins is killed by Burton's military colleagues. Milagros Coldiron attempts to ""buy"" the state governor, who, like most officials of the time, is corrupt, to avoid a police investigation. Burton's group use Milagros Coldiron's money and connections to build a secure base and acquire military equipment. Flynne is kidnapped by one of Burton's colleagues under blackmail by a local drug baron named Corbell Pickett. Pickett explains that the people who killed Aelita are operating a corporate collective called Matryoshka with the goal of killing Flynne, and Pickett is negotiating a higher reward before executing her. She is rescued by Burton and Conner, who kill Pickett’s security guards and destroy his compound. Wilf's crew in the future make her, Burton, and their friends executives of Coldiron USA, which is now battling economically and politically against Matryoshka around the globe, and declares their base the corporate headquarters.

Wilf reveals that the Jackpot begins in the middle of the 21st century as a combination of climate change and other causes, followed by a series of droughts, famines, pandemics, political chaos, and anarchy. 80% of the global human population dies off. But as this is going on, scientists have created nanotech called Assemblers that begins to rebuild society, as well as finding other scientific and engineering breakthroughs. As a result, everything is very efficient and advanced in Wilf's future, but it has mostly empty cities and most natural animal species are 
extinct
.

Wilf, Flynne and Conner (the latter two in their peripherals) go to Daedra's party, which has become a celebration of Aelita's life. Flynne spots the man who killed Aelita, but he and Daedra kidnap them, revealing themselves to be behind the plot to kill Flynne. Conner's peripheral is destroyed while trying to kill the kidnappers. The man who was present when Aelita was killed is revealed to be Hamed al-Habib, who had been ""killed"" by Daedra as a peripheral that day on the garbage patch, and had undergone surgery to revert himself to a more normal human form long ago. Daedra and Hamed have conspired with a city official named Sir Henry, who holds the position of 
remembrancer

Conner (operating a robotic weapon designed in another stub under Lowbeer's influence) and Burton (operating a peripheral-like exoskeleton) break into the room where Flynne and Wilf are being held. Flynne and Burton fire special weapons that direct Assembler nanobots, and both Hamed and Sir Henry are eaten down to the bone by the machines; Daedra is temporarily detained but is released after interrogation. In Flynne's world Matryoshka becomes completely inoperative and Milagros Coldiron gains uncontested power.

Years later, Flynne winds up married to the police officer she had long been interested in; her brother and their friends find love as well. Conner receives a set of bionic limbs constructed from plans sent from the future. Wilf finds love with his former coworker from Canada, with whom he moves in. He and Flynne still connect back and forth between timelines to see each other; Flynne meets weekly with Lowbeer (via peripheral) to discuss the changes to Flynne's world that are being made through the funding of Milagros Coldiron in an attempt to avert the Jackpot."

Selena and her older sister Julie, live with their parents in 
Manchester
, England. One day, when Julie is 17, she disappears without a trace. Several suspects are arrested, including an 
artisan
, Steven Jimson, but all are released for lack of evidence. 
Hatchmere lake
 and its surrounds, believed to have been visited by Julie, are searched, but yield nothing. Years of conflict over Julie's disappearance leads to the sisters' parents divorcing: their mother stops thinking about her, while their father, convinced Julie is alive, obsesses over her, and suffers a 
mental breakdown
 and dies.

Twenty years later, Selena, who now works for Vanja at a jewellery store, and has come to terms with her sister's disappearance, is surprised by a phone call from a woman claiming to be Julie and requesting a meeting. She agrees to see her, and, although initially skeptical, is convinced it is Julie when her sister reveals something from their childhood that no one else knew about. Julie tells Selena she has been back in Manchester for 18 months, but has told no one who she is. Selena is angry with her sister for having put their family through so much anguish, but Julie tells Selena what happened to her. She reveals that she travelled from Hatchmere lake, via a 
rift
, to a lake near the city of Fiby on the planet Tristane. Selena cannot believe how Julie could fabricate such lies to explain her absence. But as her sister expands on her story, Selena starts to wonder if such a thing could have happened. Julie explains that she was abducted by Jimson and taken to Hatchmere lake; she remembers escaping from him, then finding herself in a strange place and taken in by a woman named Cally and her brother, Noah. Julie learns from Cally where she is and that she has disappeared from this place before. Cally tells Julie that she was born on Tristane. Julie adjusts to her new life and finds out as much as she can about this new world. Years later, after a sexual encounter with Noah, Julie finds herself back in Manchester.

Selena does not know whether to believe Julie's story, and wonders if it is a 
fugue state
 brought on by her abduction. Selena takes Julie to see their mother, but she does not believe Julie is her missing daughter. Selena tells Vanja about Julie, and the two visit Hatchmere lake and attempt to retrace Julie's steps 20 years ago. Vanja finds what could be Julie's 
rucksack
 half buried in the bushes. They call the police, but make no mention of Julie's reappearance. The police later unearth a body and announce that DNA tests reveal a 98% certainty that the remains are Julie's. The sisters move into a house they bought and Selena introduces Julie to her mother as a friend, who still does not recognise Julie as her daughter."

Eighteen months after the events of “The Rosewater Insurrection”, the Nigerian government and Rosewater remain opposed. Femi Alaagomeji is released as part of a hostage exchange. In Nigeria, Femi, Eric, and Oyin Da work to end the Homian presence on Earth. Femi convinces Kaaro to join their cause.

Oyin Da once worked on a machine built with alien technology. The machine exploded, allowing her to see multiple possible futures. She eventually learns that the original Oyin Da was killed in the explosion; she now exists as a non-physical being, a pattern of thought remaining in the xenosphere.

In Rosewater, the Homians and humans share an uneasy existence. Koriko, the new name for the Alyssa/Wormwood avatar, continues to protect Rosewater from Nigeria and to transfer the consciousnesses of Homians into available human bodies. Homians begin murdering humans in order to take control of their corpses. Koriko endorses this tactic as a means to increase the Homian population.

Hannah Jacques, the wife of the mayor, sues the Rosewater government and alleges that the takeover of human bodies is a civil rights violation. Though she loses the case, it inspires anti-Homian sentiment. Nigeria uses criminal factions to try to destabilize Rosewater's government. Kaaro is killed by one of these groups. His ghost remains in the xenosphere.

Femi and Oyin Da create a virus designed to destroy the Homians on their data servers, committing genocide to save humanity. Kaaro's consciousness is uploaded to Home. He destroys all of the Homians and then self-destructs. Wormwood abandons Rosewater, which devolves into chaos. Jack Jacques is presumed dead. Aminat escapes to Nigeria. Femi is arrested, but the incoming president promises to pardon her. The novels ends with Femi and Oyin Da discussing art in Femi's prison cell."

A group of rebels attempting to overthrow both tyrants and win back their homeland.  Many of the rebels are natives of the province of Tigana, which was the province that most ably resisted Brandin; in a crucial battle, Brandin's son was killed. In retaliation for this, Brandin attacked Tigana and crushed it more savagely than any other part of the Palm; then he used his magic to remove the name and history of Tigana from the minds of the population.  Brandin named it Lower Corte, making Corte, their traditional enemies to their north, seem superior to a land that was all but forgotten.

Only those born in Tigana before the invasion can hear or speak its name, or remember it as it was; as far as everyone else is concerned, that area of the country has always been an insignificant part of a neighbouring province, hence the rebels are battling for the very soul of their country.

In the end the rebels engineer a battle between their two enemies hoping they will defeat each other.  After victory, the magic preventing others from remembering the province of Tigana is removed."

The plot involves 24th-century entrepreneur-tycoon-scientist Simeon Krug, who has created a race of 
androids
 to serve 
humanity
. Krug directs the construction of an immense tower of glass in the Canadian 
tundra
. The edifice is not a monument, however, but a way to communicate with a distant 
planetary nebula
, 
NGC 7293
, from which an intelligent (though indecipherable) message has been received. Krug is also building a 
starship
 to send there, which is to be crewed by androids in 
hibernation
.

The tower construction is directed by Krug's most faithful android, Alpha Thor Watchman. Thor and other leading androids have invented a secret religion for androids, based on the vision that their creator, Krug, intends to eventually make them equal to humans. Krug is unaware of the religion. Thor's dream is to convince him through indirect means, including the manipulation of his weak-willed son and heir, Manuel, through a sexual relationship with a female android, Alpha Lilith Meson. Thor eventually falls in love with her, as does Manuel.

After Thor and Lilith have manipulated Manuel into telling his father about the android religion, Krug insists that the minds of him and Thor be connected in the ""shunt room"" which allows one mind to probe another's
[

]
 (a form of 
technologically enabled telepathy
). Thor discovers via the link that Krug regards androids as mere things, and has no intention of treating them as equal to womb-born humans. Realizing that Krug will never give freedom to androids, Thor loses his faith and announces Krug's true nature to androids worldwide.  With the collapse of their religion, androids across all of Earth rebel.  Many walk off their jobs, others take control of key Earth installations, and some even kill humans in their long-suppressed rage. Thor then causes the fall of the nearly-complete, 1,200-metre-tall (3,900 ft) tower.

An enraged Krug attacks Thor; the latter, unable to fight his creator, is pushed into an unprogrammed 
teleporter
 and annihilated. Krug, his empire destroyed and humanity in grave danger, flees in his starship, alone, towards the star system from which the alien message was sent.

Charlie Johns wakes up in Ledom (model backwards), a world of 
gender-neutral
 people. He believes that he has been transported to the future, and the Ledom tell him that humanity has been destroyed by nuclear war.

He meets Seace, the head of the Science One, who explains the A-field, an invisible force field the Ledom use for everything from spoons to buildings. He meets Mielwis, the head of the Medical One, who explains to him how the Ledom came to be gender-neutral by a mutation. Mielwis tells him that the Ledom have both genital organs, which drop down when they are aroused and retract when they are not in use.

He meets Nasive and Grocid, the heads of the Children's Ones, who explain Ledom religion to him. The Ledom worship children because ""it is inconceivable we would ever obey one"".

Then Philos, a historian, leads him to the cerebrostyle, a technology that allows a viewer to watch recorded memories in their mind. Charlie reads a ""letter"" in this machine which is a manifesto of Ledom society. It tells how sexual differences have caused strife for humans and how Ledom society has achieved harmony by following a 
charitic
 religion and creating a gender-neutral culture.

After he has finished reading the letter, Philos takes Charlie out to the edges of Ledom, where he finds Philos's partner Froure and their child Soutin. Philos had let the Ledom think Froure and Soutin had died in a landslide because the Ledom, despite what Mielwis had told Charlie, did not mutate but undergo monthly medical procedures to keep them gender-neutral, and Philos does not want this to happen to Soutin. Philos asks Charlie if he will take Soutin back to his time period, and Charlie agrees.

They go back to the Science One and after a short confrontation with Seace, Charlie takes Soutin into the time machine. However, the time machine does not go anywhere and Charlie realizes he is stuck in Ledom. Mielwis asks him for his opinion about Ledom. Charlie says they are all freaks and if humanity knew they existed, humans would kill every one of them.

Mielwis knocks Charlie unconscious and confers with Nasive about how humanity is not yet ready for gender equality.

Charlie is allowed to live with Philos, Froure, and Soutin at the edge of Ledom. The book ends with nuclear bombs bursting in the sky, with the Ledom and Charlie being protected by the A-field."

Set in 2030–2031, ten years after the events of 
Software
, 
Wetware
 focuses on the attempt of an 
Edgar Allan Poe
-obsessed bopper named Berenice to populate Earth with a robot/human hybrid called a 
meatbop
. Toward this end, she implants an embryo in a human woman living on the Moon (Della Taze, Cobb Anderson's niece) and then frames her for murder to force her to return to Earth. After only a few days, she gives birth to a boy named Manchile, who has been genetically programmed to carry bopper software in his brain (and in his sperm), and to grow to maturity in a matter of weeks.

Berenice's plan is for Manchile to announce the formation of a new religion unifying boppers and humans, and then arrange to have himself assassinated. (Rucker makes several allusions to the 
Christ
 story; Taze's abbreviated pregnancy is discovered on Christmas Eve, for instance.) Before the assassination, Manchile impregnates several women, the idea being that his similarly accelerated offspring will create a race of meatbops at an exponential rate.

The plot goes disastrously awry, and a human corporation called ISDN retaliates against the boppers by infecting them with a genetically modified organism called chipmold. The artificial disease succeeds in killing off the boppers, but when it infects the boppers' outer coating, a kind of smart plastic known as flickercladding, it creates a new race of intelligent 
symbiotes
 known as 
moldies
 — thus fulfilling Berenice's dream of an organic/synthetic hybrid.

Both of the two main human characters of

Martin Seymour is an Australian news correspondent in 
Iran
 covering the 2012 Iranian parliamentary elections. The elections turn out to be a sham as many of the opposition candidates are banned, but Martin remains in Iran to cover the post election protests. Unrest escalates and the authorities are forced to hold free elections.

Nasim Golestani is an Iranian computer scientist living in exile in the United States following the execution of her father by 
VEVAK
,  the Iranian secret police. She works at 
MIT
 on the 
Human Connectome Project
 (HCP), which is attempting to produce a neural map of the human brain. She develops computer software that simulates 
zebra finch
 song production by using thousands of finch brain scans. But when Congress turns down funding for the project, Nasim returns to Iran to help rebuild her country.



Part 2: 2027–2028
[
edit
]


The story moves to a democratized Iran in 2027. Martin lives in 
Tehran
 with Mahnoosh, an Iranian political activist he married, and their six-year-old son, Javeed. Nasim heads a company in Tehran that has developed Zendegi-ye Behtar, an online multi-player 
virtual reality
 (VR) gaming platform. Zendegi uses 
cloud computing
 to run its operations across several countries. But Zendegi has to compete with several other VR providers, and Nasim looks for something new to add to Zendegi to give it an edge.

Nasim learns that HCP finally took off in the US and has published its first draft brain map based on thousands of brain scans of human 
organ donors
. She discovers that her contributions were not used by the project – HCP's goals were aimed at helping 
neurologists
 diagnose 
pathologies
, whereas her goal was to simulate the brain. Nasim decides to continue what she had started on HCP using the project's publicly available brain scans. Her goal is to improve the realism of Zendegi's proxies, computer-generated people that flesh-out the VR's landscape. She takes this a step further and starts taking 
MRI
 brain scans of living people. Nasim's first breakthrough comes with Virtual Azimi, a proxy she creates by scanning Ashkan Azimi, Iran's national 
football
 team captain, to record his 
motor skills
 while he replays games in his head. Virtual Azimi enables football fans to play games with Azimi's proxy, and it is a huge success, boosting Zendegi's popularity.

Javeed loves Zendegi and Martin often takes him to local gaming booths where together they participate in 
role-playing games
. One day Mahnoosh is killed in a car accident, and Martin has to raise Javeed on his own. Then Martin discovers he has terminal cancer, and concerned that Javeed will grow up without a father, he contacts Nasim and asks her to create a Virtual Martin that Javeed can communicate with in Zendegi. Nasim conducts MRI scans on Martin while prompting him with images and memories. But Zendegi comes under fire from religious fanatics. Iranian clerics denounce Virtual Azimi as ""an afront to God and human dignity"".

]
 It is also criticized by the Cis-Humanist League (CHL), a human rights group who object to enslaved proxies, saying that ""it's unethical to create conscious software that lacks the ability to control its own destiny"".

]


Nasim continues developing Virtual Martin in secret. While she knows that Virtual Azimi has no consciousnesses, she is not sure what Martin's proxy is turning into. Meanwhile, Martin's health is deteriorating and she sets up a VR session for him to evaluate the current state of his proxy. Martin enters Zendegi using Javeed's 
avatar
, making Virtual Martin think he is talking to his son, but the proxy overreacts to Javeed's (Martin's) behaviour and this upsets Martin. After Martin dies, Nasim has second thoughts about what she is doing. The Virtual Martin she has created  from fragments of Martin's brain is far from human. She realises that CHL are right: to upload a complete person into VR to achieve immortality is a noble goal, but ""to squeeze some abridged, mutilated person through the first available aperture [i]s not"".

By the 21st century, the 
Moon
 has been colonized, and although still very much a research establishment, it is visited by tourists who can afford the trip. One of its attractions is a  cruise across one of the 
lunar seas
, named the 
Sea of Thirst
, (located within the 
Sinus Roris
) filled with an extremely fine dust, a fine powder far drier than the contents of a terrestrial desert and which almost flows like water, instead of the common 
regolith
 which covers most of the lunar surface. A specially designed ""boat"" named the 
Selene
 skims over the surface of the dust in the same manner as a 
jetski
.

But on one cruise, a 
moonquake
 causes a cavern to collapse, upsetting the equilibrium. As the dust-cruiser 
Selene
 passes over, it sinks about 15 metres below the surface of the dust, hiding the vessel from view, and trapping it beneath the dust. Immediately there are potentially fatal problems for the crew and passengers inside. The sunken 
Selene
 has a limited air supply, there is no way for heat generated to escape, communications are impossible, and no one else is sure where 
Selene
 has been lost. As the 
Selene
 heats up and the air becomes unbreathable, young Captain Pat Harris and his chief stewardess Sue Wilkins try to keep the passengers occupied and psychologically stable while waiting to be rescued. They are helped by a retired space ship captain and explorer, Commodore Hansteen, who is initially traveling incognito.

Chief Engineer (Earthside) Robert Lawrence is sceptical that a rescue can be mounted, even if the 
Selene
 can be located. He is ready to abandon an initially unsuccessful search, when he is contacted by Thomas Lawson, a brilliant but eccentric 
astronomer
 who, from his vantage point on a 
satellite
 high above the Moon, 
Lagrange II
, believes he has detected the remains of a heat trail on the surface. An expedition is organised and Lawrence indeed makes contact with the 
Selene
. However the completely alien environment results in numerous unforeseen complications. The rescue mission decides to sink a tube supplying oxygen to the 
Selene
 first, in an effort to buy time to think of a way to get the passengers out. However, this becomes a race against the clock, as the heat in the 
Selene
 knocks out the chemical air purification system and the passengers are suffering from 
CO
2
 poisoning
. To preserve air, most passengers enter a chemically induced sleep, with only Pat Harris and physicist Duncan McKenzie staying awake. Just in time, the rescuers manage to drill a hole in the roof and deliver an air supply.

A plan is hatched to save the passengers of the 
Selene
 by sinking several concrete 
caissons
 to the roof of the ship and cutting a hole. When the first caisson is sunk, disaster strikes again: the liquid waste of the passengers had been expelled out of the ship, turning the dust around it into mud, which causes another, smaller, cave-in. The 
Selene
 sinks once more, this time only a small distance, but crucially, at a slope. The caissons cannot be connected to the roof which is now sloping at 30 degrees. The air supply and communications have also been damaged. After restoring these latter two, a new plan is made to sink the caissons, but now the bottom one has a flexible fitting attached to it which can be mounted to the sloping roof of the 
Selene
. The rescue mission works according to plan: the caissons are sunk, the dust is scooped out and the connection is made, but now time is running out again. When the air supply holes were drilled, 
Selene'
s double hull was breached and the space in between slowly filled with dust. The metal-rich dust reached the battery packs and short-circuited them. This causes the battery compartment in the stern to burn slowly. The resulting breach is barricaded by the passengers, but dust is still pouring in and there is a fear that the burning material will cause the 
liquid oxygen
 supply to explode. Meanwhile, Robert Lawrence is working in the rescue shaft: he sets a small 
ring charge
 to make a hole in the roof. Just in time, the hole is made and the passengers escape through the shaft. Captain Harris is the last to leave, up to his waist in dust. Just when he is clear of the shaft, the liquid oxygen explodes, destroying the 
Selene
.

A short 
epilogue
 sees Lawrence writing his 
memoirs
, Pat Harris and Sue Wilkins are married. Pat Harris is the captain of the 
Selene II
 on its maiden cruise which will also be the last cruise for Harris as he is hoping to transfer to the space service."

There are two interwoven themes in the novel. The first is the cost of justice. Destroying the race that attempted to destroy humanity (and, it is later revealed, other races) appears to be a simple matter of retaliation. The Killers, when they are discovered, have formidable 
philosophical defenses
 in addition to their vast technological resources. They have created hundreds of sapient races, interlocked in a culture of breathtaking complexity and beauty. The execution of justice falls to children of the destroyed planets. Those from Earth base their on-ship culture on 
Peter Pan

It is revealed once the Leviathan system is destroyed that the Killers were, in fact, still active within the system, continuing to manufacture fleets of self-replicating machines to destroy alien races. However, while the Killers were destroyed and justice served, trillions of what were likely innocents had to die to accomplish this. Bear leaves the human crew torn between relief that their work is complete and their guilt that they were little better than those they had come to destroy."

Six months after leaving Earth, Dee is seething with rage towards the people who ordered the nuclear strike that destroyed Earth. She knows they are aboard-ship, but the way that 
Atlas 2
 is set up, there is no way to contact anyone outside of one's immediate surroundings, nor even know who they are. Other than Dee, the only people who saw the detonation are her best friend, Carl; and Carl’s “sort-of lover,” Travis.

Dee tries to escape her trauma through an immersive game. An unexpected job offer by a designer who asks her help test his new game gives her access to the ship's computer, leading to her also being invited to play elite games. In the game world, she encounters a mysterious guide, who hints that they are there to help her. The game she finds herself in is different than any ""mersive"" she's played before, and she is shocked to learn that a man she killed inside the game has also died in the real world. When she discovered that the man is a member of an elite society also responsible for the destruction of earth, she realizes that she is on the path to discover the truth.

While Carl helps her investigate, her cagey guide performs seemingly impossible hacking feats to block him, while protecting Dee, and also inviting her to take her revenge on the destroyers of Earth.

As 
Atlas 2
 continues its 20-year journey towards the colony established by the first

Blackout
 is set several decades after the 
zombie apocalypse
, the Rising. Kellis-Amberlee is a normally beneficial virus that, on the death of any host mammal over 40 pounds (18 kg), ""goes live"" or ""amplifies"", and turns them into a 
zombie
. Most humans reside in controlled zones, and 
blogs
 are now the primary source of news and entertainment. The novel is written from the perspectives of Georgia and Shaun Mason, siblings and blogger-reporters. Over the preceding books, they, along with their colleagues at the After The End Times website, have uncovered a widespread conspiracy. The 
Centers for Disease Control
 (CDC), the agency responding to the zombie virus and responsible for public health and safety, is actually creating new 
substrains
 (culminating in a 
mosquito-transmitted variant
 released at the end of 
Deadline
), killing off those developing 
immune responses
 (including Georgia, who was assassinated during the events of 
Feed
), and frustrating research into a cure.

Shaun Mason, having discovered his immunity to the virus, is helping with Dr. Abbey's zombie research while hiding out from the CDC with the rest of the After the End Times team: Rebecca Atherton, Mahir Gowda, Maggie Garcia, and Alaric Kwong. Dr. Abbey tasks Shaun and Rebecca with travelling to zombie-infested Florida and recovering live mosquitoes for study, but when they head back to 
Berkeley, California
 to meet with Shaun's adoptive parents, they are lured into a trap and barely escape the CDC. Disheartened, Shaun and Rebecca head north to Seattle, where Maggie and Mahir have contacted the identity forger, the Monkey. He agrees to help them disappear with new identities if they help steal information from the Seattle CDC facility. The team, minus Maggie, breaks in and set up a remote-access 
Wi-Fi hotspot
, but their escape is hampered by a security alert.

After dying, Georgia awakens as a prisoner in a CDC facility and quickly concludes that she is a 
clone
. With the help of 
Epidemic Intelligence Service
 (EIS) undercover agents, Georgia learns she is a 97 percent match to the mind of the original Georgia and is intended as a ""showroom model"" for resurrection through cloning. She also discovers she is in Seattle, and other Georgia clones have been created, including a less mentally accurate but more compliant version for use against Shaun. The agents use a week-long sleep study as a cover to remove trackers and self-destruct devices implanted in Georgia's body, but a 
mole
 exposes the EIS team. Georgia escapes and takes the security alert as an opportunity to destroy the other clones.

Shaun, seeking an exit, runs into Georgia, fleeing her improvised explosives. They link up with Rebecca and Mahir, and escape to meet Maggie at the Agora luxury hotel. Although initially reluctant to accept Georgia's existence, her mannerisms and knowledge of Georgia's life, including an (only apparently incestuous) relationship between Georgia and Shaun, gradually convince the group that she is a real, accurate clone. They go to see the Monkey but are betrayed by one of his subordinates. A CDC squad attacks the location: the Monkey and his people are killed, and Maggie is wounded. She is left at the Agora for treatment, and the team heads back to Dr. Abbey's lab, where an EIS agent is waiting to transport them to Washington, D.C.. They are taken to the 
White House
 by Rick Cousins (former After the End Times journalist, now Vice President of the United States) to meet President Peter Ryman, who is being coerced to continue the conspiracy.

The CDC has found a cure for Kellis-Amberlee, but the cure destroys the 
immune system
 so instead, they have focused on engineering the virus to prevent natural immunities from developing, while taking measures to ensure they remain in power. While Shaun, Becks, and Alaric are briefed on (and secretly recording) the 
party line
 by a CDC scientist, Rick takes Georgia aside to explain the situation before they, with help from the EIS and the Secret Service, ""kidnap"" Ryman. The CDC initiates an outbreak inside the White House, during which Rebecca sacrifices herself to hold back the horde while the others escape. The survivors head to an EIS facility, where Shaun and Georgia help Ryman address the world, while Mahir orchestrates junior members of After the End Times to upload supporting evidence and blow the conspiracy wide open. As the world comes to terms with the revelations, the EIS takes over the CDC, while Georgia and Shaun head to the wilds of Canada to escape the limelight."

supernova
 in order to 
sterilize
 the stellar neighborhood. This was presumably done in order to protect the 
virtual reality
 machinery which now housed all of their planet's personalities. According to a theory of Thomas's, several worlds exist where the inhabitants uploaded themselves into machines instead of exploring the nature of the universe and gods.

Although the supernova explosion occurred over 400 years before the events of the novel, the radiation is first reaching 
Earth
 at the present time due to its distance from Earth. However, the alien ship's advanced 
telescope

 then sees a large black entity emerge from space itself and cover the exploding star.  This is final proof that a controlling intelligence is guiding and preserving some life-forms in the universe.

In the final chapter, the scientist, who is dying of

, travels to the entity on the alien ship, where a 
fusion
 of 
genetic
 materials from human and alien sources produces a new life form that the aliens conjecture will create the next cycles of the universe."

A diplomatic mission to the matriarchal planet New Amazonia reunites ex-lovers Vincent Katherinessen and Michelangelo Kusanagi-Jones after a separation of 17 years. Arriving in the capital city of Penthesilea, the men are ostensibly repatriating looted artwork, but in truth the ambassador-spies have been tasked with obtaining the Amazonians' secret energy technology by any means necessary, and doing what they can to facilitate a Coalition conquest. However, both Vincent (a master of observation) and Angelo (a trained liar and fighter) each have hidden plans to undermine their own mission. Meanwhile, multiple factions among the Amazonians are engaged in covert political intrigues rooted in the gender dynamics of their society.

Humanity now generally disregards spaceflight, and space exploration is in massive decline. Hutchins has retired from flying in space and now spends her days throwing fund-raisers in order to finance space exploration through private investors. The space program is on the edge of being terminated, when a physicist named Jon Silvestri announces that he has completed a much more efficient faster-than-light-speed engine, capable of reaching destinations in mere fractions of the time previously required, travelling much farther than Pluto in just under 8 seconds.

With this new drive, destinations such as the galactic core are mere months of travel away. Hutch and the characters in the novel use that engine to journey to the centre of the galaxy, while making stops at a few points of interest including Sigma 2711, a star system 14,000 light years away and the origin of mankind's only received signal from an alien race, a black hole with a mysterious artificial companion and the supposed home planet of a galaxy-wide surveillance system. But their true mission lies at the heart of the galaxy, the supposed origin of the mysterious Omega Clouds, mysterious clouds of energy that travel through space, attacking and destroying any structure with right angles, at regular 8000-year cycles.
As they near their final objective it becomes clear that the true purpose of the clouds is beyond anything any of them could have possibly imagined."

The first character introduced is a man called Paul Jonas, apparently an 
infantryman
 on the 
Western Front
 of the 
First World War
. In what he at first believes to be a dream or hallucination, he meets a woman with wings, who gives him a feather. He wakes from the experience to find himself back in the trenches, but realizes the experience was not a dream when he discovers the feather. Two of his comrades, Finch and Mullet, begin to express doubts about his sanity. Eventually, Paul runs off into no-man's land. There, he finds the bird-woman but Finch and Mullet have pursued him, and they have been transformed into monstrous shapes: Mullet is grossly fat and Finch has no eyes. Paul flees in terror and falls through a hole in space. He discovers himself in a place similar to the chess-land in 
Lewis Carroll
's 
Through the Looking-Glass
, where he is caught in the battle between the red and the white, as well as hunted by Finch and Mullet. He escapes with a young boy he met at an inn, whose name is Gally. They find themselves on Mars, which is inhabited by creatures who demand a sacrifice of a princess from the planet Venus each year. He recognizes the chosen woman as the winged woman he met earlier, but he cannot remember when he met her. His memory does not even extend to his time in the chess-land. With the help of other men from Earth, he rescues the princess, then flees from the angry Martians. He sees Mullet and Finch again, however, and tries to escape in a hijacked airship. He loses control of the airship and finds himself in a conservatory with a harp, which shrinks to the size of his palm. Mullet and Finch confront him, demanding that he give them the harp, but he refuses and appears again on the airship, which is hurtling toward the ground. Transported to yet another world, he is rescued from a frozen river by a group of 
Neanderthals
, and a voice comes from the harp, telling him that friends will search for him on the river.

The story moves to the late 21st century. The most significant technological change is the wide availability of 
virtual reality
 interfaces among all parts of society. The internet has been replaced by ""the Net,"" a vast network of online VR environments. In 
Durban
, a VR programming instructor named Irene ""Renie"" Sulaweyo is teaching a 
Kalahari San
 named !Xabbu how to create such environments, while providing for her family. Her family is made up by her alcoholic father Long Joseph and her ten-year-old brother Stephen. Stephen spends much of his time online and frequently joins his friends in escapades to forbidden areas of the net. When he somehow ends up in a coma after visiting a forbidden club, she and !Xabbu decide to investigate. Inside the club, they discover a number of very unsavoury entertainments, and are very nearly trapped by the managers. Their most bizarre and horrifying discovery is a very powerful hypnotic entity, which Renie nearly dies trying to escape from. Convinced that the club is set up to damage the minds of children, as it has done to Stephen, she resolves to stop the people responsible. She finds an unusual and large piece of code, in the form of a golden diamond, on her machine, and consults her friend and mentor, Dr. Susan van Bleeck, about it. As they examine it, it erupts into an image of a golden city, then disappears. Renie's difficulties multiply, as it becomes clear that her investigations have earned her powerful enemies: she is stood down from her job and unknown persons set fire to her family's apartment complex. Finally, van Bleeck is brutally assaulted and dies after leaving Renie and !Xabbu with three names: Martine Desroubins, Blue Dog Anchorite, and Bolivar Atasco. The first two are hackers that agree to help them find the golden city, which is in a mysterious network called ""Otherland"", while the third is an anthropologist and archaeologist whose expertise is pre-Columbian Latin America. Blue Dog Anchorite reveals himself to be Murat Sagar Singh, a retired programmer who worked on the security system for Otherland, and whose colleagues on the same project have been dying in unusual circumstances. He also reveals that Otherland was commissioned by a secret organisation called ""
The Grail Brotherhood
"", and that Atasco, who oversaw the security project for Otherland, was an important member of that organisation. Renie, !Xabbu, Martine, and Singh plan to break into Otherland; Renie and !Xabbu, along with Long Joseph and van Bleeck's assistant Jeremiah Dako, travel to Wasps' Nest, a mothballed military base in the 
Drakensberg
 mountains, where there is equipment allowing Renie and !Xabbu to stay connected to the Net for extended periods. Preparations completed, they hack into Otherland, but Singh is confronted and killed by the security system. He is later found dead in his room from a heart attack. Renie, !Xabbu, and Martine manage to enter Otherland and make their way to the golden city, which is called Temilún. There, they meet the God-King, who reveals himself to be Atasco.

In suburban California, a 
terminally-ill
 teenager named Orlando Gardiner has become the most celebrated warrior in Middle Country, an online 
VR
 
MMORPG
 based on swords-and-sorcery. However, while playing the game, he is distracted by a vision of a golden city and killed by a low-level monster. With the help of his friend, Sam Fredericks, he begins to investigate. Their investigations lead to TreeHouse, an online fringe community, and to Melchior, a code name used by Singh and others. Following the trail, they are mysteriously taken to a beach on a river. Across the river, they can see the golden city. They build a raft to cross the river, but are stopped by the police and taken to the palace of the God-King.

On an army base in 
North Carolina
, the young girl Christabel Sorensen becomes friends with Mr. Sellars, a mysterious old man living on the base. She is unaware that he is under house arrest, and her father, a senior military security officer, is in charge of guarding him. She helps him to escape from his house into a network of tunnels lying underneath the base.

The Grail Brotherhood emerges as a small number of the world's wealthiest and most powerful people who have formed an exclusive society. Otherland is their private network, where many of them own numerous simulation worlds (others being leased out for very large sums), and they intend to use it for even more mysterious purposes. They meet in a simulation based on ancient Egypt, where their leader, Felix Jongleur, appears as 
Osiris
 and obliges other members to present themselves as various 
Egyptian deities
. Jongleur commissions an employee, John Dread, to carry out a task referred to as the ""Sky God Project."" Dread promises to accomplish his mission, although it is not stated what exactly he must do.

Renie, !Xabbu, Martine, Orlando, Fredericks, and four other people in similar situations find themselves imprisoned in a virtual reality world so complex that it rivals reality. There, they meet Atasco and his wife, and learn that Atasco, though formerly a member of the Grail Brotherhood, has been uninvolved for some time (though he has been permitted to retain his simulation world), and is now secretly opposing the Brotherhood's plans. They meet the enigmatic Mr. Sellars, who tells them that the network is somehow built from the minds of catatonic children worldwide, and he calls upon the small group of adventurers to stop the Grail Brotherhood.

Before they can get their questions answered, however, the meeting descends into chaos. Unknown to any of those gathered, Dread and a team of expert assassins have attacked the Atascos' island home in Colombia, and Bolivar and his wife are suddenly murdered. Sellars gives the adventurers some brief instructions: they are to search along the river for Paul Jonas, who is at large within Otherland's many simulation worlds, then he too vanishes. Even as the adventurers flee Temilún, Dread, with the help of criminal hacker Dulcie Anwin, hijacks the simulation body of one of their party. The group sails down the river, hoping to find the answers that will enable them to free the children from Otherland's hold."

About 1,000,000 B.C., an unidentified alien race sent out robotic factories to many worlds in their part of the galaxy to prepare for future settlement. One of those factory ships suffers severe radiation damage from a near-miss by a 
supernova
 and goes off course, drifting in space for a hundred thousand years before landing on the Saturnian moon Titan. Due to a malfunction in its database, it begins producing imperfect copies that begin to 
evolve
 on their own. (The description of this background is presented in a prologue
[

 that proved sufficiently popular among readers that it was later anthologized on its own in a collection of Hogan's short fiction.)

]
 The resulting machine ecosystem eventually gives rise to humanoid robots with human-like intellects, who develop a civilization similar to early civilization of Earth. Almost all of them have reverence for their mythical creator, a being they call the ""Lifemaker"".

Early in the 21st century, the North Atlantic Space Organization (combining NASA and 
NATO
) dispatched the 
Orion
 with a cover story of 
terraforming
 
Mars
 for human habitation. Karl Zambendorf, a 
con artist
 who is present on this expedition to verify 
ESP
 over interplanetary distances, prematurely learns that the 
Orion
 and its crew of researchers is headed for Titan, where the discovery of the Taloids has been kept need-to-know on Earth.

When the 
Orion
 arrives, the first landing party sets down in a freethinking state where Thirg, a Taloid who was cast out of his home state Kroaxia, has fled. They are mistaken for the Lifemaker because they have come from the sky, which the Taloids cannot see out of due to Titan's atmosphere. But Thirg becomes more discerning as he and the humans begin to understand more of each other's speech. Thirg's brother Groork has come from Kroaxia to apprehend him, but Zambendorf intercepts him and sends him back to Kroaxia as a 
prophet
.

Zambendorf learned that NASO plans to exploit Titan's natural resources and use the Taloids to build the factories they need, reducing them to 
slaves
. The NASO business administrators on the 
Orion
 are already in agreement with the Kroaxian government to use human (the Taloids call humans ""Lumians"" because they glow brightly in their infrared vision) weapons to conquer Titan, believing the Kroaxian leadership buttressed by priests will be the easiest to control. Zambendorf, in his unanticipated role as Messenger for the Lifemaker, has given Groork guidelines akin to the 
Ten Commandments
 for his people to prevent a war from starting. ""All Taloids are brothers"" and ""No Taloid is to enslave or be a slave"" does not sit well with the ruling establishment of Kroaxia, and Groork is saved by the 
Orion
 crew not working for NASO. There will be use of Titan's resources, but the partnership between humans and Taloids will be one of equals.

The story is set approximately 9,000 years in the future (12th millennium AD), after humanity has expanded to inhabit countless worlds. Alex Benedict and his partner Chase Kolpath are antique dealers who run a firm called Rainbow Enterprises.

During the plot, several elements of the future history are disclosed, such as the global Dark Age and the loss of artifacts and records of that time, the 26th century interstellar colonization, and the 4th millennium unification of Planet Earth.

An intriguing artifact (a Corbett transmitter, which allows communications through hyperspace) that dates back to the Golden Age of Spaceflight is found in the home of deceased astroarcheologist Garnett Baylee. The source of the artifact is a mystery as Baylee never announced such a discovery.

While this is happening, the Capella, a cruise spaceship which disappeared over a decade ago, is expected to resurface from hyperspace, possibly leading to the evacuation of the spacecraft. This is significant because Benedict's uncle Gabe was on the Capella.

The events of 
Jade City
 take place a generation after the end of the Many Nations War, a conflict roughly analogous to 
World War II
, during which the One Mountain Society, a national liberation movement, successfully fought to end foreign occupation of Kekon. After the war, the One Mountain Society disintegrated into a number of rival clans, with the most powerful being the isolationist Mountain clan led by the Ayt family and the internationalist No Peak clan led by the Kaul family. The clans each have a Pillar, Horn, and Weather Man; the Pillar is the head of the clan, the Horn leads its street fighters, and the Weather Man is responsible for business activities.

Kekon contains the world's only supply of jade, a mineral that endows its wearer with enhanced abilities. Safe use of jade requires a combination of genetic predisposition and intense training in the six jade disciplines. The aboriginal population of Kekon, the Abukei, are completely immune to its effects, while individuals from outside Kekon are too sensitive to it. Only the Kekonese, with mixed aboriginal and settler ancestry, have the necessary combination of resistance and sensitivity to be able to use it long-term. Lee has commented that she tied jade ability to a combination of genetics and luck as ""a way to subvert that trope of the blood talent... the chosen ones.""

 Kekonese with no ability to use jade are called ""stone-eyes"" and are considered unlucky. The drug SN1, or shine, can be used to increase one's jade tolerance.



Jade City

Bero, a thief, attempts to steal jade from a No Peak Fist. He and his Abukei accomplice Sampa are quickly caught and brought to Kaul Hilo for punishment. Hilo takes the two boys to be questioned in the presence of his brother Lan, the clan Pillar. Hilo attempts to convince Lan that the Mountain clan is squeezing No Peak territory, but he is opposed by Doru the Weather Man, who counsels a peaceful solution. Feeling frustrated and unsupported by Doru, Lan asks his grandfather Kaul Sen for permission to replace Doru, but Kaul Sen refuses to allow it. Lan's sister Shae returns to Kekon from her studies abroad, but she declines to become involved in clan business and refuses to wear her jade.

The Mountain kidnaps Emery Anden, the adopted cousin of Kaul Lan, Hilo, and Shae. Ayt Mada offers Anden a position in her clan, signaling that she wishes to unite the Mountain and No Peak. Once Anden has been returned safely, Lan begins to move against the Mountain. He proposes a new law preventing any one clan from gaining control of the Kekon Jade Alliance, and he sends Shae to audit the KJA's accounts.

The Mountain makes an attempt on Hilo's life. Lan duels a Mountain clan member and is successful. In the aftermath, Hilo asks his brother for permission to marry his girlfriend Wen. Despite his misgivings about Hilo marrying a stone-eye from a disreputable family, Lan gives his permission.

Lan is injured in the duel, but he cannot show weakness by failing to wear the additional jade he has won. He arranges for Anden to bring him packages of shine. When Anden realizes what he is delivering, he pleads with Lan to stop using the drug. When Shae comes to see Anden, he fails to tell her about Lan's drug use.

Shae reports to Lan that someone in the KJA is skimming jade; either Doru doesn't know about it and is incompetent, or he is allowing it to happen. Lan sends Doru overseas to get him out of the way and tells his allies on the Royal Council that he is going to suspend jade production.

Meanwhile, the Mountain tells Bero to shoot up the gentleman's club that Lan frequents. Lan accidentally takes an overdose of shine while visiting the club, and when Bero attacks him he falls into the sea and drowns. When Shae hears about Lan's death, she decides to formally rejoin the clan and put on her jade. She persuades Hilo, the new Pillar, to strike back against the Mountain. Hilo appoints her as his Weather Man; Doru is arrested and placed under house arrest.

Shae and Hilo accuse Ayt Mada of skimming jade from the KJA and supplying it to foreign nations. Ayt arranges to meet Shae on safe ground and tries to talk her into betraying No Peak, but Shae refuses. Wen asks Shae to make her a spy for the clan without Hilo's knowledge. Shae sends her to a foreign military base with a shipment of jade worth millions, re-establishing the supply that has been disrupted by the KJA's suspension of jade production.

Doru defects to the Mountain. Hilo marries Wen, then has Anden drive him into Mountain territory, where he expects to be killed in combat. Together, Hilo and Anden manage to kill Gont Ascht, the Horn of the Mountain. The fight leaves Anden in a coma. When he regains consciousness, he learns that the loss of its Horn has dealt the Mountain a serious blow and given No Peak a temporary advantage in the war. Anden returns to the Academy for his graduation ceremony, but when he is presented with his jade he declares he does not want to be a Green Bone. He tells Hilo he does not want a life of violence, and the Pillar rebukes him publicly.

Later, under cover of darkness, Bero visits Lan's grave. He is still looking for jade, and in the former Pillar's coffin there is a generous supply.

The Confederacy, a massive space empire, duplicates the personality of its best agent and implants it into four brain-dead hosts. These hosts are sent to the four planets of a penal colony, the Warden Diamond, to investigate an alien threat and assassinate the four lords of the planets, the ""Four Lords of the Diamond."" The original agent is on a picket ship and downloads information from his copies.

A copy of the agent wakes up in the body of ""Cal Tremon,"" a criminal on a prison ship heading to Lilith. He must then adapt to Lilith, a beautiful tropical world where its Warden Organism, a symbiotic microorganism, destroys all non-Lilith material, making modernization very difficult. Thus, the several million inhabitants of Lilith's feudal society are serfs. The nobility of Lilith are the few who can control the organisms.

The agent thus finds himself a serf, with no hope of advancing unless he harnesses the power of the Warden Organisms. When a girl he liked was being taken away for experimentation, he taps into his Warden powers and kills the overseer, a petty tyrant.

While living in the Castle, the residence of the Duke, Cal gains some initial training and knowledge. He escapes when he learns that the nobles plan to kill him.  Outside of the castle walls, he gains a secure status in Lilith's society and no longer desires to serve the Confederacy.

Instead, he realizes that the Lord of Lilith, Marek Kreegan, a former Assassin of the Confederacy, cooperates with the aliens to preserve peace and order. Cal learns that Kreegan dissuaded the aliens from a genocide against humanity, choosing the slower course of subversion and sabotage instead.  Cal does not kill Kreegan.  His girlfriend, believing that Kreegan's death would will elevate Cal to Lordship, kills Kreegan by using a potion to draw on Cal's power.

In the near future, a race riot results in the destruction of an area just outside Los Angeles. The city sells the construction rights to a private company, who then construct an 
arcology
, named Todos Santos, to which control of the area and legal jurisdiction was 
ceded
. The higher standard of living enjoyed by Todos Santos residents causes resentment among Angelenos.  The arcology dwellers have evolved a different culture, sacrificing privacy – there are cameras (not routinely monitored) even in the private apartments – in exchange for security.  The residents are fiercely loyal to the arcology and its management, and the loyalty runs both ways.  During the course of the novel, Todos Santos is compared to a 
feudal society
, with loyalty and obligations running both ways, hence the title of the novel. The systems at the arcology are run by MILLIE, an advanced computer system, and some high-level executives have direct links to MILLIE via bio-electronic 
implants
 in their brains.
[

 Other workers in the arcology work by 
telepresence
, including one woman who remotely operates construction equipment on a 
lunar base
.

Todos Santos causes resentment among Angelenos, but has improved their lives as well.  The company that owns the arcology tows icebergs in, solving the water shortage for all Southern Californians. Todos Santos has dug a Los Angeles subway using a digging machine, which uses an 
oxyhydrogen
 torch. Todos Santos is at the hub of the subway system, and contains a huge mall, which Angelenos may visit.  This easy access causes Los Angeles' city officials to complain about the shopping dollars and tax revenues going outside the city limits.

As the story opens, three young Angelenos sneak into the maintenance areas of Todos Santos.  When they are detected by Todos Santos' security systems and personnel, they give every appearance of being terrorists, including spoofing the correct electronic access codes.  When non-lethal means of stopping the three fail, Deputy Manager Preston Sanders orders lethal gas released rather than risk the disastrous consequences of a bomb going off.  Two of the intruders are killed.  They turn out to be youths, with high tech equipment and boxes with such labels as ""bomb"", but without the actual means of harming the arcology.  It soon turns out that they were duped by the ""Friends of Man and the Earth Society"" (FROMATES), anti-technology zealots who want to see Todos Santos destroyed or abandoned, as a means of forcing the arcology to turn off its lethal defenses for a later real attack.

The deaths of the two youths cause political problems.  Sanders is charged with murder.  While arcology manager Art Bonner is quite prepared to defy the city authorities, Sanders turns himself in.  The arcology is forced to turn off its lethal defenses as the FROMATES planned.  When that happens, they soon face a full-fledged attack by the FROMATES, which they deter by non-lethal means, until the intruders prove they have deadly weapons, at which point Todos Santos security responds in kind, shooting and killing most of the intruders.  While city authorities are still reacting to this, the arcology launches a jailbreak, the idea of chief engineer (and resident genius) Tony Rand. They tunnel under the jail using the tunneling machine that the ""Saints"" used to build the L.A. subway, release sleep gas into the jail, and free Sanders.

Los Angeles soon retaliates with arrest and search warrants, but they are soon defeated by the sheer size of the arcology and the ability of the Todos Santos executives, aided in part by their direct links to MILLIE, to hide Rand and Sanders.  After Todos Santos shows that it can cause Los Angeles trouble, such as by contaminating the Los Angeles water supply with salt water, and by work stoppages among the telepresence operators, a truce is arrived at: Rand and Sanders will leave the country permanently, and relations between Los Angeles and Todos Santos will be restored. In effect, Todos Santos has won, if only by restoring the 
status quo ante

On the Steel Breeze
 is set in the 
24th century
, 200 years after the events of 
Blue Remembered Earth
. It depicts a massive 
interstellar colonization
 effort, involving hundreds of immense 
generation ships
 known as ""holoships"" carrying millions of humans to 
extrasolar planets
. The holoships are propelled to 
relativistic
 velocities by engines based on exotic ""Chibesa physics"", but are in danger of overshooting their target planets due to a lack of fuel for deceleration. Meanwhile, the ocean-dwelling 
transhumans
 of the United Aquatic Nations have become one of Earth's pre-eminent powers, and the colonization of 
Venus
 is underway.

The novel's main characters are two clones of Chiku Akinya, the daughter of one of the main characters of 
Blue Remembered Earth
. The original Chiku had herself cloned centuries before to allow her to experience three different lifestyles. One clone, Chiku Yellow, remained on Earth, while the second, Chiku Green, embarked on a holoship heading for the alien planet of Crucible, which is home to a mysterious structure known as the Mandala. A third clone, Chiku Red, was lost attempting to find her famous great-grandmother Eunice Akinya in deep space. Chiku Green faces a series of revelations after a strange accident kills hundreds aboard her holoship, while Chiku Yellow is haunted by a cybernetic ""ghost"", leading her to seek out a powerful transhuman on Venus."

Ahmed Bazargan (an 
Iranian
) leads the team of diplomats who descend to the planet World. On his team are Dieter Gruber, a 
geologist
; Ann Sikorski, a 
xenobiologist
; and David Campbell Allen III, a 
graduate student
 in xenology. Their mission is to learn as much as possible about World, the Worlders and their culture, particularly the peculiar phenomenon of shared reality, which causes ""head-pain"" to those holding, or in the presence of someone holding, views contrary to the majority. This has had the drawback of limiting science, technology and progress; Worlders, though a far older 
species
 than Terrans, are somewhere around the 
Renaissance
 in terms of its technology. Bicycles are the cutting edge in personal transportation, each produced by 
artisans
 and individual 
craftsmen
. On the other hand, there has never been a war on World; even the average barroom brawl causes intense head-pain. World's religion focuses on flowers; they believe that their people were created by the First Flower, which descended into the Neury Mountains, and much of their ceremony, both religious and every-day, involves blossoms. The sacredness of the mountains themselves is maintained by a 
wasting sickness
 inflicted on any who enter it.

The Terran contingent was delivered by the 
Zeus
, a warship in the rather piecemeal Solar Alliance Defense Network.  The diplomatic mission is merely a cover story for the military objective, which is headed by 
Colonel
 Dr. Syree Johnson (ret.), a soldier and military 
physicist
. The true objective involves ""Orbital Object #7"", one of World's seven 
moons
 (known as ""Tas"" by the locals). It is in very low orbit, is clearly artificial, and was created by the same unknown 
progenitor
 race that created the space tunnels. Johnson's mission is to analyze Orbital Object #7, decipher its use, and discover if it can be used as a weapon. Whether it can or not, it is about nine times too large to fit through the tunnel, and Johnson and her team can think of no way to safely disassemble it.

Orbital Object #7 has fourteen bumps on the outside, each labeled with a number of their own dots: one, two, three, five, seven, eleven, and thirteen. The ancient builders' love for 
prime numbers
 is well-known; the space tunnels are marked with primes as well. It is theorized that the bumps are activating studs, and manipulating both bumps of one integer (they are on opposite sides, to avoid accidental activation by, say, a passing 
meteor
) will trigger the artifact. When Orbital Object #7 is tested on setting one, it sends out a spherical wave that causes all nearby material higher than 
atomic number
 75 (
rhenium
) to go 
radioactive
—not by irradiating them with energy, but by manipulating the heretofore-untouchable 
strong nuclear force
. Johnson and her team are still deciding what to do when a Faller scout craft (a ""skeeter"") emerges from Space Tunnel 438. The 
Zeus
 attempts to engage using 
particle beam weaponry
, specifically a directed 
proton
 weapon, and are shocked when the beam passes through it instead of destroying it. (This has nothing to do with the strength of the weapon; proton beams utilize particles accelerated to a high percentage of the 
speed of light
. Were the skeeter to land a shot on the 
Zeus
, she would be destroyed as thoroughly as if vice versa. The advantage of a larger ship like the 
Zeus
 is in higher-ranged weaponry: it attacks the skeeter hours before the Faller can counterattack.) Johnson comes up with a theory that the proton beam is subject to the 
Heisenberg
 
uncertainty principle
, and is simultaneously composed of waves and particles until it is ""observed"" by someone - specifically the ship it shoots - at which point it resolves into a stream of particles and destroys whatever has just observed it. Evidently, the Fallers have discovered a way to alter the beam's ""phase complex"" to prevent the beam from resolving; essentially, the skeeter chooses not to ""observe"" the proton beam and is thus unaffected by it. The skeeter, having thus proven that ignorance is bliss, performs a close fly-by of Orbital Object #7 and then departs.

On World, Bazargan struggles particularly with David Allen, who is entranced by the forced 
altruism
 of shared reality and wishes to splice it into the human genome. He also liaises with the head of a rich trading family, Hadjil Pek Voratur, who sees plenty of chances for 
profit
 in the Terrans' advanced technology. He and his team, especially Pek Sikorski, are generally attended by Enli Pek Brimmidin, a household servant who picks up English with surprising speed. Enli, a 
point-of-view
 character, is a spy in the employ of the ""Reality and Atonement"" branch of World's government; her task is to gather information that will shed light on the question of whether Terrans are ""real""—that is, subject to shared reality. This is not an idle concern: those few Worlders who are born without the ability or cannot socialize to it are quietly euthanized. Enli herself has been declared unreal, having murdered her brother, and has been assigned this task as atonement. Bazargan and Ann Sikorski eventually strike a bargain with Voratur, trading the secrets of 
antihistamines
 (for Worlders, 
flower-sickness
 is sacrilegious) for a chance to perform a ""Lagerfeld"" 
brain scan
 on him. They agree only after Voratur takes a dose of antihistamine himself (having commissioned Enli to steal it) and survives.  One of the Worlders testing the first batch of home-made drug dies from it. The Lagerfeld scan is unable to pinpoint a specific place in the Worlder brain where shared reality nests, and Ann concludes that it did not evolve and is not genetic; David Allen refuses to believe this, and begins to suspect a conspiracy between Bazargan and the high priests of World.

Aboard the 
Zeus
, Johnson and the other crew make the decision to push Orbital Object #7 out of orbit and towards Space Tunnel 438, in the hopes of breakthroughs during the five-day journey. She informs Bazargan of the action, including that, if necessary, they will destroy the artifact, possibly creating a destabilizing wave that could affect World. Bazargan goes to inform Voratur of this, only to have Voratur discover that Bazargan did not know that his mission was a cover story. This is binding proof: Terrans do not share reality. Their lives thus endangered, the Terrans, along with Enli, flee to the Neury Mountains, where no one will (or can) follow them. They are protected by environmental suits from the radiation, but they are still subject to a bizarre phenomenon: a slowing-down of the brain, a neurological phenomenon that only Enli remains unaffected by. Deep in the mountains, Gruber discovers a second alien artifact, similar to the one found in space but much smaller (perhaps 25 meters in diameter). It appears to have crash-landed on the planet millions of years ago (precipitating a 
mass extinction
) and is putting out prodigious amounts of 
radiation
. However, the radiation field is in the shape of a 
torus
 (a 
doughnut
), and when the team moves into the ""hole"" of the field, Enli is not afflicted with the head-pains normally associated with unshared reality. Gruber theorizes that the field they passed through alters 
probability
; this allows it to have an effect on human 
brain tissue
 because the release of 
neurotransmitters
 is a quantum-level event and thus susceptible to probability (indeed, 
nerve cells
 do not always release neurotransmitters, even when stimulated with exactly the same amount of voltage).

Speeding towards Space Tunnel 438, the 
Zeus
 is confronted by a Faller cruiser, and detaches from the artifact, which continues on at over 4,000 kilometers per second.  The engagement is largely inconclusive until Orbital Object #7 actually enters the tunnel. Just prior to this, Dr. Johnson receives a transmission from the diplomatic team containing Gruber's theories on the probability field, and realizes that this could explain the Fallers' new shield. However, her speculation is short-lived; when Orbital Object #7 enters the tunnel and is subsequently destroyed by it, it fires off a destabilizing wave at its maximum setting (revealed in the sequel 
Probability Sun
 to have a range of about 6 billion kilometers, and to somehow be not susceptible to the 
inverse square law
), which destroys the 
Zeus
 as well as all Faller craft, irradiates an outer planet in the World system, and then proceeds onward to World itself.

David Allen abducts Enli and drags her out of the mountains, passing through sections of high radiation to do so. Enli, wearing one of the team's four e-suits, is protected, but David takes thousands of 
rads
. (Back with the team, Ann speculates that David is suffering from 
grandiose
 
paranoid schizophrenia
). The two then descend back down to civilization, where they proclaim to be real and explain that a ""sky sickness"" is coming. David teaches Worlders the proper techniques to shelter against radiation, and, having proclaimed his reality by dying for the sake of others, convinces the Worlders that Terrans 
do
 share reality. Meanwhile, Bazargan, Dieter and Ann receive the final transmission from the 
Zeus
 (having traveled 54 light-minutes to reach them), only to discover that Dieter's artifact reacted to the destruction of Orbital Object #7 
when it was destroyed
, once again implying macro-level entanglement. World is ultimately unaffected by the destabilizing wave, for reasons that are not revealed until the sequel. Armed with new hypotheses, the team is retrieved by Terran forces a few days later."

Nigerian agent Kaaro uses his psychic powers to investigate a mysterious alien dome and deaths linked to it. 

In 2012, an alien named Wormwood appears in London, substantially altering the world's geopolitical landscape. In the 2050s, it creates an impenetrable dome in Rosewater, Nigeria. It exudes a fungus called xenoforms, which interact with human nervous systems. A very small number of humans are able to use the xenoforms to access an information network known as the xenosphere; these humans are called “sensitives”. The life of Kaaro, a sensitive, is presented throughout different decades.

As a teen, Kaaro uses his burgeoning psychic abilities for thievery. He is caught and almost executed. He escapes and begins using his telepathy on the black market before being recruited by the government. In the 2050s, he trains with S45, a secret branch of the Nigerian government. He is tasked with tracking down Oyin Da, an anarchist revolutionary. Kaaro and Da travel to the future site of Rosewater, where they speak with Wormwood. They are followed by S45 agents who shoot at Wormwood, but Kaaro senses the trap and saves him. Wormwood then creates the dome to separate himself from most humans; Da stays within the dome and Kaaro does not.

In 2066, Kaaro is still working for S45. Sensitives begin dying of an unknown illness. He begins seeing a mysterious woman named Molara in the xenosphere. He dates a woman named Aminat. Unbeknownst to Kaaro, she is an undercover S45 agent. Molara reveals that she is of alien origin; she is the embodiment of the xenosphere. The creation of sensitives was an unintended consequence as aliens gathered information about Earth. They no longer need more information, so they are killing the sensitives. She attempts to kill Kaaro, but he is rescued by Wormwood. Kaaro learns that the aliens are replacing human DNA with their own over the course of generations. He and Aminat continue their lives, unsure about how to combat the inevitable end of humanity."

A young Chinese-American girl, whose parents run a laundry in a magical Los Angeles, resolves to become a movie star. Achieving stardom, in this Hollywood, involves a literal 
apotheosis
 that grants immortality. After a series of bit parts for the director Jacko Dewalt, she blackmails him to meet the studio executive Oberlin Wolfe. To avoid revealing her real name (and thus making herself magically vulnerable), she takes her sister's name, Luli. 

Luli joins Wolfe's 
studio system
, on the condition that her roles will include ""no maids, no funny talking, no fainting flowers."" These conditions limit her career. She befriends her roommate in the studio dorms, a kidnapped 
Skogsrå
 named Greta. She also begins a romance with the more-established actress Emmaline Sauvignon. Greta falls in love with Wolfe's protégé Brandt Hiller, whom Wolfe intends to sacrifice in that year's ritualistic 
Wild Hunt
, through which Wolfe feeds a dangerous ancient power. Eventually, Luli lands a major role as a 
siren
. She befriends her famous co-star Harry Long, who reveals to her his secret relationship with a man. Luli's siren movie is a hit, as is its sequel. Greta (now pregnant) and Luli rescue Brandt during the Wild Hunt, and he and Greta escape to Sweden. Emmaline rejects Luli, angry that she drew Wolfe's negative attention. 

Two years later, Luli's initial contract with Wolfe is nearly over. While filming the third siren movie, the set catches fire and Harry disappears; he is declared dead. Luli connects with the 
butch
 Tara Lubowski at a lesbian bar. Jacko is brought on to direct a hasty re-envisioning of the siren film without Harry in the lead. As Jacko's revenge on Luli for her long-ago blackmail, the film now ends with the siren begging pathetically for her life. Luli is initially angry that Tara (under a male pseudonym) has written this degrading ending, but after she and Tara get to know each other better, they begin a romance. Filming the climactic death scene of her siren, Luli achieves magical stardom. She re-signs with Wolfe from a position of power.

The epilogue is narrated from Luli's perspective as a celestial star in the present day, reflecting on the legacy of her long career and her romantic relationships."

 She claims she had been trapped in a parallel reality populated by 
fairies
. Tara believes she was missing for only six months, yet her family knows she has been gone for 20 years. During her absence Tara has barely aged at all, still resembling a 15-year-old girl.

 Tara's family refuses to accept her explanation for her disappearance. Nevertheless, Tara insists it is true. The family employs Dr. Underwood to assess Tara's sanity. The psychiatrist concludes she has unconsciously fabricated her story as a defense mechanism to avoid confronting some trauma that must have occurred during the period of her absence.

Tara becomes increasingly dissatisfied with life with her parents and boyfriend, finding it pales in comparison to her supposed experiences in the parallel world. Her neighbor, Mrs. Larwood, claims to have had the same experience, and warns her of the dangers involved in moving between the two worlds.

Richie is attacked twice by an unknown assailant, and is later stricken with brain cancer. Tara believes that this is the work of Hiero, who followed her back to the human world and threatened to ""blast"" Richie's mind. At the novel's conclusion Tara once again disappears, leaving a note for Richie indicating that her departure was voluntary, and done in an effort to protect him from Hiero's revenge.

The main character, ten-year-old Hubert Anvil, is a chorister at St George's Basilica, Coverley (real world 
Cowley
), for whom tragedy beckons when his teachers and the 
Church
 hierarchy, all the way up to the 
Pope
 himself, decree that the boy's superb voice is too precious to sacrifice to 
puberty
. Despite his own misgivings, he must undergo 
castration
, one of the two 
alterations
 of the title. Insight into this world is offered during Anvil's abortive escape from church authorities, with references to alternative world versions of known political and cultural figures. Hubert's mother carries on an illicit affair with the family chaplain, and his brother, Anthony, is a 
liberal
 dissident from repressive church policies.

In this timeline, there are two pivotal divergences from known history. 
Arthur Tudor
 and 
Catherine of Aragon
's short-lived union produced a son, Stephen II of England. When 
Henry of York
 (""the Abominable"") tried to usurp his nephew's throne, there was a papal 
crusade
 (the ""War of the English Succession"") to restore the rightful heir, culminating in the ""Holy Victory"" at Coverley, which was designated as the ecclesiastical capital of England.

Secondly, the Protestant Reformation did not take place as 
Martin Luther
 was reconciled to the Roman Catholic Church and later became 
Pope Germanian I
. Luther's 
anti-Semitism
 may have infected this history to a greater extent during his papacy,
[
citation needed
]
 as the novel discloses that 
Jews
 are forced to seclude themselves and wear 
yellow stars
 to advertise their religious and ethnic identity. In this history, 
Thomas More
 did not marry, and ascended to the Papacy as 
Pope Hadrian VII
.

While the Papacy still holds sway across 
Western Europe
, in this version of the twentieth century Protestantism is limited to the breakaway Republic of 
New England
, which includes such locations as Cranmeria (named after 
Thomas Cranmer
), Hussville (named for 
Jan Huss
), Waldensia (
Waldensians
) and Wyclif City (
John Wycliffe
). The head of the 
schismatic
 church in New England is the 
Archpresbyter
 of Arnoldstown (named after 
Benedict Arnold
). 
Joseph Rudyard Kipling
 held office as ""First Citizen"" from 1914 to 1918, while 
Edgar Allan Poe
 was an acclaimed general who died at the moment of his victory over the combined forces of 
Louisiana
 and 
Mexico
 in the war of 1848–1850. We learn towards the end of the book that this Protestant state also has unpleasant features, such as practising 
apartheid
 towards 
Native Americans
 and a harsh penal system.

England dominates the British Isles with 
Ireland
 being called ""West-England"" and 
Scotland
 being annexed to England as ""North-England"". Instead of 
parliamentary democracy
, the English Isles are administered by a 
Convocation
 of clergy accountable to the Catholic hierarchy. The rule of the Church is absolute and totalitarian, controlled by the Holy Office, a sort of 
KGB
 or 
Gestapo
 equivalent. (Monsignors Henricus and Laurentius – 
Heinrich Himmler
 and 
Lavrentiy Beria
 – are mentioned in passing.)

The state of the world is illustrated in a description of national, clerical and royal figures at the funeral of Stephen III, late King of England, which opens the book. There is reference to the Kings of 
Portugal
, 
Sweden
, 
Naples
 and 
Lithuania
, which suggests that no Italian nation-state exists in this history due to the temporal strength of the Papacy. The Crown Prince of 
Muscovy
 is also mentioned, suggesting that Tsarism holds sway, and the 
Dauphin
 leads one to conclude that the French monarchy is also still in existence. 
Germany
 is a nation-state, known as Almaigne and ruled by an Emperor, although it may not have exactly the same national boundaries. The ""Vicar General"" of the ""Emperor Patriarch"" of Candia  suggests that the 
Greek Orthodox Church
 survives as a separate ecclesiastical jurisdiction, albeit exiled from its native 
Greece
 (which is still under 
Ottoman domination
) and with its headquarters in 
Crete
. Finally, this opening section cites the ""Viceroys"" of India, 
Brazil
 and 
New Spain
, suggesting that 
colonialism
 and direct 
imperialism
 are still realities here.

A Christian/
Muslim
 
cold war
 exists between the Papacy and the Ottoman Empire. Described as a war against an opponent that can never be destroyed and which can be held in check only by maintaining permanent armies and fleets, it serves the useful purpose of distracting any tendency to rebel or question. 
Pope John XXIV
 is a 
Machiavellian
 Yorkshireman, who allows the cold war to heat up as a 
Malthusian
 plot to resolve Europe's 
population growth
 – the church has access to 
bacteriological warfare
 as an alternative to 
birth control
, whose prior papal prohibition John XXIV opposes. The book's coda, set in 1991, fifteen years after the events of the main body of the book, reveals that events have turned out as the Pope planned. Europe's surplus population has become cannon fodder for the war, which ended in a narrow victory although the 
Ottoman Empire
 got as far as 
Brussels
. However, one of Hubert's childhood friends, Decuman, is mentioned as being among the occupation troops in 
Adrianople
 in far western 
Turkey
, suggesting that the Ottomans either lost the war, or at least were forced to make significant territorial concessions to the Catholic West.

William Shakespeare
's work was suppressed in this history, although 
Thomas Kyd
's original text of 
Hamlet
 has survived, and is still performed in 1976 (albeit only in New England). 
Shelley
 lived until 1853, at which point he set fire to 
Castel Gandolfo
 outside 
Rome
 and perished. By contrast, 
Mozart
, 
Beethoven
, 
Blake
, 
Hockney
 and 
Holman Hunt
 have allowed their talents to submit to religious authority. Edward Bradford argues that the choice of authors and musicians here is not meant to imply Amis's own preferences, but questions the value of art subordinated to a destructive ideology that represses 
sexual freedom
 and human choice.

 Underscoring the clerical domination of this world, Hubert's small collection of books includes a set of Father Bond novels (an amalgam of 
Father Brown
 and 
James Bond
), as well as 
Lord of the Chalices
 (
The Lord of the Rings
), 
Saint Lemuel's Travels
 (
Gulliver's Travels
), and 
The Wind in the Cloisters
 (
The Wind in the Willows
). There is also reference to a Monsignor 
Jean-Paul Sartre
 of the 
Jesuits
, and 
A. J. Ayer
 (who was in real life a noted atheist) is Professor of Dogmatic Theology at 
New College, Oxford
.

""Science"" is literally a dirty word, and while ""invention"" is not, the scope of inventors is severely limited. Electricity has been banned; the only form of 
internal combustion engine
 permitted is the 
Diesel
, which works without a 
spark
. Some of the incidental pleasure of the book is in the ""alternative technology"" reminiscent of Amis's friend and fellow-author 
Harry Harrison
, such as the 
high-speed train
 that takes characters from 
London
 to Rome in just seven hours, via 
Thomas Sopwith
's Channel Bridge. 
Airships
 feature as a mode of transportation connecting Europe with Africa and North America, with heavier-than-air vehicles being exclusive to New England.

Allusion to known historical figures include the political scene in Britain in the 1970s, and may reflect Amis's increasingly conservative attitudes.

Lillian Kagwa and Brian West meet in 
New York City
 in 1968. In September 1977, they have a son, Apollo. By the time Apollo is 4, Brian has disappeared. In 1989, 12 year old Apollo receives a cardboard box labeled “Improbabilia” which contains mementos from his father’s life as well as a copy of 
Outside Over There
 from Apollo’s childhood. This incident inspires him to become a rare book dealer.

Apollo falls in love with a librarian named Emma Valentine. They eventually marry and have a son named Brian. Emma begins having disturbing thoughts that Brian is not really her son and has been replaced by a 
changeling
. Emma and Apollo fight. Apollo contemplates leaving with his son, but falls asleep. He awakens to find himself chained to the radiator. Emma breaks his jaw with a hammer and kills Brian before disappearing. A grief-stricken Apollo holds several of Emma’s coworkers hostage, demanding to know where she has gone. Apollo is convicted and spends two months incarcerated at 
Rikers Island
.

Apollo and his business partner Patrice sell a rare book to William Wheeler. Wheeler tells Apollo that he knows Emma’s whereabouts. Together, they go to 
North Brother Island
. Apollo is captured by a group of women and brought to Callisto, or “Cal”, their leader. All of these women have similar stories; they all killed a child that they believed was replaced with a changeling. Wheeler attacks the compound. Cal tells Apollo to visit Brian’s grave, and that Emma is searching for Brian in the forest. She stays behind as Apollo and the rest of the compound members flee.

Apollo and Patrice dig up Brian’s grave. Instead of a corpse they find a creature composed of hair, bones, and teeth. Apollo goes to 
Forest Hills, Queens
 in search of Emma. He encounters a Norwegian man named Jorgen. Jorgen tells Apollo about the 
Restauration
, an 1801 sloop that brought a group of Norwegian immigrants to the USA. Jorgen's ancestor Nils brought a 
troll
 with him from Norway in order to ensure safe passage for his ship. In exchange, Nils and his descendants, including Jorgen, began kidnapping children and giving them to the troll, a cycle that has been ongoing for centuries. William Wheeler is Jorgen’s son. Apollo kills Jorgen.

Apollo finds Emma in the woods. They return to Jorgen’s house, and Apollo calls Lillian, who reveals that Apollo's father Brian attempted to kill Apollo after she served him with divorce papers, so she killed him to defend her son. Apollo and Emma then  find Jorgen's son Wheeler in the basement. He has been streaming a dark web video feed of their son, in which viewers pay for access and wait for Brian to be eaten by the troll. Emma kills Wheeler. They burn the house down and escape through a tunnel in the basement and find the troll’s cave. They attempt to rescue Brian, but the troll eats him. Apollo cuts Brian from the troll’s stomach, and the troll turns to stone as the sun rises. Apollo and Emma return home with their rescued son."

Like many of Pohl's novels, this opens in a world reduced by a crisis, in this case the loss of 
fossil fuels
.  
Solar power
 is a major, albeit insufficient, source of power.  Electricity is metered and cut off if a home exceeds a maximum amount of usage.  ""Power piggery"", the profligate use of electricity, is a crime.

The Rev. H. Hornswell ""Horny"" Hake becomes embroiled in ""the Cool War"", in which each country tries to sabotage the economies of its rivals, even if politically they are allies.  For instance, he is put in charge of a party of schoolchildren touring Europe.  The children are, however, carrying a virulent flu-like disease that affects only adults aged between 30 and 50, the ""prime of life"" individuals who tend to run businesses and government in industrialized countries.  As a result, industrial production in Europe falls drastically.  The group who created the infection is known only as ""The Team"" and is composed of former agents of the CIA and other organizations.

However the War has produced a group of people who profit by its continuation and can suppress technologies that might solve humanity's problems.  In particular a new form of solar energy collection relies on bio-engineered ""sunflowers"" which, while technically plants, have extremely reflective petals and can be trained to focus light from a wide area on a furnace or power generator.

The first ship that Humanity sent into interstellar space was the 
Southern Cross
, sent on a four-and-a-half century voyage to 
Alpha Crucis
. On autopilot she accelerated at over one hundred gees until she was flying away from Sol at half the speed of light. Then the autopilot shut down the ion drive, the ship went into free fall, and the first crew went into the mattercaster on Earth's moon to be teleported aboard the ship for their month-long tour of duty. Ten generations later, when she is one hundred light years from Sol, Southern Cross receives her last crew, though the four men who come through the mattercaster do not know that they 
are
 the last crew.

Terangi Maclaren, an astrophysicist of Polynesian ancestry, has convinced officials of the Protectorate, the dictatorship under which he lives, to take a great risk. Previous crews have made observations indicating that 
Southern Cross
 will pass close enough to a burnt-out star that she could be diverted, decelerate, and go into orbit around it in order that the crew can make further studies. The risk comes from the fact that if the crew cannot find a roughly asteroid-sized body to provide feedstock for the mattercaster, the Exploration Authority will not be able to teleport enough mercury to the ship to provide enough propellant for Southern Cross to resume her journey to Alpha Crucis. More playboy than scientist, Maclaren is assigned to the mission he had promoted.

David Ryerson is a graviticist/tachyonicist born and raised in Scotland's Outer Hebrides. He has just married an Indonesian woman, Tamara Suwito, and has brought her home to meet his father, Captain Magnus Ryerson. The couple are preparing to emigrate to a planet just opened for colonization, but Magnus demands that David first serve a tour on the 
Southern Cross
. Reluctantly David agrees, if only for the extra pay.

Seiichi Nakamura lives on Sarai, an Earth-like moon of a gas-giant planet in the 
40 Eridani
 system. He has been selected to serve as 
Southern Cross's
 pilot and captain on this particular tour. Old traumas haunt him and his Zen discipline cannot relieve him of his fear of the dark star.

Chang Sverdlov, on Krasna, one of the planets of 
Tau Ceti
, has been assigned to be 
Southern Cross's
 engineer. Member of a nascent revolutionary movement, he is told to observe anything about the dead star that may be of military value. He is also being sent ""out of town"" to allay suspicions that are beginning to arise regarding his loyalty to the Protectorate.

Maclaren and Ryerson travel from Earth to the moon together and from the moon teleport onto the 
Southern Cross
. On the ship they find Nakamura and Sverdlov waiting for them and the four men immediately set to the tasks necessary to bring 
Southern Cross
 as close as possible to the dead star. As Nakamura backs the ship down, to put its trajectory into a close orbit around the star, the ion drive suddenly begins to vaporize itself and the mattercaster web: they have encountered interference from the star's magnetic field, which is far stiffer than anyone thought possible. In order to avoid crashing into the star Nakamura must fire the drive enough to put the ship into a stable orbit, doing so at the expense of further damage to the drive's ion accelerators and to the mattercaster web.

After making the necessary inspections Sverdlov states that the drive can be repaired well enough that the ship can maneuver around the dead star as they need and Ryerson states that he can repair the mattercaster web only to a certain point. To make a full repair of the mattercaster, so that the men can go home, Ryerson needs four kilograms of pure 
germanium
 in order to build the large and complex transistors that the web needs. Sverdlov and Ryerson go outside to repair the drive and while Nakamura is testing the drive under Sverdlov's directions, Sverdlov slips and falls, breaches his spacesuit, and dies.

Some months later the men find a planet, a ball of nickel-iron alloy a little smaller than Earth. From this planet's material they will extract the germanium that Ryerson needs. But first they must land 
Southern Cross
 on the planet and the ship was not meant to land on a planet. Using material scavenged from the ship's landers and other non-essential items, the three men build a tripod to protect the ion drive and the mattercaster web. Nakamura backs the ship down onto the planet, but one leg of the tripod buckles. Acting intuitively, Nakamura turns the ship to protect the mattercaster, but in so doing he puts the control turret he occupies directly under one thousand tonnes of crash-landing spaceship.

For weeks Maclaren cuts pieces out of the planet's metal surface and Ryerson extracts the little germanium they contain. Even on short rations they are running out of food. They get the germanium they need, Ryerson makes his transistors and finishes repairing the web, and then the two men begin the task of using their uncalibrated mattercaster to find a resonance that will take them to another ship or base, whence they can be rescued.

One day, as they are on the verge of starving to death, they find a resonance. In desperation Ryerson teleports himself to the receiver, leaving the more cautious Maclaren behind. Some time later Maclaren decides to follow Ryerson, but before he can do so Ryerson returns... draped across the arms of an alien wearing a spacesuit full of chlorine.

Some months later, still recovering his health from his ordeal, Maclaren goes to Sumatra to meet Ryerson's widow and give her his few small personal possessions. He tells her that the alien had examined his cobbled-together mattercaster, had located and marked resonances that led to his people's ships or bases, and then teleported back to his own ship. It had taken another week for Maclaren to find the resonance that took him to a human base, whence he was rescued.

Taking Tamara with him, Maclaren flies his aircar to the Outer Hebrides. She points out the house where Magnus Ryerson waits for them. Maclaren has come to tell Magnus about his son and to answer the old man's questions. Tamara's outburst, crying out the uselessness of going to the stars, touches Maclaren's own doubts. But Magnus simply says, ""For that is our doom and our pride,"" quoting from Rudyard Kipling's poem ""The Song of the Dead"". Magnus goes on to read from that poem the stanza that begins, ""We have fed our sea for a thousand years....""

Maclaren understands then and asks Magnus for his blessing.

First published in 
Destinies
, Vol 1, No 2 (Jan 1979), this novelette was first incorporated into 
The Enemy Stars
 in the 1987 Baen Books edition. The story is told in the first person, narrated by Voah, the alien who had brought David Ryerson's body back to the 
Southern Cross
.

Native to Arvel, a planet with a chlorine-rich atmosphere, Voah-and-Rero, husband and wife, had been serving a tour of duty on the starship 
Fleetwing
, also headed toward Alpha Crucis, when David Ryerson teleported into their receiver and died. Voah describes how he-and-Rero made the decision that he would take Ryerson's body back to Southern Cross and how he had helped Maclaren by finding and marking the resonances that led to Arvelan mattercasters.

Now, ten years later, he-and-Rero have come to Earth to participate in the tenth anniversary celebration of that first contact. In the midst of the celebration the Arvelans are taken secretly to Taiwan to meet with Terangi and Tamara Maclaren. The secret trip has been arranged by Vincent Indigo, their guide and general factotum while they are on Earth. Voah-and-Rero hope that in the time they spend with the Maclarens they will gain new insights into the nature of humans as they differ from Arvelans.

During the visit Indigo and three henchgoons invade the Maclaren house and kidnap the Arvelans. When it becomes clear that the kidnappers intend to kill one of them, Voah-and-Rero attack them, killing two of the terrorists and, with the help of Terangi, disabling the other two. Under interrogation Indigo admits that the kidnapping was carried out at the behest of the dictator to convince the Arvelans to withdraw from contact with humans. Voah then decides that he will recommend to his people that they negotiate a treaty that will lead to humans and Arvelans using each other's mattercaster networks."

Three generations after the departure of the 
Peerless
 from the home world, the ever increasing population (which can't be controlled due to spontaneous reproduction) overstreches its limited capacities. For a drastic solution, newborns are euthanized. The long mission of research is continued in the meantime: Tamara, an astronomer, studies an object on a course close to the 
Peerless
 and plans to dispatch the spacecraft 
Gnat
 to it. Carla, a physicist, studies light and finds a seemingly perfect ratio of five to four in one of her experiments. It has already been discovered that Nereo's equation (corresponding to the 
Maxwell equations
) makes wrong predictions. She conducts further experiments with her students to gather more data. Patrizia, one of these students, later goes over the mathematics of collisions and comes up with the hypothesis of 
quantization
 for particles of light, later known as Patrizia's principle (corresponding to the 
Planck relation
). She proposes luxites as names for the 
quanta
 after the luxagens causing them and an already proposed idea by an ancient philiosopher without evidence. Carla renames them into 
photons
 to avoid confusion. First surprised by the ingenious idea, which explains the data and in which an integer number of photons is necessary to give the luxagens enough energy to leave an energy valley, she soon notices some problems. She had studied wavelengths for which four or five photons carry enough energy and now wants to conduct new experiments for which six are necessary.

Carlo, a biologist, measures signals used by animals and himself to shapeshift their bodies. Previously it has been discovered through coloring, how their flesh can end up in different parts of their limbs during this process, giving rise to the question about how the ever changing communication with the brain works. Special attention is given to the signals by males to initiate reproduction. There are two kinds of species, where the females either divide in two or four children (biparteous and quadruparteous, latter of which is their own species). Carlo intends to measures those signals and swap them, potentially transferring the division into only two children artificially to their own species, solving the population crisis. Their way of reproduction also poses a problem to Tamaro, the co of Tamara and therefore supposed to trigger hers, who doesn't want her to go on board the 
Gnat
 and hence risk the lives of their children. Together with their father Erminio, he imprisons Tamara and spreads news about her having given birth on the 
Peerless
. Tamara can persuade Tamaro with a deal to let her go free and later joins the mission on the 
Gnat
 with Carla and Ivo. They cause an almost fatal detonation for them near the Object, pushing it on an almost parallel course with the 
Peerless
, It turns out, that the thermodynamic arrow and the arrow of entropy decrease of the Object point in the opposite directions and hence contact of any matter from the 
Peerless
 with the Object would again result in a detonation.

Carlo travels through the forest section inside the 
Peerless
 to catch the four arborines (two pairs of cos) for experiments. He then records the light signal of Zosimo when triggering the splitting of Zosima in two children and then sends it into one half of Benigna to mimick Benigno triggering her splitting. Benigna sheds a single female child and survives the birth injured. A successful experiment on their own species could turn the next election around, but time is running out. When this achievement is made public on the 
Peerless
 some males, fearing their upcoming extinction, set the entire forest on fire. Tamara, not wanting them to have the last word with violence, but knowing about the fatal consequences of Carlo's last experiment, agrees to have the arborine signal transmitted into a part of her body. She also sheds a single female child, who she named Erminia after her mother, and survives injured. Message of the birth is made public and swings the vote around, making the new technology available for every female choosing it and hence solving the population crisis.

Carla revisits some of the newly discovered physics and is saddened by the fact, that her legacy will ultimately only be to have taught Patrizia, whose name will go down in history with Patrizia's principle. She does some sketches involving an atom with three different orbitals as well as the emission and absorption of photons, one of which is reflected by a moving mirror to change its frequency, and finally realizes to just have come up with a process to make the eternal flame possible. Some time later, the space probe 
Eternal Flame
 is dispatched into space to demonstrate the engine indeed working, solving the fuel crisis. Some others, including Tamara and her daughter Erminia, are also watching. Carlo tells Carla to be delighted to have saved her life with his new technology, but she refuses to immediately make use of it, as she rather wants to wait what the new day will bring."

In the aftermath of a devastating nuclear war, Americans have come to blame technology for the disaster, and far from seeking to recover what was destroyed, are actively opposed to any such attempt.  Religious sects which even before the war opposed modern technology have adjusted to the post-apocalypse situation far more easily than anyone else, and have come to dominate the post-war society. All the pre-war American cities have been destroyed in the war, and their re-construction is expressly forbidden. The 
US Constitution
 has been amended, with the Thirtieth Amendment disallowing the presence of more than a thousand residents or the existence of more than two hundred buildings per square mile anywhere in the United States.

Len Colter and his cousin Esau are adolescent members of the New Mennonite community of Piper's Run. Against their fathers' wishes, the boys attend a preaching where a trader named Soames is stoned to death for his apparent involvement with a forbidden bastion of technology known as Bartorstown. They are saved when a trader, Ed Hostetter, intervenes. Hostetter grabs a box from Soames' wagon, from which Esau steals a radio.  Though sickened by the stoning and harshly punished by their fathers, Len and Esau are fascinated by the idea of a community that secretly still harnesses the forbidden technologies. Len's grandmother, a little girl at the time of the destruction, sparks his interest in the technological past with her stories of big, brightly lit cities and little boxes with moving pictures.

Esau and Len begin to work the radio, trying to make 'noise' come out of it. Esau steals three books from the schoolhouse in the hope that they would teach the boys to utilise the radio. The two are punished harshly after Hostetter outs them as thieves. The radio is smashed by Esau's father in rage, and Hostetter demands his wagon be searched lest he be accused of being a member of Bartorstown. Esau is whipped and Len's father is visibly disappointed. Subsequently, Esau and Len become determined to find their way to the fabled Bartorstown and leave Piper's Run in search of it, following broken dialogue heard over the radio towards a river.

The boys make their way to a town called Refuge, living with Judge Taylor and his family and working for a warehouse owner, Mike Dulinsky. Esau starts a romantic relationship with the judge's daughter, Amity Taylor. Dulinsky wants to build a fifth warehouse to compete economically with the town on the other side of the river, Shadwell. However, this would violate the Constitution's Thirtieth Amendment as the number of buildings would exceed two hundred. He rallies the Refuge residents, who initially pledge their support, but Judge Taylor warns Len and Dulinsky of the consequences and that he would go to the state authority. The Judge eventually betrays Dulinsky to the Shadwell residents. The Shadwell residents double-cross the Judge, kill Dulinsky and set fire to Refuge.

Len, Esau and Amity are saved by Hostetter, who is revealed to be an actual member of Bartorstown. Previously, he had to out Esau as a thief to conceal his own identity. Len is let down when Hostetter's ship turns out to be a coal-powered steamship, though eventually understanding it was for concealment. Hostetter wishes to settle in a place like Piper's Run, but is unable to do so. They make a long journey to Bartorstown, a place called Fall Creek Canyon. Hostetter remarks that even those who set foot in Bartorstown do not know it is 
the
 Bartorstown, as the scientific facilities were buried, and Fall Creek Canyon resembles any ordinary settlement. Before the journey is complete, Len begins to think of Hostetter as a father-figure, the latter reciprocating that sentiment.

In Fall Creek, Amity and Esau are wed, while the three are sworn to secrecy and are told they will be shot if they attempt to leave. The town's leaders seek to use the childlike vision that Len and Esau had of Bartorstown to inspire the workers, who have been working for a long time without an end in sight. Len becomes romantically tangled with Joan Wepplo, who possesses a red dress. Joan, in contrast to Len, has resented her upbringing in Bartorstown and seeks to leave, though the residents of Bartorstown are unable to.

The scientists of Bartorstown have been working on a long-term project with an artificial intelligence, Clementine, aimed at creating a forcefield that would eradicate the splitting of atoms, preventing future misuse of nuclear technology. They feed Clementine equations in the hope of creating the ultimate equation to produce the forcefield. Len is shocked to find that Bartorstown relies on nuclear power, conflicting with his religious beliefs that the devilish nuclear power which annihilated society should be abstained from entirely. The community's rationalisation that others would eventually unlock the lost secrets of nuclear technology and that it would be better to take preventive measures does not sit well with Len and his religious upbringing.

Len and Joan, now married, plot an escape from Bartorstown, and the two succeed, blending in with tribals to evade Bartorstown's surveillance. Len's journey is painful and he thinks of the long walk back to Piper's Run as his religious redemption. However, they are tracked down by Hostetter. The three sit together in a small town where a preaching is occurring, in similar circumstances where Soames was stoned. Len mentally prepares for himself to die, thinking of Soames and Dulinsky and the disillusioned Bartorstown scientists and acknowledging that change would come around eventually, even if he as an individual passed on. Len gives up the opportunity to out Hostetter as a Bartorstown member to the crowd to be stoned, and Hostetter reciprocates by not outing Len. Hostetter is revealed to have armed backup that would have shot Len and Joan if he had outed Hostetter, but Hostetter reiterates that he knew and trusted Len so long that he never would have needed the backup. Hostetter, Len and Joan then make their way back to Bartorstown."

Then strange messages from space aliens are received. Dr. Pat Adcock has a theory that the aliens have taken up the old Starlab space station. Adcock recruits pilots Jimmy Lin and Martin Delasquez, an elderly astronomer (Rosaleen Artzybachova), and close protection agent Dan Dannerman (who is actually a government secret agent).

When they first explore the Starlab, they find strange alien technologies. Then suddenly, they are transported through space. The aliens have kidnapped the group because the aliens, called ""Beloved Leaders"", are battling against a terrorist named the Horch. The aliens are battling for dominance of the ""Eschaton"", which gives eternal life. The humans then learn that they are just copies of their old bodies; their real bodies were sent back to the Earth with wiped memories. Other copies have been experimented on with vivisection."

Set thousands of years in the future (
AD
 5407), the human race has been conquered by the 
Qax
, a truly alien turbulent-liquid form of life, who now rule over the few star systems of human space – adopting processes from human history to effectively oppress the resentful race.

A human-built device, the Interface project, returns to the Solar System after 1,500 years. The project, towed by the spaceship 
Cauchy
, returns a 
wormhole
 gate, appearing to offer 
time travel
 due to the time 'difference' between the exits of the wormhole (relativistic 
time dilation
), with one end having remained in the Solar System and the other travelling at near lightspeed for a century. The Qax had destroyed the Solar System gate, but a lashed-up human ship (a great chunk of soil including 
Stonehenge
, crewed by a group called the 
Friends of Wigner
) passes through the returning gate, travelling back to the unconquered humanity of 1,500 years ago.

One of the crew of the 
Cauchy
 returns with the Friends, Miriam Berg. The Friends have a complex scheme, which does not include a simple military return-and-rescue – the 1,500-year technology gap makes this ""risible"". From the Wigner 
thought experiment
 they have postulated an unusual theory on the ultimate destiny of life in the universe. They believe that quantum wave-functions do not collapse like the 
Copenhagen interpretation
 holds, nor that each collapse actually buds off separate universes (like the 
quantum multiverse
 hypothesis holds) but rather that the universe is a 
participatory universe
: the entire universe exists as a single massive 
quantum superposition
, and that at the end of time (in the 
open universe
 of the Xeelee Sequence, time and space are unbounded, or more precisely, bounded only at the 
Cauchy boundaries
 of ""Time-like infinity"" and ""Space-like infinity""), when intelligent life collects all information (compare the 
final anthropic principle
 and the 
Omega Point
), it will transform into an ""Ultimate Observer"" and make the ""final Observation"", the observation which collapses all the possible entangled wave-functions generated since the beginning of the universe. They believe further that the Ultimate Observer will not merely observe, but 
choose
 which 
world line
 will be the true world-line, and that it will choose the one in which humanity suffers no Squeem or Qax occupations. However, the Ultimate Observer cannot choose between worldlines if no information survives to its era to distinguish worldlines- if the UO never knows of humanity, it cannot choose a worldline favourable to it. In other words, some way is needed to securely send information forward in time.

As a consequence of this necessity, they intend to turn Jupiter into a carefully formed 
singularity
 and use the precisely specified parameters as a method of encoding information. Miriam Berg is more concerned over the immediate fate of humanity, with the threat of the future Qax, and transmits a 'help' message to the gate designer Michael Poole.

The Qax, naturally, panic a little at the escape to the past. A complex, unavoidably fragile species in their huge living Spline spacecraft, the few Qax present are somewhat at a loss. They decide to build their own Interface, with major human-collaborator assistance (headed by Ambassador Jasoft Parz), to create a link to their future to gain aid in resolving the problem – with more modern 
GUT
-engine spacecraft they can make a 500-year link in just eighteen months. A startling high-technology future vessel (in truth, one of the legendary Xeelee nightfighters, an advanced and long-range fast scout ship), with a future Qax comes through the gate. Its first act is to execute the Qax Governor of Earth and gather up Parz, before passing through the original portal after the Friends and all humanity. The future Qax takes two Spline ships (presumably leaving behind the nightfighter; this might be the nightfighter that is discovered by the crew of 
The Great Northern
 millennia later in 
Ring
) through the gate and on the journey reveals to Parz the reason behind its desire to completely destroy the human race.



The Ring
[
edit
]


The future Qax tells Parz that over the centuries, the Qax had worn down humanity through constant oppression, and had eventually decided to eliminate its space-faring capabilities. But before they did, as economical traders, they wished to get as much value out of their human pilots as possible. So certain pilots were dispatched on a number of dangerous or quixotic missions.

One such pilot was a man named Jim Bolder. The Qax had come into possession of a Xeelee nightfighter, and had modified it to support human control. Bolder's mission was simple: go to the 
Great Attractor
, the cause of most 
galactic drift
, and find out why and how it exists. Bolder travelled to the bottom of the gravitational well, and found the Ring. A 
torus
 a thousand 
light-years
 in diameter, constructed of an unknown substance, rotating at a large fraction of 
lightspeed
. The Qax goes on to speculate that the torus created a 
Kerr metric
, and that it allowed egress from the current universe, that it was in effect an escape route for the Xeelee. Before Parz, the Spline warship, and the Qax exit the wormhole, the Qax asks, ""What do Xeelee fear, do you suppose?"". Regardless, Bolder escaped the Great Attractor and returned to the Qax home system, where he was supposed to be taken into custody by dozens of Spline warships wielding gravitational-wave based ""starbreakers"" and his priceless data on the god-like Xeelee's ultimate project secured. Bolder either did not, or somehow escaped; in the ensuing fight, the starbreakers were accidentally fired at the Qax system primary star, and true to their name, destabilised it, causing it to go 
nova
. The Qax were forced to hurriedly evacuate. Many died, and the power of the Qax trading empire (and by extension, their Occupation of Earth) ended.



Defeat
[

In the past, Poole joins Berg on the Friend vessel shortly before the Qax emerges, having travelled aboard his ship, 
Hermit Crab
, from the 
Oort cloud
. He is accompanied by a Virtual of his father, Harry. Together they elude the control of the Friends, whose project fails under the bombardment of the Spline's starbreaker beam. Miriam Berg commandeers the singularity cannon used to sculpt Jupiter and fires a pair of black holes into the Spline, which merge and disable it. Meanwhile, aided by Jasoft Parz's internal sabotage, Poole succeeds in ramming the 
Hermit Crab
 into the second Spline, killing the sapience of the vessel and the entangled Qax, second Governor of Earth, with it. Harry takes over in lieu of the higher intelligence and, at the direction of Poole, steers it back into the wormhole: when inside, Poole intends to activate the hyperdrive, shattering the fragile dimensional warping of the wormhole, and of all wormholes connecting to it, thus saving humanity from further interference by the future.

Poole's audacious plan succeeds, but with an unexpected side effect. As the hyperdrive activates, it somewhat shatters space-time, forming a long series of interconnected wormholes that hurl Poole 5 million years forward into the far future.  Poole discovers a sad cosmos, in which the stars are guttering out; the Friends were wrong- intelligent life would not triumph and remake the cosmos, eventually leading to their Prime Observer.

His ship shattered and broken, Poole begins dying, but at the last moment, an ""anti-Xeelee"" (whom it is implied is a being created by the Xeelee to be like them, except travelling like a 
tachyon
 backwards in time, the better to mould the Xeelee's early evolutionary history) takes a liking to Poole, and converts him into an intangible immortal being of ""quantum functions"". In this form, Poole travels the universe, but out of boredom, eventually begins to lapse into a quasi-coma- until an unexpected event occurs: a savage in a glass box, having travelled through a wormhole like Poole himself. ""History resumed."" (This final event is one of the early plot points of the 
Ring
.)

, England.

Mimi reaches old age and is hospitalised following a stroke. A young man named Calhoun Mooney, chasing an escaped homing pigeon, accidentally glimpses the Fugue hidden in the carpet, which profoundly affects him. Simultaneously, Mimi's granddaughter Suzanna Parrish arrives in the city at Mimi's behest. The mystery surrounding Mimi and the full potential of the carpet brings Cal and Suzanna together and quickly into confrontation with the primary antagonists: Immacolata, an exiled and extremely powerful member of the Seerkind bent on revenge; Shadwell, a human salesman with limitless ambition; and Hobart, a conscientious policeman.

Cal and Suzanna acquire new allies and abilities in their goal of protecting the Fugue from destruction, venturing into it themselves twice. When Shadwell's actions result in the Fugue's seemingly total obliteration, the surviving Seerkind scatter. In a last desperate attempt to finish them, Shadwell locates and awakens the Scourge, which begins systematically destroying any and all traces of magic it can find.

Cal, Suzanna and their remaining allies make a final stand against Shadwell by using his own tactics against him and convince the Scourge to abandon its cause and leave the world in peace. In the aftermath, a severely traumatised Cal is cared for by Suzanna whilst their friends adjust to permanent life amongst humanity. Eventually, Cal emerges from his withdrawal with the knowledge that the Fugue is still in existence and can be restored to its full glory."

Cover of the 1988 
Bantam Spectra
 paperback edition. Cover art by Jim Burns.


A series of brutal murders soon begins to panic the Budayeen, and Audran is almost executed by Friedlander Bey, who at first considers him to be the killer. He is then forced by the centuries-old Bey to become his investigator, and even worse, is made to subject himself to extensive, partly experimental 
cybernetic modifications
; an advanced form of the brain wiring he has dreaded before.

While the killer or killers brutally begin wiping out witnesses as well as acquaintances of Audran, he tries to uncover clues to their nature and to the link between the seemingly unconnected victims. The killer uses ""moddies"" to make himself into one of the most feared and bestial 
serial killers
 of history.

After being accosted by and overpowering the modified killer — who had begun stalking Audran himself with sadistic glee and patience — he is not convinced that everything is over, and finds that an important middleman in the Budayeen was behind some of the murders. When he confronts him, he is almost killed himself, and facing death, has to insert a special ""daddy"" which makes him go into a bestial frenzy, killing the murderer. However, in his rage, he also slaughters a captured policeman and 
mutilates
 both bodies horribly.

The gruesome nature of his self-defense disgusts his former acquaintances in the Budayeen. Friedlander Bey, in the final move sealing Audran's fate, then forces him to become one of his lieutenants to serve as a new middleman between the Budayeen and the police. As a result, Audran is viewed with suspicion by everyone and ends the novel with practically no friends."

She falls in love with one brother but marries another and becomes more Kerrion than some born to the name.

Q2746500,"Orson Scott Card brings us back to the very beginning of his brilliant Ender Quartet, with the novel that begins The Shadow Series and allows us to reenter Ender's world anew. With all the power of his original creation, Ender's Shadow is Card's parallel volume to Ender's Game, a book that expands and complements the first, enhancing its power, illuminating its events and its powerful conclusion. The human race is at War with the ""Buggers"", an insect-like alien race. The first battles went badly, and now as Earth prepares to defend itself against the imminent threat of total destruction at the hands of an inscrutable alien enemy, all focus is on the development and training of military geniuses who can fight such a war, and win. The long distances of interstellar space have given hope to the defenders of Earth--they have time to train these future commanders up from childhood, forging then into an irresistible force in the high orbital facility called the Battle School. Andrew ""Ender"" Wiggin was not the only child in the Battle School; he was just the best of the best. In this new book, card tells the story of another of those precocious generals, the one they called Bean--the one who became Ender's right hand, part of his team, in the final battle against the Buggers. Bean's past was a battle just to survive. He first appeared on the streets of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else's.

Q111442660,"""Riveting, disturbing, and rendered in masterful detail."" --Leigh Bardugo In the 2050s, Earth has begun to empty. Those with the means and the privilege have left the great cities of the United States for the more comfortable confines of space colonies. Those left behind salvage what they can from the collapsing infrastructure. Their neighborhoods are being cannibalized, brick by brick, with materials being sent up to the colonies as a quaint reminder of the world that they wrecked. A primal biblical epic flung into the future, Goliath weaves together disparate narratives--a space-dweller looking at New Haven as a chance to reconnect with his spiraling lover; a group of civil servants attempting to renew the promises of Earth's crumbling cities; a journalist attempting to capture the violence of the streets; a marshal questioning what form justice could even take--into a richly urgent mosaic about race, class, gentrification, and who is allowed to be the hero of any history."

Valente's science fiction spectacle, where sentient races compete for glory in a galactic musical contest…and the stakes are as high as the fate of planet Earth. A century ago, the Sentience Wars tore the galaxy apart and nearly ended the entire concept of intelligent space-faring life. In the aftermath, a curious tradition was invented—something to cheer up everyone who was left and bring the shattered worlds together in the spirit of peace, unity, and understanding. Once every cycle, the great galactic civilizations gather for the Metagalactic Grand Prix—part gladiatorial contest, part beauty pageant, part concert extravaganza, and part continuation of the wars of the past. Species far and wide compete in feats of song, dance and/or whatever facsimile of these can be performed by various creatures who may or may not possess, in the traditional sense, feet, mouths, larynxes, or faces. And if a new species should wish to be counted among the high and the mighty, if a new planet has produced some savage group of animals, machines, or algae that claim to be, against all odds, sentient? Well, then they will have to compete. And if they fail? Sudden extermination for their entire species. This year, though, humankind has discovered the enormous universe. And while they expected to discover a grand drama of diplomacy, gunships, wormholes, and stoic councils of aliens, they have instead found glitter, lipstick, and electric guitars. Mankind will not get to fight for its destiny—they must sing. Decibel Jones and the Absolute Zeroes have been chosen to represent their planet on the greatest stage in the galaxy. And the fate of Earth lies in their ability to rock."

I want it to be massively detailed, and completely believable. If you need props and evidence to back it up, then we can create them.

His magic will soon threaten not only the wild and distant Outskirts, but even the Inner Lands themselves. The wizard must be stopped. But first, somehow, he must be found. In the seaside town of Alemeth, the Steerswomen's Annex holds centuries of records. There, Rowan might find clues to the wizard's location. And happily, she also finds a lost friend: Janus, a steersman who had resigned his membership in the Steerswomen, giving no explanation. Now Rowan has hope for help in her search - But Janus has changed. The bright intellect is now shrouded in a dark, shattered spirit... When sleepy Alemeth becomes a place of terror; when death and chaos move in from the wildlands; when doubt and lies surround the steerswoman at every turn - then all Rowan's questions are reduced to one, the single question that drives every member of the Steerswomen: Why?

A sorceress must balance her desire to become the first great female magician against her duty to her family. Beatrice Clayborn is a sorceress who practices magic in secret, terrified of the day she will be locked into a marital collar that will cut off her powers to protect her unborn children. She dreams of becoming a full-fledged Magus and pursuing magic as her calling as men do, but her family has staked everything to equip her for Bargaining Season, when young men and women of means descend upon the city to negotiate the best marriages. The Clayborns are in severe debt, and only she can save them, by securing an advantageous match before their creditors come calling. In a stroke of luck, Beatrice finds a grimoire that contains the key to becoming a Magus, but before she can purchase it, a rival sorceress swindles the book right out of her hands. Beatrice summons a spirit to help her get it back, but her new ally exacts a price: Beatrice’s first kiss . . . with her adversary’s brother, the handsome, compassionate, and fabulously wealthy Ianthe Lavan. The more Beatrice is entangled with the Lavan siblings, the harder her decision becomes: If she casts the spell to become a Magus, she will devastate her family and lose the only man to ever see her for who she is; but if she marries—even for love—she will sacrifice her magic, her identity, and her dreams. But how can she choose just one, knowing she will forever regret the path not taken?"

Q44900825,"From Daryl Gregory, whose Pandemonium was one of the most exciting debut novels in memory, comes an astonishing work of soaring imaginative power that breaks new ground in contemporary fantasy. Switchcreek was a normal town in eastern Tennessee until a mysterious disease killed a third of its residents and mutated most of the rest into monstrous oddities. Then, as quickly and inexplicably as it had struck, the disease–dubbed Transcription Divergence Syndrome (TDS)–vanished, leaving behind a population divided into three new branches of humanity: giant gray-skinned argos, hairless seal-like betas, and grotesquely obese charlies. Paxton Abel Martin was fourteen when TDS struck, killing his mother, transforming his preacher father into a charlie, and changing one of his best friends, Jo Lynn, into a beta. But Pax was one of the few who didn’t change. He remained as normal as ever. At least on the outside. Having fled shortly after the pandemic, Pax now returns to Switchcreek fifteen years later, following the suicide of Jo Lynn. What he finds is a town seething with secrets, among which murder may well be numbered. But there are even darker–and far weirder–mysteries hiding below the surface that will threaten not only Pax’s future but the future of the whole human race."

Q96650197,"A decadent rock star. A deeply religious radio host. A disgraced scientist. And a teenage girl who may be the world’s last hope. From the mind of Chuck Wendig comes “a magnum opus . . . a story about survival that’s not just about you and me, but all of us, together” (Kirkus Reviews, starred review). NOMINATED FOR THE BRAM STOKER AWARD • ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The Washington Post, NPR, The Guardian, Kirkus Reviews, Publishers Weekly, Library Journal, Polygon Shana wakes up one morning to discover her little sister in the grip of a strange malady. She appears to be sleepwalking. She cannot talk and cannot be woken up. And she is heading with inexorable determination to a destination that only she knows. But Shana and her sister are not alone. Soon they are joined by a flock of sleepwalkers from across America, on the same mysterious journey. And like Shana, there are other “shepherds” who follow the flock to protect their friends and family on the long dark road ahead. For as the sleepwalking phenomenon awakens terror and violence in America, the real danger may not be the epidemic but the fear of it. With society collapsing all around them—and an ultraviolent militia threatening to exterminate them—the fate of the sleepwalkers depends on unraveling the mystery behind the epidemic. The terrifying secret will either tear the nation apart—or bring the survivors together to remake a shattered world.

Q579744,"'A stunning work of art that bears no comparisons' the New York Observer wrote of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, 'and this is also true of this magnificent new novel, which is every bit as ambitious, expansive and bewitching. A tour-de-force of metaphysical reality, Kafka on the Shore is powered by two remarkable characters. At fifteen, Kafka Tamura runs away from home, either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister. And the aging Nakata,tracker of lost cats, who never recovered from a bizarre childhood affliction, finds his highly simplified life suddenly overturned. Their parallel odysseys, as mysterious to us as they are to them, are enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Fish tumble in storms from the sky; cats and people carry on conversations; a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle. Yet this, like everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own."

The Actual Star takes readers on a journey over two millennia and six continents --telling three powerful tales a thousand years apart, all of them converging in the same cave in the Belizean jungle. Braided together are the stories of a pair of teenage twins who ascend the throne ofa Maya kingdom; a young American woman on a trip of self-discovery in Belize; and two dangerous charismatics vying for the leadership of a new religion and racing toward a confrontation that will determine the fate of the few humans left on Earth after massive climate change. In each era, a reincarnated trinity of souls navigates the entanglements of tradition and progress, sister and stranger, and love and hate--until all of their age-old questions about the nature of existence converge deep underground, where only in complete darkness can they truly see. The Actual Star is a feast of ideas about where humanity came from, where we are now, and where we're going--and how, in every age, the same forces that drive us apart also bind us together."
